JENSEN: And get cheated again?
POOCH: The Pooch don't cheat. The Pooch may lie, the Pooch may steal
JENSEN: the Pooch may refer to himself in the third person
POOCH: but the Pooch will not cheat.
JENSEN: The Pooch can rest easy, I was referring to Cougar.
ROQUE: The four take them. Lick the back, slap them to their foreheads two deuces ( Jensen and Roque ), a three ( Pooch ), and an eight ( Cougar ). Pitiful cards.
JENSEN: Got a feeling about this one, Roque.
ROQUE: Your mama had that feeling too.
POOCH: ( INTRIGUED )
ROQUE: Oh, shit, I'm definitely in then.
POOCH: Oh, shit, I'm definitely in then.
JENSEN: This even me up?
ROQUE: Exactly how many knives do you have, anyway?
POOCH: Cougar - your bet.
CLAY: It's time.
CLAY: Authenticate and backtrace.
POOCH: ( GRUMBLING )
JENSEN: ( FINISHES CHECKING )
ROQUE: ( DISTASTE )
CLAY: We don't get to pick what needs to be done. ( reading from tablet ) Quaeda-wannabe name of Fadhil is running a terrorist assembly line out around the Khyber Pass
JENSEN: I'm shocked. Shocked, I say.
CLAY: We find it, we paint it for a laser targeted bomb. No muss, no fuss.
ROQUE: For that we had to put on a blindfold and turn around three You'd rather take on fifty mujas with AK's?
POOCH: You'd rather take on fifty mujas with AK's?
ROQUE: I got eyes on Fadhil.
CLAY: Paint it.
POOCH: Call me Michelangelo.
JENSEN: Dropkick, this is Pinball, confirmed eyes on, target is designated.
JENSEN: Roger, we'll break out the earplugs. ( to the others ) So who wants to get a game? We got eight minutes-
COUGAR: Clay immediately looks THROUGH HIS SCOPE
CLAY: Call it in.
JENSEN: ( INTO RADIO )
ROQUE: Maintain position? Colonel-
JENSEN: ( INTO RADIO )
CLAY: Mission Controller is Agency, Codename Max, repeat, Codename Max, so get him on the horn and-
CLAY: Cougar takes the butt of his rifle and SMASHES THE LASER DESIGNATOR TO BITS! Clay, into the radio:
CLAY: Who is this? This is a secure
MILITARY NETWORK: MAX ( O.S. ) Very stupid, Colonel. Franklin. Clay blinks - no one uses names on comms.
CLAY: Max? There are children on site-
CLAY: Shit! Jensen, call the General at the Firebase, get him to abort-
JENSEN: Can't, they're jamming us-
ROQUE: Then contact the plane directly-
JENSEN: ( trying all channels ) Negative, we're screwed!
CLAY: There's something we can do.
ROQUE: Five against a fortress, and we've got maybe six minutes before an airstrike sets the world on fire.
CLAY: So, I'll drive.
ROQUE: So, I'll drive.
POOCH: I guess we're going with the fifty mujas with AK's option after all!
CLAY: Pooch and Jensen, get a truck for the kids, the rest of us will be out in five-
ROQUE: ( CHECKING WATCH )
CLAY: -out in four. On me!
LITTLE BOY: Clay checks the time. 3 MINUTES TO AIRSTRIKE.
CLAY: ( to Roque and Cougar ) Get 'em out.
PERVERT: Omar DOESN'T MOVE. Instead, he eerily raises his hand and wordlessly POINTS TO A CELL. In the corner. And Clay hears a MOAN emit from it. VAGUELY HUMAN.
SOMETHING HORRIFIC: .shooooot meeee.
CLAY: You're American?
SOMETHING HORRIFIC: .Max sent you.
CLAY: ( SURPRISED )
SOMETHING HORRIFIC: .was IA Field Ops hunting rogue agents. Max caught me.
CLAY: Max is rogue?
SOMETHING HORRIFIC: You're off-mission aren't you?
CLAY: SOMETHING HORRIFIC
SOMETHING HORRIFIC: Max doesn't care about Fadhil. He's cleaning up the mess. You're his mop. I'm the mission..
CLAY: I can get you out-
SOMETHING HORRIFIC: Already dead. Kill ME-
COUGAR: Holds up his watch. 40 SECONDS LEFT. Speaks another:
POOCH: Jesus, you stop for coffee in there?
ROQUE: What kind of blast radius we looking Jensen, calculating on the computer tablet. Shows an animation mock-up to Roque - huge blast radius. To Pooch:
JENSEN: I think we're in the clear-
POOCH: Uh, Coug?
JENSEN: Yeah, that was great, wasn't it? My favorite part was when we were completely on fire. What was yours?
POOCH: Exfil incoming. How are we gonna explain the kids, Colonel?
CLAY: Lieutenant, you're to evac these civvies to the Firebase immediately-
BLACKHAWK PILOT: Negative, our orders are to transport a five-man team only.
CLAY: You really want to leave twenty three kids in the desert to die?
BLACKHAWK PILOT: Not enough room for them and you.
CLAY: Then it's them.
JENSEN: Clay helps Omar on last. The kid looks at him. He knows perfectly well what Clay saved him from in that basement.
OMAR: Clay nods. A beat. The Pilot pulls the stick back and the CHOPPER ASCENDS. The kids wave goodbye to our guys.
POOCH: Cute little buggers. Hope they can make it to our court-martial.
ROQUE: Relax, Pooch, we're not going to be court-martialed - if anything, we're going to die of thirst wandering the desert, right Colonel?
CLAY: ( IGNORES THIS )
POOCH: So, how we getting back? Hitchhike? Magic carpet? I say magic carpet.
ROQUE: ( NOTICING )
JENSEN: Guys. This is bad.
POOCH: Auto-rotate, go with it, you can still put her down if you-

NO!: MIG PILOT ( O.S. ) .Fox Two. The SECOND MISSILE from the MiG SLAMS INTO THE BLACKHAWK proper. Burning, spinning. FALLING. Clay and Cougar, screaming by the time they reach the wreck.
FENNEL: What are you talking about "MAX?"
CLAY: He set up the Operation-
FENNEL: There was no operation! You were never radioed orders!
CLAY: I talked to him!
FENNEL: You kill a friendly Afghan warlord, probably lose us the support of half the tribes in the region, and your alibi is "MAX?"
CLAY: Colonel, Max is an Agency code for a rogue agent or operation-
FENNEL: Colonel, Max is an Agency code for a rogue agent or operation-
CLAY: What are you talking-
WADE: "Max" is catch-all for exactly what you've been accused of. Terminology's been around since the 50's.
CLAY: We didn't kill those kids, Wade. Wade studies him. Finally:
WADE: I believe you.
FENNEL: Stay here. We'll be back.
POOCH: Wade left his suitcase.
ROQUE: Ah, shit.
CLAY: ( nodding to the case ) I'm not good with bombs, man-
JENSEN: I'm not good with bombs, man-
CLAY: I don't careRoque, Pooch, get those bars off!
JENSEN: Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
CLAY: First set of screws out, moving onto the second.
JENSEN: It's a remote detonatorenough for them to get clear, maybe ten
CLAY: CAN YOU-
JENSEN: I told you, I'm not good with bombs! How are those bars coming?
POOCH: Shut up.
ROQUE: Shut up.
POOCH: Shut up.
ROQUE: Shut up.
THE LOSERS: FADE UP:
ROQUE: ( FLAT )
CLAY: We lost again.
ROQUE: You placed the bet.
CLAY: You gave me the money.
ROQUE: Well, that was stupid of me, wasn't Clay drums his fingers along the binocs as he scans. We see on his right hand, between his thumb and index finger - A TATTOO. A TEDDY BEAR. Looks just like Omar's.
CLAY: Something glint-flashes.catches Clay's eye. He looks across the track, towards the PARKING LOT.
ROQUE: You know where you're messing up? You're putting all our money on the dogs with the best odds.
CLAY: Yeah, I've just gone crazy with that approach.
ROQUE: Never play a longshot, you're never gonna win.
CLAY: Maybe if we were drinking.
ROQUE: You're not drinking?
CLAY: We'll stay two more days, try to get some of the cash back.
ROQUE: Then what?
CLAY: Miami. Jai-Alai.
ROQUE: I can't take much more of this.
CLAY: We're on the run. It occasionally
ROQUE: I'm serious. Grinding out lunch money on five dollar sports bets, wincing everytime some overly Aqua- netted cow stares at my face for more than two seconds-
CLAY: All we did was say the word "Max" and they blew up a building. CIA even gets a whiff of where we're at, they'll call in an airstrike. ( shakes his head ) Until we figure out how we can take Max down and get clear, we lay low.
ROQUE: Due respect, you're nobody's Colonel Anytime you want to move along you go right ahead-
CLAY: Anytime you want to move along you go right ahead-
ROQUE: Like the others? Least I still talk to them. You pushed them away. "Max this, Max that" - we never even saw the guy, Clay-
CLAY: We heard his voice. Guy with a voice is a guy with a throat. And if he's got a throat.
ROQUE: ( IN DISBELIEF )
CLAY: No, it's a stellar plan - we can use this as our base of ops! ( gestures to the
ROQUE: No, it's a stellar plan - we can use this as our base of ops! ( gestures to the
PLAYGROUND ): Pooch can run the motor pool out of the ball pit and Jensen can set up communications by the slide!
CLAY: Roque FIRES UP THE ENGINE as the COPS get out of the cruiser. Pulling smoothly into the street.
ROQUE: I was there too. I remember. But he won. We lost.
AISHA: Clay turns back to his food. Not used to attractive women instigating conversation. Aisha watches as Clay eats.
CLAY: She's still watching him. It's getting annoying.
AISHA: I don't eat red meat.
CLAY: Why not?
AISHA: Slows me down.
CLAY: Aisha studies Clay. If we've been paying close attention, we might ID her as the race track binocular chick. We're not sure if Clay does.
AISHA: You got nice arms.
CLAY: ( turning to her ) I know you?
AISHA: Relax, slugger. I like arms. That's all.
CLAY: Do I not look relaxed?
AISHA: ( PAUSE )
AISHA: ( DEADPAN )
CLAY: No, I specifically requested the only hotel room in the world that doesn't have a bathroom.
AISHA: You lookin' to turn a "yes" into a "no" here?
AISHA: So what brings you to Florida?
CLAY: AISHA ( O.S. ) Convention for what?
CLAY: .Air conditioners.
AISHA: They have whole conventions devoted to air conditioners?
CLAY: You'd be surprised.
AISHA: Bet I would. Where were we?
CLAY: You were about to tell me how much you enjoy spending time at the dog Aisha smiles, tracing her fingers down his stomach.
AISHA: Saw me there did you?
CLAY: Didn't see me at the McDonald's Their lips, inches from touching.
AISHA: Didn't see me at the McDonald's Their lips, inches from touching.
CLAY: You're not going to.
AISHA: Yes, I am.
CLAY: Noticed. What do you want?
AISHA: Your life. Back.
CLAY: You want to clarify that?
AISHA: Max. I can help you.
CLAY: I'm listening.
CLAY: How'd you find me?
AISHA: It's not too tough if you know where to look. You guys aren't exactly subtle.
CLAY: How'd you know I was alive?
AISHA: Counted the number of teeth found in the safehouse debris in Karachi. Not nearly enough for five men.
CLAY: Who else knows?
AISHA: That you're alive? Just me.
CLAY: So what's to stop me from putting a bullet in your head?
AISHA: You want Max and I can tell you how to get him.
CLAY: Max is up to something big, isn't he? Agency wouldn't have sent you She gives a little smile.
AISHA: Nice try, but I'm working alone here. If I wasn't, I wouldn't need your help. Ready for the important part?
CLAY: This plane contains a truck.
AISHA: This plane contains a truck.
CLAY: This truck contains a cargo.
AISHA: This truck contains a cargo.
CLAY: This cargo is very important.
AISHA: This cargo is very important.
CLAY: Is this a riddle?
AISHA: ( FORCED SMILE )
CLAY: What a brilliant plan, and oh, so simple too. What's the cargo?
AISHA: ( he turns back ) You really think I look good in these jeans?
CLAY: Cargo's heroin. Max uses it to fund his off the books ops. And it comes straight from the poppy fields of the late Jamal al-Fadhil. ( knowing full well ) Oh. does that name mean something to you?
AISHA: Cargo's heroin. Max uses it to fund his off the books ops. And it comes straight from the poppy fields of the late Jamal al-Fadhil. ( knowing full well ) Oh. does that name mean something to you?
CLAY: How do I know I can trust you?
AISHA: Check my background. I'm an ex- Company hitter. First job was a junior field officer in Shanghai. You can Google it under Shanghai Hilton Decapitation.
CLAY: I mostly Google porn. Then?
AISHA: Two Chinese and an Italian arms dealer in Bangkok. With my hands.
CLAY: Show-off. Then?
AISHA: Then I stopped auditioning for you. This is a check for ten grand-
CLAY: We're not mercenaries.
AISHA: Operational capital, that's all. ( holding out the check ) You've been waiting three years for a shot at this guy. You're not gonna get another. You want Max, this is it. He takes it. She hands him some papers along with it.
SHORT SCIENTIST: You know we cannot do this. We cannot do what you ask.
MAX: Tell me - is this a moral issue or a financial issue?
FAT SCIENTIST: A moral issue.
MAX: ( ACTUALLY CURIOUS )
FAT SCIENTIST: Yes. I'm sorry. Please leave.
MAX: Okay, here's what I'm hearing. I'm hearing "No." I'm hearing "Leave," and I'm hearing "I'm sorry." Is that what I'm hearing?
FAT SCIENTIST: Please. you must leave.
MAX: Right. Okay, so that is what I'm hearing. Now, I want you to listen. Listen carefully because I want you to hear this. Wade?
WADE: You gave me the nod.
MAX: A "hit him in the face" nod, not a "throw him out the window" nod.
WADE: I thought that's what you wanted.
MAX: At mostat most that was a "break his fingers" nod. ( slams his fist ) I mean Jesus, Wade, the man was scientific genius. Granted his weight signaled that he had certain impulse control issues, but that's no reason to throw his fat ass out a fifty story window.
WADE: ( as if to a child ) I think I speak for everyone here when I say that your actions were excessive and, yes, more than just a little wasteful.
MAX: ( as if to a child ) I think I speak for everyone here when I say that your actions were excessive and, yes, more than just a little wasteful.
SHORT SCIENTIST: Wade stops.
MAX: The hell you say.
SHORT SCIENTEST: One to test?
MAX: Of course one to test - you think I trust you?
SHORT SCIENTIST: We will need much money.
MAX: You will have much money.
MAX: Call our people at Goliath, tell them we'll have a special package arriving on the 17th.
CLAY: Better than a ball pit.
ROQUE: You sure you're thinking clear on ( off Clay's look ) I know you. When you slip, it's always cause of a woman.
CLAY: Name one time that-
ROQUE: ( INSTANTLY )
CLAY: Carla wasn't the problem, Carla's husband was the problem-
ROQUE: Carla's husband wasn't the one who
CLAY: Okay. Yes. She shot me.
ROQUE: What about Emma?
CLAY: Emma doesn't count, we never slept Because she put a bomb in your I admit, that took some of the romance out of the relationship.
ROQUE: Because she put a bomb in your I admit, that took some of the romance out of the relationship.
CLAY: I admit, that took some of the romance out of the relationship.
ROQUE: And now this chick, first time you meet her, burns down our hotel. Also, she kills people for a living. These are not good signs.
CLAY: I'm clear, Roque.
ROQUE: You better be. Or we're done.
POOCH: Damn. We missed you too.
POOCH: Jesus, Lady! Ten outta ten for stealth and shit, but next time could you just knock?
ROQUE: How long you been back there?
AISHA: Long enough.
CLAY: She was volatile. Aisha, meet Pooch, Roque, and Cougar.
AISHA: Really? You can't hang out with anyone just named "Phil"?
JENSEN: Hail, hail, the gang's all here! Colonel. Roque. Pooch. Silent Bob. Hottie.
AISHA: I'd expect no less.
CLAY: What do you have on her?
JENSEN: Besides a pants-busting crush?
ROQUE: ( DEADPAN )
CLAY: What else?
JENSEN: Grew up in Afghanistan, Mom was a local, Dad was white devil. oh, and CIA's got a kill order out on As does Hamas, Sien Fein, MOSAAD pretty much everyone with the exception of PETA wants this chick Last CIA email flagged with her name says she was digging for information about a special ( looks up at them ) "Codename: MAX". A moment as this sinks in.
POOCH: Last CIA email flagged with her name says she was digging for information about a special ( looks up at them ) "Codename: MAX". A moment as this sinks in.
JENSEN: Last CIA email flagged with her name says she was digging for information about a special ( looks up at them ) "Codename: MAX". A moment as this sinks in.
POOCH: They want to wet her cause she's lookin' into Max. That sounds Could those files-
ROQUE: ( DUBIOUS )
JENSEN: ( finishing his question ) -have been planted for us to find? ( shaking his head ) CIA timestamp, digital watermark. Someone would've had to go to a lot of trouble, and I mean a lot, to fool me.
CLAY: I say we go with her. Pooch?
POOCH: I'm in.
CLAY: Hell yeah. Cougs?
JENSEN: Hell yeah. Cougs?
ROQUE: For now.
JENSEN: Hot damn! Back with the Colonel, doing another bid for God and
ROQUE: Country turned her back on us, and God can screw. This one's for us.
CLAY: And anyone who calls me "Colonel" better be ready to take a beating or an order. We ain't soldiers So what's the plan, my civilian Sleep. We start tomorrow.
POOCH: ( HAPPY NONETHELESS )
CLAY: Sleep. We start tomorrow.
JENSEN: Start where?
CLAY: We're going bird hunting.
MAX: 90 percent of the globe is tooling up to whack us and we're too busy losing our nerve to notice. It's Us versus Them and right now my money would be on them.
WADE: The Company's with you on this?
MAX: Kinda. Sorta.
WADE: I don't. Just want to make sure everyone gets paid.
MAX: The money's coming from our Afghanistan operation. And what the Company doesn't know won't hurt them.
WADE: Unless they're within the blast Max puts his hand on Wade's shoulder. Earnestly:
MAX: We're gonna saving our country, Wade. The United States of America will benefit greatly from what we're doing.
WADE: I was born in Quebec.
MAX: Jesus, fine - we're saving North America, does that make you happy? Just get it done.
JENSEN: ( into radio; drawls ) Roger that Cav 415, we have a report of a civilian vehicle breakdown on U.S. 70, sector nine, grid four. Please assist as required.
DRIVER: Army of one, my ass. Goddamn Triple A service.
SOLDIER 1: Need a hand, buddy?
POOCH: Appreciate it.
SOLDIER 1: AAOW! Something just bit me!
CLAY: The sound of HEAVY IRON RELEASING as the WALLS START TO SEPARATE, revealing we are INSIDE THE BROKEN-DOWN TRUCK.
JENSEN: Base One, this is Cavalier 415! We have been in a collision with a civilian vehicle! Carvey's dead an' Freeman's hurt bad! He's messed up his neck! He can't move! Oh god, it's horrible! We need medevac immediate! HE'S GOT KIDS, BASE
JENSEN: Robert De Niro who?
POOCH: Sleeping like babies.
ROQUE: What about their ride?
CLAY: Flip it. TIGHT SHOTS of the air ram attached to the undercarriage of the Humvee. The tires start to lift off the ground. higher. Four pairs of hands start rocking the truck.
POOCH: What do you think's up with that "don't call me Colonel" stuff?
JENSEN: Classic loss of identity. Clay defined himself by his place in the military structure.
CLAY: All right, everyone get into Jensen and Roque LIE ON THE GROUND by the flipped Humvee.
JENSEN: Lot of work to bum a ride.
ROQUE: Shut up, Jensen.
JENSEN: You shut up, Roque. You're dead, I'm the spinal injury - Spinal injury can talk, dead can't.
ROQUE: Stop talking or I'll break your neck for real.
JENSEN: Seriously, you have to get more into your role! Dead guy! No talking! Dead guy!
CLAY: Here we go.
PILOT: ( INTO RADIO )
EMT: Alright buddy, we're gonna get you patched up in no time.
JENSEN: Y-you ever treat anyone who'd been gut shot.
EMT: Sure, in Iraq. What a mess.
JENSEN: Means you know what's coming to you if try to play hero. Now, lose the radio mic, Bones.
PILOT ONE: What are they jawing about out there? We're burning fuel
POOCH: You heard of car-jacked? You've just been chopper-jacked, my man.
PILOT ONE: You're robbing the US Army?
POOCH: When he says it out loud, it does sound kinda ridiculous.
CLAY: Where's my wild goose?
JENSEN: We're all set here. Ready to take a giant step for. well, for guys who steal stuff, I guess.
CLAY: Hit it.
JENSEN: Beautiful. Let 'em chase that.
POOCH: Time to move.
DRUGGED SOLDIER: .Well, shit.
POOCH: .no, what you want is a gas turbine generator running a force- fed rectifier unit, hook it up to the fuel tank.
JENSEN: So, you grew up in the Hindu Kush, huh? That must've been rough.
AISHA: ( watching the chopper ) Got any hobbies?
JENSEN: Got any hobbies?
AISHA: When I was a girl, I collected human ears. I had over three dozen pairs when a feral dog came into our camp one night and took them. The dog was good eating, though. A beat.
JENSEN: I'm gonna go somewhere else now.
AISHA: Are small arms gonna be a problem?
POOCH: It's taken care of - we lined the hull with half inch steel plate.
ROQUE: Which brings us to our next He PULLS a DESERT EAGLE and LEVELS IT at Aisha's skull.
CLAY: I'm giving you a chance to get even. That's all you need to know.
AISHA: I'm giving you a chance to get even. That's all you need to know.

ROQUE: She's coming with us. And if anything feels like a set-up, I put a bullet in her skull.
AISHA: Oh, completely. Now, if you'll excuse me, it's time for prayers.
ROQUE: You're Muslim?
AISHA: You know, you are a sharp oneand don't let any of these other boys tell you different.
ROQUE: I don't like this.
CLAY: I picked up on that.
POOCH: I'm with Roque, man. Agency thinks we're dead. We show up alive and kickin', start waving our dicks around in public, they're gonna make it their business to bury us. They'll call us terrorists, all
CLAY: What do you think we are now? ( to all of them ) Best case scenario, this gets us face to face with Max-
ROQUE: What if it doesn't? What if we never get face to face with him. Are you gonna be able to live with that? Ever?
POOCH: Hell, let's just say it out loud.
COUGAR: They started it.
FENNEL: As of this moment, the truck is designated an extraterritorial zone of immunity. Under no circumstances whatsoever are you or your men to allow the package to leave the truck before it's secure in the compound - to do so would be considered an act of treason and punishable as such.
LIDDY: Understood and acknowledged, sir. As the package is loaded into the MONSTER ARMORED RIG.
WADE: Ten men ride with the package and another ten ride chase.
CLAY: Are we wired?
JENSEN: Like Belushi.
COUGAR: TWO HUNDRED FEET ABOVE GROUND. Lashed into a BRIDGE SUPPORT. He racks the bolt of his NTW-20 ANTI MATERIAL RIFLE - a monster of a weapon with a bulky starlight scope.
SWAT DRIVER: Shit, I'm losing it!
WADE: Form a defensive perimeter around the truck!
FENNEL: They're out of their minds, there's no way off this bridge.
WADE: Masks on! Secure the package!
SWAT GUY: Where are they? I can't see them-
FENNEL: Code RED! We are under attack! Need Chopper Support right now!
DOORS: Cavalry's here!
WADE: Cavalry's here!
FENNEL: What the hell? It's welded shut!
SWAT GUY: ( REALIZING )
FENNEL: We're down, okay! You go the second the ramp lowers! Hit them hard, three round bursts, center mass!
AISHA: Open the valve.
FENNEL: These guys are about to get the surprise of their lives.
SOLDIER 1: Sir, that smell! It's- gasoline!
FENNEL: Eat the ground, or they blow your head off!
CLAY: I don't think so.
FENNEL: First and only warning, Clay!
CLAY: Gasoline. Muzzle flash. Think about it. AS THAT SINKS IN Fennel looks like his puppy just died.
FENNEL: Clay, no bullshit - you open that box and we all die. Clay steps up to him. Near nose to nose.
CLAY: I'm already dead, remember?
JENSEN: Goliath the oil company?
AISHA: It must be how he moves the drugs.
ROQUE: Great. The super evil bad guy is in bed with the world's largest oil company. That's just fabulous.
POOCH: You want me to go ask Fennel the Nah, I can bypass no problem.
JENSEN: Nah, I can bypass no problem.
POOCH: Is that.?
CLAY: The TIMER display BLINKS ON and begins COUNTING BACK
POOCH: Is that.?
CLAY: Yeah. Jensen, you're up.
JENSEN: The bomb.
CLAY: The bomb.
JENSEN: ( HOLLOW )
CLAY: Get better.
JENSEN: Okay. Okay.
ROQUE: SHOULD WE- ( TYPING FAST )
JENSEN: ( TYPING FAST )
POOCH: What if that sets it off?
CLAY: Then we die thirty seconds early - do it.
POOCH: I got wires - red, blue, green, white, yellow-
JENSEN: ( STILL TYPING )
POOCH: There's also pink-
JENSEN: Hold position!
AISHA: Are you trying to make this more Almost. Almost. Shit!
JENSEN: Almost. Almost. Shit!
AISHA: Computer crashed!
JENSEN: Computer crashed!
POOCH: Are you kidding me?
JENSEN: Yes, cause this is the time for

JENSEN: I told you, I'm not good at bombs!
CLAY: Do you have time to reboot?
POOCH: Okay, someone pick a color!
AISHA: ( STRANGELY CALM )
ROQUE: You ever hear of a clock radio that exploded cause you unplugged itpull out all the wires.
AISHA: You ever hear of a clock radio that exploded cause you unplugged itpull out all the wires.
JENSEN: Opening it without the code must have triggered the timer.
POOCH: You think?
ROQUE: Did you know?
AISHA: I just saved our lives-
ROQUE: ( FEVER PITCH )
AISHA: Of course not!
ROQUE: ( CONFUSED )
CLAY: INT. CHINOOK WINDOWLESS HOLD NIGHT The Losers stand around Fennel, who's been CRYING. Urine stain on his pants. Sniveling, spilling his guts rapidly:
FENNEL: Max thinks the country's lost it's way, gone soft in the War on Terror! This is his solution!
CLAY: He wanted us to nuke a U.S. target, pin it on the ragheads and boom - freedom is on the march again! The same people who want us to pull back will be screaming to turn the place into a parking lot!
FENNEL: He wanted us to nuke a U.S. target, pin it on the ragheads and boom - freedom is on the march again! The same people who want us to pull back will be screaming to turn the place into a parking lot!
POOCH: What was the target?
FENNEL: I CAN'T-
SCREAMS: FENNEL ( CONT'D )
JENSEN: ( AMAZED )
AISHA: What about Goliath?
JENSEN: Yeah, what would an oil company want with the Middle East?
FENNEL: ( STILL FREAKED )
ROQUE: This is conspiracy theory bullshit-
FENNEL: It's not! There's proof!
CLAY: Max's heroin operation - Goliath keeps accounts of the shipments!
FENNEL: Max's heroin operation - Goliath keeps accounts of the shipments!
JENSEN: Come on, dude, they'd be morons to keep records of shit like this-
FENNEL: It's on a stand-alone hard drive! It's their insurance policy against Max - they know he's crazy, this way they have something on him!
CLAY: So this hard drive - it contains evidence of what Max has been doing?
FENNEL: Our guys exchange looks.
CLAY: Can you get us this drive?
FENNEL: I don't know where it is! They don't let me have access! But-
CLAY: I say we hit Goliath headquarters.
ROQUE: And do what - go after this non- existent hard drive?
CLAY: We find out if it exists. If it does, we steal it and trade it for Roque stares at him.
ROQUE: That's your plan?
CLAY: You got a better one?
ROQUE: Why risk our lives again when we already have something to trade?
CLAY: You want to give it back to him?
ROQUE: I want to at least discuss it before signing up for another suicide mission on the say-so of some flunky-
CLAY: It's not happening.
ROQUE: So you want to take down Goliath now? Then who? McDonald's? American Airlines? Microsoft?
CLAY: You don't want Max to pay?
ROQUE: I want my life back! This is supposed to be us getting clear - not saving the world!
POOCH: We're not the goddamn good guys anymore! I love you guys, but I had a life before this shit, and I sure as hell am not going to risk getting it back because you came down with a case of the Dudley Damn Do-Rights!
ROQUE: We're not the goddamn good guys anymore! I love you guys, but I had a life before this shit, and I sure as hell am not going to risk getting it back because you came down with a case of the Dudley Damn Do-Rights!
CLAY: Don't raise your voice at me-
ROQUE: I will raise whatever the hell I want - you got a death wish because you got beat by a voice on a radio-
POOCH: I say we hit Goliath. Jensen?
JENSEN: Goliath. Cougs?
CLAY: She doesn't get a vote-
ROQUE: She doesn't get a vote-
AISHA: ( staring at Roque ) Silence. Roque, ODD MAN OUT. His fingers tighten around the handle of the knife.
POOCH: ( SOFTLY )
CLAY: You want your life back, you're gonna have to steal it. We hit them in two days.
JENSEN: Don'tcha hate it when Mom and Dad Cougar grunts in response.
POOCH: So what do we do about the nuke?
AISHA: I have an idea.
WADE: That's gonna be a quick trial.
MAX: Wonderful guy, salt of the earth, he'll be missedwho took my bomb, You're not gonna like it.
WADE: You're not gonna like it.
MAX: Because I've been such a fan of how things have gone up till now?
WADE: Colonel Clay and his unit. You had them killed three years ago?
MAX: I also had several African nations overthrown three years ago, I'm a
WADE: The Jamal al-Fadhil situation?
MAX: Okay, they need to get dead. Get me a six man fire team ready in twelve hours.
WADE: Okay, they need to get dead. Get me a six man fire team ready in twelve hours.
MAX: Okay, they need to get dead. Get me a six man fire team ready in twelve hours.
WADE: So what's the plan?
MAX: What's the plan? The plan is - get me a six man fire team ready in twelve hours.
WADE: Are we now clear on the plan or do you want to try a third go-around?
MAX: Are we now clear on the plan or do you want to try a third go-around?
WADE: WE'RE CLEAR-
MAX: Because what I'm going to need you to do is get me a six man fire team ready in twelve hours. You get that, right?
WADE: I get it.
MAX: And Wade?
SHORT SCIENTIST: We appreciate you meeting us in a single story facility.
WADE: No problem.
SHORT SCIENTIST: I agree. Now that we know each other, know, please, that if you come near me with any more of that Yankee Doodle tough guy bullshit, you will be fed to my dogs.
WADE: Fair enough, Doc. Can we now move past the verbal aggression and get into some business?
SHORT SCIENTIST: You want another device. One billion dollars is now the price. One billion dollars cash.
WADE: That's going to be difficult.
SHORT SCIENTIST: Life the way you people want to live it is very difficult, Mr. Wade. You want less difficult move to my country, study Hinduism. Meditate. Cultivate serenity. Much less difficult. You want to buy atomic bombs. I'm afraid that is a more difficult way of And he smiles.
WADE: He wants one billion in cash.
MAX: That's a lot of a paper routes.
WADE: Can we swing it?
MAX: Not even close.
WADE: The Company?
MAX: Won't give it to us willingly.
WADE: Change of plans. Kill them.
MAX: Change of plans. Kill them.
WADE: Kill them?
MAX: Or fire them, whichever's easier.
WADE: Honestly? Firing them.
MAX: Fine, fine, I'm not a detail guy. What I need- wait. Did you give them intel on Clay's people?
WADE: Well, yeah.
MAX: Aaaand we're back to killing them.
WADE: ( ANNOYED )
MAX: Touchy, touchy. Jeez, what are you related to them?
WADE: Actually, one of them, yes.
MAX: By blood?
WADE: ( he's had it ) A brother-in-law, I said I'd kill him, what are we doing?
MAX: It's not what we're doing, it's what Clay is going to do for us.
WADE: And that is?
MAX: ( GRINNING )
CLAY: I was just going over the plan.
AISHA: So, what really happened to you in Clay looks over at her. Down at the TEDDY BEAR tattoo. And shakes his head.
CLAY: ( SOFTLY )
AISHA: He's a bad man. Isn't that enough?
CLAY: A beat. She looks at him.
AISHA: When you tell me about Afghanistan? I'll tell you about Max.
CLAY: Fine. It's hot. There's lots of sand. Your turn.
AISHA: Why were you alone when I found That takes Clay off guard. Looking out at the city.
CLAY: The guys got sick of it.
AISHA: Sick of what?
CLAY: Of hearing about Max. Of hearing me say we had to do something when there wasn't anything to do. They wanted to be around their families. Jensen has a sister. Pooch has a wife and daughters.
AISHA: And he hasn't told them he is alive?
CLAY: Would you? The people you loved the most, would you put them in that kind of danger? Aisha, side-stepping the question:
AISHA: So Roque has no one.
CLAY: He's got me.
AISHA: And you have.
CLAY: Enough hate to get us both through the day. He stuck with me when no one else would. And I ain't the easiest guy to stick with.
AISHA: If you two really fought, he would kill you, I think.
CLAY: You think.
AISHA: I'm almost sure of it.
CLAY: Because you care what happens to the others. You wouldn't put them at risk to save yourself.
AISHA: Because you care what happens to the others. You wouldn't put them at risk to save yourself.
CLAY: And you think that's a weakness.
AISHA: I know it is. Law of the jungle.
CLAY: We're not in the jungle.
AISHA: Oh, yes we are.
ROQUE: Well, that's just great.
POOCH: We're not going anywhere until you two squash this shit.
CLAY: Pooch, we're on a schedule here-
POOCH: Good. Roque?
ROQUE: Sorry I threatened to cut your head off.
POOCH: Verrrry good. Now don't you two feel better?
POOCH: I don't give a shit, I do. ( starts the van ) Now, let's go watch Jensen single- handedly knock over the largest oil company on the planet.
JENSEN: ( SINGING )
JENSEN: ( STILL SINGING )
RECEPTIONIST: Excuse me one moment-
JENSEN: No can do, chica, gotta put it in his hands. He's gotta sign.
RECEPTIONIST: ( back on phone ) I'm sorrycould you say that again?
JENSEN: Babydoll, I'm on the clock here!
RECEPTIONIST: Forty fifth floor.
JENSEN: ( SINGING )
JENSEN: ( ON PHONE )
SECRETARY: Who's calling, please?
JENSEN: Richard Hertz from Internal One moment, please.
SECRETARY: One moment, please.
JENSEN: Ladies. hi.
HENDERSON: This is Henderson.
JENSEN: Good afternoon, Mr. Henderson, Richard Hertz from Internal Security. If you'd be kind enough to make your way down to the lobby?
HENDERSON: Uh. Can I ask what this is about?
JENSEN: It's a matter of a somewhat sensitive nature involving an
JENSEN: Hi, I'm Skippy from tech support. Is Henderson around? I'm supposed to install a firewall on his system-
SECRETARY: Oh, you just missed him by like two seconds. Can you come back in like an hour or so?
JENSEN: Oooooh - no can do. Upstairs breathing down my neck. They want security upgraded for the senior managers all of a sudden.
SECRETARY: BACK IN HENDERSON'S OFFICE: Jensen checking his download. Smiles at the Secretary, then looks back to he screen. Pressing his RADIO
JENSEN: According to this, the drive exists, INTERCUT WITH THE VAN: Clay shoots a look at Roque.
CLAY: You're sure?
JENSEN: Is it in the building?
CLAY: Is it in the building?
JENSEN: No, somewhere off-site. It's gotta be a remote location, stand-alone. I'm checking their security logs wherever they've detailed the most guys is probably where it'll be.
JENSEN: Whoa! Take it easy. You're the-
JENSEN: I'm warning you, man, I'm a lethal Jensen turns on the big fellah.
JENSEN: The guard is HIT HARD, BLASTED BACKWARDS off his feet! Screaming in pain, he goes down. Jensen spins, aims his left fingers at the SECOND GUARD.
THIRD GUARD: Please- d-don't shoot.
JENSEN: Face down, or I'll make your hearts stop beating with my mind.
COUGAR: De Nada.
MAX: By your boys?
WADE: They're not "my boys". I don't like this. I say we grab Clay and kill the rest.
MAX: ( STILL LISTENING )
WADE: I can.
MAX: ( into phone; JAPANESE )
WADE: You're sure? You're not going to call me in two hours and have me kill them? ( off Max's look ) I'm on it.
JENSEN: Everything on Goliath - security, personnel history, the works. Aisha's brow furrows at this. Only we notice.
CLAY: Where's the drive being kept?
JENSEN: Port of New York, baby. Total stand alone facility, and they're spending 30K a day on onsite security - you don't drop that kinda green to just guard oil.
ROQUE: What are we up against?
JENSEN: Let me check, Ioh, shit.
CLAY: What's "oh, shit"?
JENSEN: They've hired Par-Sec. A beat. This clearly means something bad to all of them.
CLAY: ( HONESTLY )
AISHA: Who's Par-Sec?
JENSEN: Paradigm Security Services. Ex- Special Forces.
POOCH: Basically guys like Cougar but without the warm and cuddly side.
CLAY: Goliath must have brought them in after we hit their truck.
JENSEN: Our drive is being guarded by military trained, trigger repressed, blood thirsty, stone cold killers. Am I the only one who's thinking maybe we just chill out and go to Six Flags?
CLAY: Comb that drive for every last scrap of info. We're on a plane for New York tomorrow.
CLAY: Oh, hi.
ROQUE: Thought you guys'd be back at the Couldn't sleep.
POOCH: Couldn't sleep.
ROQUE: Me neither. Grabbed a coffee from the machine - you want one?
POOCH: No thanks.
JENSEN: You won't believe how detailed these files are. Every Goliath executive they've ever insured, their policies, their payouts-
ROQUE: Life insurance?
JENSEN: What's the biggest payout?
ROQUE: What's the biggest payout?
JENSEN: ( STILL TYPING )
ROQUE: Pretty much what we're gonna be What are you doing up?
POOCH: Jensen hacked a satellite for me The hell you need a satellite for? Pooch shows him the screen of his computer - RECORDED VIDEO from earlier in the day. An OVERHEAD VIEW of a Playground - POOCH'S DAUGHTERS PLAYING. They both watch for a bit. The only sound, Jensen's typing. Then:
ROQUE: The hell you need a satellite for? Pooch shows him the screen of his computer - RECORDED VIDEO from earlier in the day. An OVERHEAD VIEW of a Playground - POOCH'S DAUGHTERS PLAYING. They both watch for a bit. The only sound, Jensen's typing. Then:
POOCH: When we first went over in 2001, Jolene and my oldest Tina wanted to do the yellow ribbon thing, right? Only problem was there was no yellow ribbon to be found - all the stores had been cleaned out.
ROQUE: Military neighborhood.
POOCH: No doubt. And Tina's four at the time, and what she can't understand is why the ribbon's gotta be yellow. So Jolene sings her the song, right? To show her where the idea comes from. And when she's all done, Tina, four years old, looks my wife dead in her eye and says "that's the dumbest song I ever So my wife and my four year old ended up tying a frilly purple ribbon round the old oak tree in our yard to bring Daddy home.
ROQUE: ( SMILING )
POOCH: POOCH ( CONT'D )
ROQUE: I hear you, man.
JENSEN: ( READING )
CLAY: You really want to know about INT. VAN ( MOVING ) NIGHT As Pooch TEARS through the Texas streets:
JENSEN: You think she's gonna kill him?
JENSEN: Yeah, I think so too.
AISHA: And this man you found in the basement - he was your true target?
CLAY: Max's true target. Yeah.
AISHA: And you spoke with him?
CLAY: He knew we were off mission. He knew Max wanted him dead.
AISHA: Did he beg?
CLAY: Excuse me?
AISHA: The man in the basement. Did he beg for his life?
CLAY: He begged to diewhy are you asking me this?
JENSEN: Roque and Pooch behind him, GUNS DRAWN. Aisha's hand dips into her purse and comes up with a GUN faster than you can spit MEXICAN STAND-OFF TIME:
AISHA: ( CALM )
JENSEN: I know it makes no sense, but actually yes.
CLAY: TAPS HIS EAR. They stop. Listening. CHOPPERS.
ROQUE: Shit, she's got back-up!
COUGAR: The FIRST COBRA OPENS UP with it's AUTOMATIC CANNON. The BULLETS CHEWING UP the far side of the CHEAP TWO STORY MOTEL! Our guys VAULT the railing, sprinting to the van.
ROQUE: Go, go, go!
POOCH: Think that got her?
CLAY: She ain't that lucky. Jensen, My dick remains unshot!
JENSEN: My dick remains unshot!
ROQUE: Here they come.
CLAY: Somebody shoot something!
JENSEN: I think Cougar's got a plan! Coug, do you have a plan? ( to the others ) He's got a plan!
POOCH: ( trying to steer ) Stop yelling at the sniper! THROUGH THE SCOPE Cougar sights the TAIL ROTOR of the chopper on the left. Smiles, PRESSES THE TRIGGER.
WADE: They got away.
MAX: ( MORE ) MAX ( CONT'D )
SHORT SCIENTIST: Do you have the money?
MAX: Jesus, always with the money! So impersonal! How are you? How have you been?
SHORT SCIENTIST: I recently attended the funeral of my best friend who you had thrown out a window. How have you been?
MAX: Can't complain. I'm thinking of getting satellite radio in my car.
SHORT SCIENTIST: I think you're a freak. Too much Ronald McDonald. Too much fantasy Max smiles and spreads his arms.
MAX: Hey, I'm all about the bombs, baby.
SHORT SCIENTIST: We have your ordinance. You have twenty four hours to get the money.
MAX: Time to go make a withdrawal.
SHORT SCIENTIST: New change of plan. You stay.
MAX: I've got to go get your money.
SHORT SCIENTIST: He'll get your money. You stay right here.
MAX: God, are you short.
SHORT SCIENTIST: Twenty three hours, fifty nine Max looks at Wade.
MAX: Get it done.
SHORT SCIENTIST: I do not think you are funny.
MAX: Where the hell is my bomb?
SHORT SCIENTIST: You do not get it till I get the For a guy who's all about transcending materialism, you talk about money so much!
MAX: For a guy who's all about transcending materialism, you talk about money so much!
SHORT SCIENTIST: If you keep talking, Pop-Amm will cut your mouth out of your face.
MAX: INT. MEDICAL SUPPLY STORE NIGHT After business hours. A WINDOW SMASHES. Roque climbs inside. Goes to the front and unlocks it for the others, who carry a BLEEDING JENSEN in. They lay him on a table.
POOCH: She burned us, Clay.
CLAY: ( PACING )
POOCH: The whole op is compromised-
CLAY: I know.
JENSEN: Hey, fallen comrade here! Blood flowing out of his body.
CLAY: ( RE: JENSEN )
JENSEN: What's that for?
POOCH: So we split up again. Right?
ROQUE: ( IGNORING HIM )
POOCH: ( IGNORING HIM )
CLAY: ( SLOWLY )
ROQUE: So we just run again?
CLAY: There's nothing else we can do.
ROQUE: There's something we can do.
CLAY: Excuse me?
ROQUE: Three years is enough. If there's a drive at that port that we can use to get clear-
CLAY: What part of "he knows we're coming for it" do you not get? They're gonna be waiting for us. Par-Sec is gonna waiting for us.
ROQUE: So figure out a way around them; you're good at that shit, Clay!
CLAY: Pooch, what's the minimum time to scout the patrols, get an accurate head count on-site at the Port?
POOCH: 48 hours, but Aisha knows that-
CLAY: So we hit them in twelve.
POOCH: Twelve hours from now? You mean you want us to go in blind?
ROQUE: Last thing they'll expect.
POOCH: Yeah, cause it's dumb.
CLAY: Jensen's already got the layout, and Cougar can spot on site. Right?
JENSEN: Yeah, cause gettin' shot is awesome, I'm totally up for doing it again.
CLAY: Pooch, struggling with the decision.
POOCH: Last time we went in blind on an op, we lost everything.
CLAY: A beat. Pooch looks up.
POOCH: So let's go get it back.
CLAY: You ready?
ROQUE: I'm ready.
CLAY: ( INTO RADIO )
POOCH: The Pooch is good.
COUGAR: EXT. NEW YORK HARBOR Clay and Roque dock their Launch and hop out. Blending in perfectly with the Par-Sec Guards.
CLAY: Jensen, we're coming. You ready?
JENSEN: And the crowd goes wild.
JENSEN: What's the password?
JENSEN: Drive should be in the Computer Room, two skylights over.
CLAY: Roque and I will set the charges here but we won't detonate until you have the drive.
ROQUE: You can't settle for stealing the drive, you gotta blow up Goliath's shit too.
CLAY: What can I say, I hold a grudge.
BACK TO: Cougar in full sniper fire position. His sights dead on: A MASTER FIRE ALARM 300 yards down. His RADIO CRACKLES:
POOCH: Wade's here.
CLAY: Are you kidding me?
JENSEN: I'm above the computer room, maybe thirty seconds from the drive.
CLAY: Something's not right. Something.
CLAY: Roque, standing in front of a HUGE CARGO CONTAINER.
ROQUE: I think you should see this. Roque's got the doors of the container opened that he's looking in. Clay approaches.
CLAY: You think. Aisha?
ROQUE: No. Not Aisha.
POOCH: Jensen, you get it? Jensen?
WADE: Hello, Clay. Been awhile.
CLAY: After the truck. I got tired of waiting for you to save us, so I up and saved myself. Reached out like I said and cut a deal - I set this up, I go free.
ROQUE: After the truck. I got tired of waiting for you to save us, so I up and saved myself. Reached out like I said and cut a deal - I set this up, I go free.
CLAY: You gave me no choice. It was always gonna end like this, Clay. Us captured or dead. It was always a dead end. You made sure of it.
ROQUE: You gave me no choice. It was always gonna end like this, Clay. Us captured or dead. It was always a dead end. You made sure of it.
CLAY: ( SPITTING BLOOD )
ROQUE: Not bullshit. You were gonna keep planning missions and ways to hit Max until it got us all killed.
CLAY: Yes, Clay. Yes. Only difference with this situation is at least I get to walk away.
ROQUE: Yes, Clay. Yes. Only difference with this situation is at least I get to walk away.
CLAY: We all could have walked. used the drive.
ROQUE: Don't you get it yet? There is no drive. There never was.
CLAY: Kill me now. Maybe you live through this.
WADE: Oh, we're not gonna kill you. Someone's gotta get away with the cash. Your crew? I'm definitely wasting them. But you?
ROQUE: They stop. Roque looks at his old friend.
CLAY: You're going to die very badly. The guards hustle Clay out the door.
CLAY: ( answering the question ) Cougar lowers his head, sadly. Clay's pushed into A TRUCK.
LEAD GUARD: On your knees.
BOTH LEGS!: Pooch SCREAMS. Falls. The Par-Sec boys force Cougar and Jensen down too, CLUBBING THEM with their rifles. Pooch looks up at his assailant. Gasps through the pain:
POOCH: Get on with it.
LEAD GUARD: That's a nice hat.
AISHA: As she rises up to standing, A SLANT-K 600 ROCKET HIP BLASTER locked and loaded. Looking like an Old Testament style Goddess of Vengeance and Destruction. A moment of FROZEN SHOCK on the rest of Wade's Hit Crew.
JENSEN: Shouldn't have gone after the hat.
POOCH: I've been shot in both legs, what kind of dumbass question is that?
JENSEN: Oh, so we're Mr. Grumpy now? You're not the only one who's been shot recently, you know!
AISHA: Did you kill my father? Jensen comes running up, interrupting:
JENSEN: Kind of in the middle of something here, Jensen-
CLAY: Kind of in the middle of something here, Jensen-
AISHA: Did you kill him?
JENSEN: There was no drive, Clay-
CLAY: ( eyes on Aisha )
JENSEN: There was no drive and Roque's gone and Par-Sec's regrouping and Pooch could bleed out-
AISHA: Did you kill him?
AISHA: Wear it. Remember him.
JENSEN: Okay, excellent, very tribalWe need to go.
CLAY: Can you stand?
POOCH: This is stupid question day, isn't it? It's stupid question day and someone forgot to tell me.
CLAY: Let's go.
CLAY: They won. We lost. Way it goes.
POOCH: Way it always goes.
COUGAR: Where to, Colonel?
WADE: Your friends jack-rabbitted. Should we be worried?
ROQUE: Clay doesn't take risks. It's why I'm here and he's not.
WADE: You're sure?
ROQUE: They were good guys.
WADE: No such thing. I'll go call Max.
CLAY: Hi, Wade!
ROQUE: Declan, start the plane.
POOCH: Next time, remind me - car crash first, then get shot.
JENSEN: Sounds less painful that way.
CLAY: Cougar and I are going after that plane. The rest of you, get Wade.
JENSEN: Me and legless Pooch are on it!
POOCH: You call me legless Pooch again, you're gonna be Headless Jensen.
JENSEN: What, it's a cool name! It makes you sound like a pirate! ( off his look ) Fine, let's go kill Wade.
ROQUE: Huddled in the plane's CARGO HOLD, RETURNING FIRE. The PILOT, yelling to him.
PILOT: We don't have enough runway to take off - we're going to have to turn around and come back to get up to speed!
ROQUE: Fine, just get us in the air! He fires ANOTHER BURST from his weapon at the Vette! CLICK - his WEAPON DRY.
CLAY: I'm out.
JENSEN: Yoo-hoo! Wade! ( a'la the Warriors ) Come out and plaaaayyy-
ROQUE: Gotta admit, I always wondered how this would play out.
CLAY: Aisha thinks you kill me.
ROQUE: It's a distinct possibility.
CLAY: Don't need one.
ROQUE: Bit of as longshot for you.
CLAY: ( SMILING )
ROQUE: Now I really am gonna cut your head off.
CLAY: The Pilot PULLS THE TRIGGER. The bullet slams into Clay's abdomen and BLOWS HIM off his feet backwards FLYING OUT OF THE PLANE And landing on hood of
THE CORVETTE: Clay SMASHES DOWN ON the windshield Cougar pumps the brakes and spins the wheel desperately trying to keep Clay from rolling off the hood.
THE PLANE: TURNING AROUND at the end of the runway. Beginning it's final run to get up to speed.
THE CORVETTE: Now driving TOWARDS IT on a chicken-like collision course when WHOOSH! WADE FLIES PAST ON HIS MOTORCYCLE! Clay turns to Cougar through the spiderwebbed windshield:
VISUALIZE THIS: AT ONE END OF THE RUNWAY, the plane starting to take off.
THE CORVETTE: PULLS EVEN WITH WADE. Instead of shooting, Clay THROWS Cougar's RIFLE BETWEEN THE SPOKES of Wade's FRONT TIRE, causing the bike to
JENSEN: Not to rain on everyone's we killed all the bad guys parade, but we should probably get gone - legless Pooch has a Learjet all gassed up for us in the Hangar. ( off Pooch's look ) It's a cool name-
CLAY: INT. NORTH INDIA HANGAR DAY MAX and the INDIANS. INTERCUT with Clay:
MAX: We good?
CLAY: Not by a longshot. You're not having a real great day, Max.
MAX: Who is this?
CLAY: Just a voice on the phone.
MAX: Where's Wade?
CLAY: Working on the engines.
MAX: It's Colonel.
CLAY: It's Colonel.
MAX: Colonel, yes. Well done.
CLAY: Thank you.
MAX: I understand you've always wanted to meet face to face. I'm sure that could be arranged.
CLAY: I don't think the guys you're about to stiff for a billion dollars are going to allow that to happen. ( looks to the others ) We win. You lose. Goodbye.
POOCH: ( GRINNING )
AISHA: I wanted to find and punish those responsible for my father's death. Max, his men, everyone.
CLAY: That why you slept with me?
AISHA: That and the cardio.
CLAY: You coming?
AISHA: I'm coming.
CLAY: Good cause there's no way I could walk it. She helps him up and we begin to PULL UP AND BACK as they head for the Hangar. Together.
SHORT SCIENTEST: Time is up, Stretch.
MAX: Stretch. That's a good one.
SHORT SCIENTEST: Because you are so much taller than I.
MAX: Yeah, no, I get it.
