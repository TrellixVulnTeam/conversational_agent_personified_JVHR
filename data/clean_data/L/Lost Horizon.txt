LOST HORIZON: Written by Robert previous hit Riskin
FADE IN[1]: Over the titles we see SUPERIMPOSED the snow-capped mountains leading to CLOSE-UP of an impressive-looking book. The covers open and the pages turn. The first page reads:
PILOT: Conway, we can't take more than seven!
CONWAY: ( to passenger )
CONWAY: Wait, wait! Everybody, wait! There are plenty of planes coming. Now everybody have patience. Everything will be all He crosses to a back room.
GEORGE: You have nothing to worry about. Leave everything to my brother.
RADIO OPERATOR: Yes, sir - with seven passengers aboard.
RADIO SPEAKER: Seven passengers? Good.
CONWAY: Get me Shanghai.
OPERATOR: I'm talking to them now, sir.
CONWAY: Hello? Hello?
RADIO SPEAKER: Hello. Hello.
CONWAY: ( into mike )
COLONEL'S VOICE: Right here, Conway. Go ahead.
CONWAY: Colonel, I need more planes. I've still about twenty people to get out. Where are those planes you promised us?
COLONEL'S VOICE: We sent everything we could find, Conway.
CONWAY: They better get here soon or I can't be responsible
GEORGE: Bob! I think I hear motors!
CONWAY: ( listening - then into mike )
GEORGE: He starts for the door.
CONWAY: And be sure that none of the natives get in.
GEORGE: ( exiting )
CONWAY: Hello? Colonel?
COLONEL'S VOICE: Hello, Conway. Yes?
CONWAY: Thanks - and take care of that liver of yours.
COLONEL'S VOICE: Oh, ho - my word!
CONWAY: All right, get ready everybody. The planes are here.
CONWAY: One at a time. Children first. Where are they? Come on now, and stand over A woman pushes some children forward.
CONWAY: Where's the mother?
PRIEST: ( standing nearby )
CONWAY: I see. All right.
OLD MAN: What about us, Mr. Conway?
CONWAY: Gentlemen, please wait your turn.
GLORIA: You'd better take some of those squealing men with you first. They might faint on you. I'll wait.
CONWAY: Just as you say!
CONWAY: ( sharply )
GEORGE: The power house - they've blown it up! The planes can't land without lights.
CONWAY: ( thinking fast )
INTERIOR HANGAR: 16. FULL SHOT It is filled with Chinese refugees clinging to their household goods. Conway and George enter. Conway speaks to them in Chinese, ordering them out. Some hesitate, and they have to push the terror-stricken waiting coolies out. When they have all left, Conway opens the spigots of several gasoline tanks, waits for the fuel to spill on the ground, then tosses a lantern on the fuel, igniting a blaze. At the same moment, he and George dash for the door.
EXTERIOR FIELD: 17. LONG SHOT Conway and George rush out of hangar. When they are at a fairly safe distance, the building bursts into flames.
CONWAY: All right, go ahead!
GEORGE: Right, Bob.
CONWAY: Hello, Fenner.
FENNER: ( broad grin )
CONWAY: You never mind me. Get this gadget off the ground.
GEORGE: Bob, these are all that are left.
CONWAY: ( to George )
MAN: You can't leave me here, you blighter.[2] I'm a British subject!
GEORGE: Look out, Bob!
CONWAY: ( yells off )
CONWAY: Get down on the floor, everybody. Go ahead, Fenner!
GEORGE: Fenner, let's go!
CONWAY: ( mumbling )
GEORGE: Whew! That was close.
CONWAY: Where did you come from?
LOVETT: I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.
CONWAY: Why aren't you registered through our ? 478 ? ( chiming in )
GEORGE: ( chiming in )
LOVETT: ( high-pitched voice )
CONWAY: Where were you hiding?
LOVETT: Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly
CONWAY: I know - and a war broke out right over your head.
GEORGE: The next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British Aha - very good, Freshie.[3] Very good. You'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later.
CONWAY: Aha - very good, Freshie.[3] Very good. You'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later.
BARNARD: I beg your pardon, brother. What did you say you were hunting?
LOVETT: Fossils, huh?
BARNARD: Fossils, huh?
LOVETT: I'm a paleontologist.
BARNARD: ( blankly )
LOVETT: A paleontologist.
BARNARD: Oh, I see.
LOVETT: I have here a discovery that will startle the world. It's the vertebrae from the lumbar of a Megatherium,[4] found in Well, what do you know about that!
BARNARD: Well, what do you know about that!
LOVETT: Found in Asia!
BARNARD: When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
LOVETT: When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
BARNARD: Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
LOVETT: ( proudly )
BARNARD: This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded ( he is allowed to take it out and examine it - unimpressed )
LOVETT: This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded ( he is allowed to take it out and examine it - unimpressed )
BARNARD: ( he is allowed to take it out and examine it - unimpressed )
LOVETT: You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
BARNARD: Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
LOVETT: It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
BARNARD: Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
LOVETT: Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.
BARNARD: Ah, poor fellow.
LOVETT: Yes, it just shows
BARNARD: ( turns away )
LOVETT: Don't call me brother.
BARNARD: Okay, sister.
BARNARD: Gloria turns her head, surveys Barnard coldly, and without responding, turns I say, will you have a cigarette?
BARNARD: I say, will you have a cigarette?
GLORIA: ( unabashed )
BARNARD: ( unabashed )
GLORIA: ( irascibly )
GEORGE: ( holds up bottle )
GEORGE: Just what I needed too.
CONWAY: ( looks up - smiling )
GEORGE: Just this once, Bob. I feel like celebrating. Just think of it, Bob - a cruiser sent to Shanghai just to take you back to England. You know what it means.
CONWAY: ( after a slight hesitation - downing his drink )
GEORGE: How I'm going to bask in reflected glory!
CONWAY: Don't talk nonsense. Give me the bottle.
GEORGE: That's why they're sending for you, Bob. With all these foreign entanglements, it was bound to happen. They need you.
GEORGE: All right, you can laugh if you want to. But who else can they get? Who else is there in all of England half the fighter, half the diplomat, who
CONWAY: ( drunkenly )
GEORGE: Yes, Bob.
CONWAY: Did you say we saved ninety white people?
GEORGE: Hurray for us. Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. They don't count.
CONWAY: Hurray for us. Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. They don't count.
GEORGE: You'd better try to get some sleep, Just you wait until I'm Foreign Secretary. Can't you just see me, Freshie, with all those other shrewd, little Foreign ( confidentially - screws up face )
CONWAY: Just you wait until I'm Foreign Secretary. Can't you just see me, Freshie, with all those other shrewd, little Foreign ( confidentially - screws up face )
GEORGE: You'd better not drink any more, Bob. You're not talking sense.
CONWAY: Don't worry, George. Nothing's going to happen. I'll fall right into line. I'll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be. I'll be the best little Foreign Secretary we ever had, just because I haven't the nerve to be anything Do try to sleep, Bob.
GEORGE: Do try to sleep, Bob.
CONWAY: Huh? Oh, sure, Freshie. Good thing, He grunts and squirms. George tucks him in.
CONWAY: Did you ever notice the sunrise in China, George? Ah, you should. It's beautiful.
BARNARD: Good morning, Lovey.
LOVETT: I beg your pardon.
BARNARD: I say, good morning, Lovey.
LOVETT: Good morning
BARNARD: I didn't care for 'sister' last night, and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.
LOVETT: I didn't care for 'sister' last night, and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.
BARNARD: I see.
LOVETT: I see.
BARNARD: Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
LOVETT: I'm never conversational before I coffee.
BARNARD: Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? Say, we're supposed to be travelling east, aren't we?
LOVETT: Why, of course. Yes.
BARNARD: Well, it looks to me as if we're travelling That's ridiculous.
LOVETT: That's ridiculous.
BARNARD: Is it?
LOVETT: It certainly is.
BARNARD: Look here
LOVETT: Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south
BARNARD: I always get it twisted because I'm Oh, really?
LOVETT: Oh, really?
BARNARD: Well, you just reverse it. Your left hand is
LOVETT: Well, you just reverse it. Your left hand is
BARNARD: Uh-huh. All I know is - the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from Now you're irritating and absurd!
LOVETT: Now you're irritating and absurd!
LOVETT: ( jumps up shrieking )
GEORGE: ( concerned for Conway )
LOVETT: I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!
GEORGE: Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.
LOVETT: ( not quite reassured )
BARNARD: He might have lost his way.
LOVETT: Of course. That's what I told them last night. You can't expect a man to sail around in the dark.[5]
GEORGE: All right, all right. Calm yourself. I'll talk to Fenner.
GEORGE: Fenner! I - I say
GEORGE: Bob! Bob!
GEORGE: Wake up! Something's happened! It isn't Fenner in the cockpit!
CONWAY: ( dismissing him with a gesture )
GEORGE: The bloke up there looks a Chinese, or a Mongolian, or something.
BARNARD: We're nowhere near Shanghai. We're going in the opposite direction.
CONWAY: We're over the desert. That's funny.
CONWAY: Charming chap.
BARNARD: ( not being funny )
CONWAY: Well, that's that, I guess.
BARNARD: Wonder what's happened to Fenner.
LOVETT: Yes. And who is he ? How'd he get there?
BARNARD: Do you suppose we stopped someplace during the night and changed pilots?
CONWAY: No. That's not possible! If we had landed, we all would have been awakened.
LOVETT: Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night ( with finality )
CONWAY: ( with finality )
LOVETT: What's he doing? Where's he taking us? He may be a maniac for all we know.
CONWAY: George, what are you going to do?
GEORGE: I'm going to drag him out and force him to tell us what his game is.
LOVETT: What if he refuses?
CONWAY: What if he refuses?
LOVETT: We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
CONWAY: ( a sweeping gesture )
CONWAY: ( takes wrench from George's hand )
CONWAY: I guess we're in for it.
LOVETT: In for what?
CONWAY: I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from ( starts for his seat )
LOVETT: You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
CONWAY: What do you suggest?
LOVETT: Why, you - you Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
CONWAY: It might afford you a great deal of ( sitting )
GEORGE: ( excited )
GEORGE: ( breathlessly )
INTERIOR PLANE: 57. MED. CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR Conway and George ready to get out. As Conway turns to open the door, he looks off and is startled by something he sees. George follows his gaze, and a bewildered expression comes into his eyes, too.
INTERIOR PLANE: 59. MEDIUM SHOT Conway and George both instinctively wheel around toward the opposite side. But from that direction too, a horde of natives dash toward them. Conway hesitates a second, and like a flash springs for the door. But he stops again, as he opens the door.
GEORGE: What are these people?
CONWAY: I don't know. I can't get the dialect.
GEORGE: Look - they're loading up with gasoline.
INTERIOR PLANE: 64. MEDIUM SHOT Conway is pacing. The occupants sit by their open windows.
CONWAY: Imagine having all that fuel there, waiting for us!
LOVETT: Where are we going? Huh?
BARNARD: ( pointing )
EXTERIOR SHOT: 65. LONG SHOT We see the plane against the sky. In the b.g., there is nothing but snow-covered DISSOLVE TO: INSERT: A sign reading "Shanghai Municipal INT. AIRPORT 66. MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT A Chinese officer is on the phone.
CHINESE OFFICER: A Douglas plane[6] from Baskul with Conway and four others aboard are missing. Unreported between here and Baskul.
HIGH OFFICIAL: ( holding forth to his secretary )
HIGH OFFICIAL: Good morning, gentlemen.
FUNCTIONARIES: ( ad-libbing )
OFFICIAL: No news yet, sir?
HIGH OFFICIAL: It's fantastic. The plane couldn't disappear into thin air.
ROBERTSON: Yes, sir?
HIGH OFFICIAL: Better get a postponement of the Far East conference. We can't afford to meet those nations without Conway.
BARNARD: It can't be kidnapping. They wouldn't be taking us so far on such a dangerous trip. No sense to it.
GEORGE: What do you make of it, Bob? You must have some idea?
CONWAY: Huh? I give it up. But this not knowing where you're going is exciting anyway.
LOVETT: Well, Mr. Conway, for a man who is supposed to be a leader, your do-nothing attitude is very disappointing.
GEORGE: What do you want him to do?
LOVETT: I don't know. I'm a paleontologist, not a Foreign Secretary.
CONWAY: Oh George, come on.
GEORGE: ( suddenly - tensely )
CONWAY: We got above that storm.
INTERIOR CABIN: 77. FULL SHOT Deathly silence. Gloria has her hands to her ears, rocking in pain. Suddenly her voice rents the air.
GLORIA: Oh! Oh! I can't stand it any longer!
GLORIA: ( screaming )
BARNARD: Take it easy, sister.
CONWAY: ( grabbing for it )
GLORIA: ( struggling )
CONWAY: Now, now. Come on now. That's right. Now, bite.
CONWAY: ( immediately on his feet )
BARNARD: Look! Look down there!
INTERIOR PLANE: 84. MEDIUM SHOT They are all silent - waiting prayerfully. Conway turns to the others - his voice electric with authority.
CONWAY: George - everybody - better get back towards the tail! He may nose her over. Into the corner, quick! George - cushions, They obey his command.
INTERIOR PLANE: 86. MED. CLOSE SHOT With Conway in front of them, the others are crouching in the corner. There are ad-libs of fearful assurances while they hand around cushions and blankets.
INTERIOR PLANE: 88. MED. CLOSE SHOT The occupants brace themselves for the jolt. The ship hits and bounces several times and finally stops. Its nose seems to bury itself in the ground. The people are lifted high into the air where they remain, suspended for a few seconds, terror-stricken. Then, accompanied by grinding, crackling sounds, the ship flops back and falls on its side. For a moment there is stark silence - while the people do not stir. A look of relief spreads over their faces.
CONWAY: Everybody all right?
GEORGE: What is it? Has he fainted?
CONWAY: It looks like it.
CONWAY: ( handing gun to George )
CONWAY: He's dead.
GEORGE: George stares unbelievingly.
CONWAY: It must have happened the moment he hit the ground.
GEORGE: What is it?
CONWAY: See that spot?
GEORGE: That's where we were this morning. He had it marked. Right on the border of Tibet. Here's where civilization ends. We must be a thousand miles beyond it - just a blank on the map.
CONWAY: That's where we were this morning. He had it marked. Right on the border of Tibet. Here's where civilization ends. We must be a thousand miles beyond it - just a blank on the map.
GEORGE: ( afraid to ask )
CONWAY: It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached.
CONWAY: George, our chances of getting out of this are pretty slim. But it's up to ( a nod toward cabin )
CONWAY: ( interrupting - cheerily )
CONWAY: Probably a heart attack.
BARNARD: What are we going to do?
CONWAY: Well, there's nothing we can do until the morning.
CONWAY: The storm will probably die down by then. My suggestion is that we better all try and get a good night's rest.
GEORGE: ( fiercely )
GEORGE: Why don't you tell them we're a million miles from civilization, without a chance of getting out of here alive? It's slow starvation - that's what it is. It's a slow, horrible death!
GLORIA: Well, that's perfect! Just perfect! What a kick I'm going to get out of She emits another outburst of semi-hysterical 98. CLOSE SHOT - GROUP Favoring Gloria. The bitterness of a lifetime in her voice.
GLORIA: ( grimly satisfied )
FADE IN: 101. LONG SHOT Shooting toward the mountains which seem to imprison the valley below. The snowstorm, treacherous in its fury, seems to threaten the valley with complete 102. MEDIUM SHOT Of the plane, tilted over on its side. It is fully covered with snow. CAMERA PANS UP TO LOVETT AND BARNARD, shivering in their blankets as they pace worriedly.
LOVETT: They've been gone for three hours.
LOVETT: Left us here to rot. That's what they've done. Heroes of the newspapers!
BARNARD: All right, all right. Keep quiet.
PLANE: George and Conway are seen walking briskly toward the plane, their few clothes a scant protection against the biting INTERIOR PLANE 105. FULL SHOT Here they come!
INTERIOR PLANE: 105. FULL SHOT Here they come!
LOVETT: Here they come!
GEORGE: Hello, everybody.
GEORGE: Well, we found some food.
GEORGE: No chance of our starving now.
LOVETT: What is it?
GEORGE: Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here, have some. I've read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff.
GEORGE: Listen, my brother and I have worked out a plan. If we use our heads, we should be able to keep alive for weeks, until he gets back.
GEORGE: He doesn't know. But he's starting out right away in the direction of India. Sooner or later he's bound to run into somebody - a tribe or something.
BARNARD: 106. CLOSE SHOT - CONWAY Throughout the previous scene he has been busily occupied making preparations. Out of the baggage hold he has brought some blankets and rope and has been wrapping his feet in them. As George speaks, he looks up and smiles.
GEORGE: Now here's the idea. We found a cave over by that small hill. After we bury the pilot, we're moving in. We can have a fire there. I shouldn't be surprised to see Bob back within a week.
GLORIA: You haven't got a Chinaman's chance[8] of getting out of this country alive, and you know it.
BARNARD: Cave, eh? Where?
GEORGE: ( pointing )
BARNARD: Hey - look!
GEORGE: Look, Bob!
INTERIOR PLANE: 111. MEDIUM SHOT Conway takes in the unbelievable sight. We hear the exultant exclamations of the others. Barnard and Lovett start out of the plane.
LOVETT: ( looking around )
BARNARD: Do you think they're cannibals?
LOVETT: Do you think they're cannibals?
CHANG: I am from a nearby Lamasery.
GEORGE: Why, he's speaking English.
LOVETT: ( shaking hands )
CONWAY: ( shaking hands )
CHANG: How do you do?
CONWAY: You've no idea, sir, how unexpected and very welcome you are. My friends and I - and the lady in the plane - left Baskul night before last for Shanghai, but we suddenly found ourselves travelling in the opposite direction
LOVETT: At the mercy of a mad pilot.
CONWAY: We'd be eternally grateful if you
CHANG: ( interrupting )
CONWAY: He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead.
GEORGE: We were just going to bury him when you came along.
CHANG: ( preoccupied )
CONWAY: ( when Chang is through )
CHANG: I shall consider it an honor to accompany you and your friends.
CHANG: You will need suitable clothes for the journey. It is not particularly far, but quite difficult.
CONWAY: Thank you.
GLORIA: As they cling against the rocky sides and glance apprehensively down into the abyss below.
CHANG: Welcome to Shangri-La.
CHANG: ( a wave of his hand )
LOVETT: It's magic!
GEORGE'S VOICE: Come along, Bob. Coming, Bob?
LOVETT: Mr. Barnard, I do not like this place. I definitely do not like this place.
BARNARD: Will you stop squawking!
LOVETT: Look at me. Look at what they gave me to wear.
BARNARD: You never looked better in your life. As soon as our clothes are cleaned, they're going to give them back to us, They have reached the doorway of the dining room and halt. Two servants bow and scrape and lead them in.
BARNARD: Something tells me this means food. Come on!
LOVETT: I just feel as though I'm being made ready for the executioner.
BARNARD: ( taking in the food )
LOVETT: That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
BARNARD: Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
LOVETT: Please don't call me Lovey.
CONWAY: That was refreshing! Oh, ho - the food looks good!
BARNARD: Some layout they got here. Did you get a load of the rooms? You couldn't do better at the Ritz.
LOVETT: All the conveniences for the condemned, if you ask me.
BARNARD: Don't mind Lovey. He's got the misery.
LOVETT: Mr. Conway, I don't like this place. I don't like it. It's too mysterious.
CONWAY: It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?
BARNARD: I'll say.
CHANG: Is there something I can do for you?
GLORIA: What do you want?
CHANG: I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-
GLORIA: You get out of here! If any of you men think you can come busting in here-
CHANG: Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do.
GLORIA: ( through fits of coughing )
CHANG: I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
GLORIA: ( looks up quickly )
CHANG: Please let me help you.
GLORIA: Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!
CHANG: ( quietly )
GLORIA: ( her voice cracking )
CHANG: ( before turning away )
CHANG: ( jovially )
CHANG: ( sees that no one has started )
BARNARD: Where's the girl? Miss Stone.
CHANG: She's remaining in her room. She isn't feeling very well.
BARNARD: Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal!
CHANG: Thank you.
CONWAY: And the wine - excellent.
CHANG: I'm glad you like it. It's made right here in the valley.
LOVETT: Now that dinner is over, if you'll excuse us, we're very anxious to discuss ways and means of getting back home.
GEORGE: The first thing we want to do is to cable the Foreign Office. All of England is waiting to hear about my brother. There's a cruiser at Shanghai ready to take him back.
CHANG: Really? Well, as regards cabling, I'm afraid I can't help. Unfortunately, we have no wireless here. As a matter of fact, we have no means of communication with the outside world.
BARNARD: Not even a radio?
CHANG: It's always been a source of deep regret, but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible.
GEORGE: In that event, we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately. Some means to get us back to civilization.
CHANG: Are you so certain you are away from As far away as I ever want to be.
GEORGE: As far away as I ever want to be.
CHANG: Oh, dear.
LOVETT: Of course, the porters will be very well paid - that is, within reason.
CHANG: I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
LOVETT: No porters here!!
CHANG: What about those men we met this morning?
BARNARD: What about those men we met this morning?
CHANG: Yes. Those are our own people. They never venture beyond the point where you were met this morning. It is much too hazardous.
BARNARD: How do you account for all this? Who brought it in?
CHANG: Oh, yes. There is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here. That is our only contact with the outside world. Every now and again, depending upon favorable weather of course, they make the journey.
GEORGE: How can we get in touch with them?
CHANG: In that respect, you are exceedingly fortunate. We are expecting a shipment from them almost any time now
LOVETT: What exactly do you mean by "almost any time now"?
CHANG: Well, we've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.
BARNARD: Two years!?
CHANG: Barnard and Lovett look shocked. George starts to say something, but the words choke in his throat.
CHANG: But I can assure you, gentlemen, if there is a prolonged delay, Shangri-La will endeavor to make your stay as pleasant as possible.
CHANG: Good night, Mr. Conway.
CONWAY: Good night, sir.
LOVETT: That's what I mean - mysterious. Mr. Conway, I don't like that man. He's too vague.
GEORGE: ( concerned )
CONWAY: It seems to me we should be grateful. We were in a bad mess this morning.
BARNARD: That's what I say. What do you say to a rubber of bridge? I saw some cards in the other room.
CONWAY: Not for me, thanks. No, I'm too weary.
BARNARD: ( slightly effeminate )
LOVETT: ( distractedly )
BARNARD: Thinking? What about some double solitaire?
LOVETT: As a matter of fact, I'm very good at double solitaire.
BARNARD: No kidding?
LOVETT: Then I'm your man.
BARNARD: Then I'm your man.
CONWAY: Hello, George.
GEORGE: ( lights the cigarette - after a pause )
CONWAY: We've had plenty of it the last few ? 512 ? It's far from over, from what I can see. This place gives me the creeps, hidden away like this - no contact with civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned at all.
GEORGE: It's far from over, from what I can see. This place gives me the creeps, hidden away like this - no contact with civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned at all.
CONWAY: Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.
GEORGE: You talk as though you intend on staying.
CONWAY: ( turns to him )
GEORGE: What are you talking about?
CONWAY: ( back to earth )
GEORGE: You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill.
CONWAY: Don't you ever want to see what's on the other side of the hill?
GEORGE: What could there be except just another hill? In any event, I'm not curious. At the moment, it seems to me we should be concerned about getting home. I'd give anything to be in London right Of course you would. If ever we get out of this place, the thing for you to do is to take that job with Helen's What do you mean if we should get out?
CONWAY: Of course you would. If ever we get out of this place, the thing for you to do is to take that job with Helen's What do you mean if we should get out?
GEORGE: What do you mean if we should get out?
CONWAY: ( evasively )
GEORGE: ( interrupting )
CONWAY: Well - I mean
GEORGE: What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
CONWAY: George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?
GEORGE: ( catching on )
CONWAY: There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
GEORGE: There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
CONWAY: That's what's on the other side of the FADE OUT: FADE IN EXT. OF VALLEY - DAY 154. LONG SHOT FROM A TOWER ROOM Shooting over shoulders of two men in We see a beautiful picture of the valley below. There is a tranquility here that is beatific. CAMERA PULLS BACK. The two men are revealed as Conway and Chang. They stand on a terrace of one of the tower rooms.
FADE IN: EXT. OF VALLEY - DAY 154. LONG SHOT FROM A TOWER ROOM Shooting over shoulders of two men in We see a beautiful picture of the valley below. There is a tranquility here that is beatific. CAMERA PULLS BACK. The two men are revealed as Conway and Chang. They stand on a terrace of one of the tower rooms.
CHANG: It's three thousand feet, practically straight down to the floor of the valley. The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it. There are over two thousand people in the Valley besides those here in Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
CONWAY: Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
CHANG: Goodness, no!
CHANG: So there are others?
CHANG: Oh, yes.
CONWAY: Who, for instance?
CHANG: In time you will meet them all.
CONWAY: He watches Chang's face searchingly, then smiles.
CONWAY: For a man who talks a great deal, it's amazing how unenlightening you can be.
CHANG: ( laughs )
CONWAY: You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
CHANG: ( evasively )
IN ALCOVE: She sits, a tapestry board on her lap, watching George with keen interest.
MARIA: Good afternoon.
GEORGE: ( starts backing out )
MARIA: ( appealingly )
MARIA: Tea will be served any moment.
MARIA: ( a winning smile )
MARIA: My name is Maria. Won't you sit down?
CONWAY: By the way, what religion do you follow We follow many.
CHANG: We follow many.
CHANG: ( thoughtfully )
CONWAY: That's intelligent.
CHANG: We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.
CONWAY: How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?
CHANG: Oh, good heavens, no!
CONWAY: How do you deal with incorrigibles? Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal? Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.
CHANG: Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal? Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.
CONWAY: You have no disputes over women?
CHANG: Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
CONWAY: Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?
CHANG: ( smiling )
CONWAY: That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
CONWAY: That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
CHANG: You'd be surprised, my dear Conway, how a little courtesy all around helps to smooth out the most complicated problems.
CHANG: At some time in the future you will have the pleasure of meeting her.
CONWAY: Some man had better get ready to be very courteous to me.
CONWAY: But Mr. Chang, all these things - books, instruments, sculpture - do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters?
CHANG: They were.
CONWAY: Well, it must have taken
CHANG: Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?
CONWAY: Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?
CHANG: Of course we have no money as you know it. We do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes because, well, because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it.
CONWAY: That would suit me perfectly. I'm always broke. How did you pay for them?
CHANG: Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . .
CONWAY: buy and sell?
CHANG: Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange
CONWAY: ( chuckling )
CHANG: That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
CONWAY: A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father When was all this?

CONWAY: When was all this?
CHANG: Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
CONWAY: ( shocked )
CHANG: Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without Well, they didn't actually mean that.
CONWAY: Well, they didn't actually mean that.
CHANG: Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.
CONWAY: Well, is it?
CHANG: Rather astonishingly so, yes. And particularly so in the case of Father Perrault himself. Do you know when he and the natives were finished building Shangri-La, he was 108 years old and still very active, in spite of only having one leg?
CONWAY: 108 and still active?
CHANG: You're startled?
CONWAY: Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death?" or, "This thing or that killed Very often.
CHANG: Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death?" or, "This thing or that killed Very often.
CONWAY: Very often.
CHANG: And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
CONWAY: ( after a pause )
CHANG: Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
CONWAY: I surprise you? Now that's news.
CHANG: I mean, your amazement. I could have understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it?
CONWAY: Mr. Chang, if you don't mind, I think I'll go on being amazed - in moderation, of course.
CHANG: ( chuckles )
BARNARD: Honey, it's terrific! Terrific! I just saw something that will make your hair stand on end. You see those hills over there? Gold! Gold! Popping right out of them! Tons of it!
BARNARD: Aw say, honey, you aren't feeling well, are you? Look, don't pay too much attention to what those doctors tell you. I've seen an awful lot of people fool them, and I've got a hunch that this place is going to be good for you. Honest, I have.
CONWAY: ( cheerily )
MEN: Good morning, Mr. Conway!
CONWAY: Oh, you speak English, do you?
MEN: Yes, sir.
CONWAY: No, thanks. Not just now.
CONWAY: ( instantly changing his mind )
BARNARD: Bah! Fossils! Why? What for? Running around digging up a lot of old bones! You didn't dig yourself out of one of those holes by any chance, did you?
GEORGE: ( forces a smile )
CONWAY: Well - I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners.
GEORGE: Nothing about the porters yet?
CONWAY: Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
GEORGE: Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
CONWAY: Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
GEORGE: I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.
CONWAY: They have reached the door and start into dining room.
BARNARD: Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm ( imitating Chang as he takes his chair )
CONWAY: ( imitating Chang as he takes his chair )
GLORIA: Good evening.
BARNARD: Well, I'm certainly glad to see that it's all finally organized.
BARNARD: Hey, what's happened to you?
GLORIA: ( self-consciously )
BARNARD: Why, you look beautiful.
CONWAY: That's unkind. Doesn't Miss Stone always look beautiful?
BARNARD: ( suddenly )
BARNARD: And say, honey, you look a million per cent better. Wholesome, kind of - and clean. You take a tip from me, and don't you ever put that stuff on your face again. Why, it's like hiding behind a mask.
LOVETT: Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
BARNARD: Have I?
LOVETT: It's very strange, you know. You've never told us anything about yourself. Who are you, anyway? Why don't you take your mask off for once!
CONWAY: ( lightly )
BARNARD: ( his face has become serious )
LOVETT: Certainly not.
BARNARD: Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
LOVETT: ( skeptical )
BARNARD: ( after another pause )
CONWAY: ( the first one to make the connection )
BARNARD: Bryant's Utilities - that's me.
LOVETT: I knew it. I knew I had a reason for hating you! Sir, you're a thief.
GLORIA: He never stole anything from you , did I have 500 shares of Bryant Utilities that I bought with money that I saved for 20 years teaching school, and now I couldn't sell it for postage stamps.
LOVETT: I have 500 shares of Bryant Utilities that I bought with money that I saved for 20 years teaching school, and now I couldn't sell it for postage stamps.
BARNARD: That's too bad. I got a half million shares. My whole foundation! And now look at me!
LOVETT: A colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people
BARNARD: You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed[12] plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had.
LOVETT: You are a thief, sir, and a swindler, and I, for one, will be only too glad to turn you over to the police when we get back.
GEORGE: ( suddenly - hoarsely )
GEORGE: What makes you think we're ever going to get back? You may not know it, but you're all prisoners here. We were deliberately kidnapped and brought here - and nobody knows why
GEORGE: Well, I'm not content to be a prisoner. I'm going to find out when we're going to get out of this place.
CONWAY: ( calling )
GEORGE: Chang! Chang!
GEORGE: ( shaking servant violently )
CONWAY: George, what do you think you're doing?
GEORGE: Let me go, Bob!
CONWAY: George, come back!
GEORGE: Chang! Chang! Chang!
GEORGE: Come here, you! Come here!
CONWAY: George, you idiot!
BARNARD: Had to sock him, eh?
GEORGE: Let me up! Let me up!
CONWAY: All right. Sorry, George.
BARNARD: Say Conway, is it true about us being Conway shrugs.
BARNARD: ( louder )
CONWAY: Mr. Chang!
CONWAY: Do you mind stepping in here for a moment?
CONWAY: Won't you sit down?
CONWAY: ( very quietly )
GLORIA: As Conway's voice continues, talking to Chang:
CONWAY: Personally, I don't mind at all. I'm enjoying every minute of it.
CONWAY: We want to know why we were kidnapped, why we are being kept here, but most important of all - do we get the porters, and when?
CHANG: ( after a pause )
LOVETT: The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!
BARNARD: Yeah. I though you ran this joint.
CONWAY: Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we get the porters?
CHANG: The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come.
GEORGE: Don't believe him, Bob. He's just trying to get out.
LOVETT: Sounds like a stall to me.
BARNARD: Sounds like a stall to me.
CONWAY: One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
CHANG: The only one.
CONWAY: And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
CHANG: The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Well, then he's the man I want to see.
CONWAY: Well, then he's the man I want to see.
CONWAY: Better wait here until I get back. We'll soon know where we stand.
HIGH LAMA: Please come in.
HIGH LAMA: Sit here, near me. I am an old man and can do no one any harm.
CONWAY: Are you the High Lama?
HIGH LAMA: 217. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO As Conway, expressionless, sits down opposite the High Lama.
HIGH LAMA: I trust you have been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival.
CONWAY: Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as
CONWAY: ( awe and amazement )
HIGH LAMA: What is it, my son?
CONWAY: You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago
HIGH LAMA: Sit down, my son.
HIGH LAMA: Oh, not of Conway the empire-builder and public hero. I wanted to meet the Conway who in one of his books, said, "There are moments in every man's life when he glimpses the eternal."
HIGH LAMA: That Conway seemed to belong here. In fact, it was suggested that someone be sent to bring him here.
CONWAY: That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?
HIGH LAMA: Sondra Bizet.
CONWAY: ( secretly pleased )
HIGH LAMA: Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all.
CONWAY: Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?
HIGH LAMA: We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri-La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on.
CONWAY: But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and HIGH LAMA We have reason. It is the entire meaning and purpose of Shangri-La. It came to me in a vision, long, long, ago. I saw all the nations strengthening, not in wisdom, but in the vulgar passions and the will to destroy. I saw their machine power multiply until a single weaponed man might match a whole army. I foresaw a time when man, exulting in the technique of murder, would rage so hotly over the world that every book, every treasure, would be doomed to destruction. This vision was so vivid and so moving that I determined to gather together all the things of beauty and culture that I could and preserve them here against the doom toward which the world is rushing.

CHAMBERS: Conway comes through. He walks as if in a trance. CAMERA PULLS BACK as he continues on his way - bearing an expression of deep absorption.
GEORGE: What about the porters?
CONWAY: ( vaguely )
GEORGE: Didn't you find out anything about the ? 534 ? Why - I'm sorry - but I
CONWAY: Why - I'm sorry - but I
GEORGE: For heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter with you? You went out there for the purpose of
CONWAY: George. George - do you mind? I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight.
CONWAY: Do you mind?
SONDRA: This is Mr. Conway, children.
CHILDREN: ( all together - sing-song )
CONWAY: How do you do?
CHILDREN: Very well, thank you.
SONDRA: All right, children. We will now sing
SONDRA: Do you mind?
CONWAY: Not at all.
SONDRA: Thank you.
CONWAY: All right, children. Now teacher is going to be very busy this afternoon, so school's dismissed!
CONWAY: Oh, please. I hope you're not going to run away this time.
SONDRA: ( extending her hand )
CONWAY: I hope you'll forgive me for
CONWAY: ( looking around )
SONDRA: Oh, you mean my pigeons.
SONDRA: ( showing him )
SONDRA: You see, this is how we tie them on. And by varying the size of the flutes, I can get any notes I wish. The wind does the rest. Here's a little fellow who lost his!
CONWAY: ( wonderingly )
SONDRA: Yes. Hold this pigeon.
CONWAY: You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
SONDRA: That was easy. I read your books.
CONWAY: Oh, you've read my books. You do more things! What have my books got to do with it?
SONDRA: I saw a man whose life was empty.
CONWAY: A man whose life was empty!
SONDRA: Oh, I know. It was full of this and full of that. But you were accomplishing nothing. You were going nowhere, and you knew it.
SONDRA: As a matter of fact, all I saw was a little boy whistling in the dark.
CONWAY: A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man whose life is empty?
SONDRA: ( after a pause )
CONWAY: ( good-naturedly )
SONDRA: I really only brought you here to show you my pigeons!
CONWAY: Don't worry about the pigeons. From now on, you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet!
CONWAY: There are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin.
SONDRA: I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
CONWAY: Thank you.
SONDRA: Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
CONWAY: Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.
SONDRA: Yes, I know.
CONWAY: Father Perrault. Of course I can't quite get used to this age thing.
SONDRA: ( satisfying his obvious curiosity )
CONWAY: Oh, you're going to make life very simple.
CONWAY: ( wonderingly )
SONDRA: What is?
CONWAY: All of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent history. This place, hidden away from the rest of the world, with its glorious concepts, and now you come along and confuse me entirely.
SONDRA: I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
CONWAY: On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri-La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here.
SONDRA: I'm so glad.
CONWAY: I can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow familiar. The very air that I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley, while its head explores the eternal. All the beautiful things I see, these cherry blossoms, you - all somehow familiar.
SONDRA: Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
CONWAY: I wonder.
SONDRA: I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
CONWAY: Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for She laughs as they exit scene.
LOVETT: I don't know why I associate with you, Mr. Barnard - or Mr. Chalmers Bryant - or Mr. Embezzler - or whatever your name may be.

BARNARD: Okay, Lovey.

BARNARD: They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.

BARNARD: Okay, honey, all I want is a glass of wine! Thanks very much.
NATIVE GIRL: Please sit down.

LOVETT: Mr. Barnard?
BARNARD: Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked for a glass of wine and look what I got. Come on, sit down.

SONDRA: ( chuckling )
CONWAY: You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
SONDRA: Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
CONWAY: It's not so bad, really. Some phases are a little sordid, of course. That's only to be expected.
SONDRA: Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.
CONWAY: Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.
SONDRA: Struggling, why?
CONWAY: Well, everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on.
SONDRA: You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.
CONWAY: You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.
SONDRA: I was just going to.
CONWAY: It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?
SONDRA: ( joining in )
CONWAY: Because mother read it in a book somewhere, and if mother's little darling doesn't take her fingers out of the salad bowl this instant, mother's going to wring her little neck.
SONDRA: ( teasingly )
CONWAY: I'd love it!
SONDRA: Conway makes a grab for her and she spurts away. He chases her across part of the garden, and past the fountain catches up with her. He reaches to place his hands around her neck.

LOVETT: Amazing, Mr. Chang. This place is amazing! And that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. Oh, I've looked around. I've seen everything. Your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy.

LOVETT: You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]
CHANG: You've very kind Mr. Lovett.
LOVETT: I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due.
CHANG: Oh, I'm so glad.
LOVETT: Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self-inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, "Lovey"
CHANG: Why, no.
LOVETT: "Ungrateful fool . . . !" Those were my very words to myself last night. "Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation."
CHANG: Now, what would you like to do?
LOVETT: Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your permission of course, and while I'm waiting for these porters, I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.
CHANG: Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.
LOVETT: Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.

BARNARD: You see? You get the idea? From this reservoir here I can pipe in the whole works. Oh, I'm going to get a great kick out of this. Of course it's just to keep my hand in, but with the equipment we have here, I can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there. Can rig it up in no time.
CONWAY: ( a twinkle in his eye )

CHANG: Come in, my dear.
MARIA: Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.
CHANG: Charming, isn't she?
CONWAY: Yes, charming.
CHANG: Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
CONWAY: Why not? She's an attractive young woman.
CHANG: Young? She arrived here in 1888. She was 20 at the time. She was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains. The whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people.
CONWAY: ( hands in the air )
CHANG: Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
CONWAY: Suppose she should leave it?
CHANG: Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
CONWAY: No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.
CHANG: Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.
CONWAY: ( shaking his head )
CHANG: Age is a limit we impose upon ourselves. You know, each time you Westerners celebrate your birthday, you build another fence around your minds.
GEORGE: ( stridently )
GEORGE: A fine trick! Smart, aren't you? What a pack of lies you told us about those porters! Of course the minute they arrive, we can make arrangements to leave. If they take us. But you knew very well you'd tell them not to!
CHANG: Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't
GEORGE: ( snapping at him )
CHANG: You must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey. He could never get through that country alive.
CONWAY: ( tensely )
LAMA: Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.
CONWAY: I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
LAMA: You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
CONWAY: Because, my son, I am placing in your hands the future and destiny of Shangri-La.
LAMA: Because, my son, I am placing in your hands the future and destiny of Shangri-La.
LAMA: I knew my work was done when I first set eyes upon you.
LAMA: I have waited for you, my son, for a long time. I have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that I might find you . My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath, for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while the storm rages without.
CONWAY: Do you think this will come in my time?
HIGH LAMA: You, my son, will live through the storm. You will preserve the fragrance of our history, and add to it a touch of your own mind. Beyond that, my vision weakens.
BARNARD: Look, honey. We run the pipes through here, and we connect with the main water line here.
GLORIA: Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
BARNARD: Oh, that's a cinch. I'll show them how to cast pipes out of clay.
GEORGE: There you are! Barnard, you'd better get your things together. We're leaving.
BARNARD: Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come When are you going to start?
GEORGE: Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come When are you going to start?
BARNARD: When are you going to start?
GEORGE: Right this very minute! The porters are waiting for us on the plateau. And that Chinaman thought he could stop me. Come along.
BARNARD: I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip.
GEORGE: You mean you don't want to go?
BARNARD: Well - I'm
GEORGE: I see. You're afraid of going to jail, Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing ( to Gloria )
BARNARD: Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing ( to Gloria )
GEORGE: All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing ( to Gloria )
BARNARD: Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey.
GLORIA: ( beaming )
BARNARD: Sure - sure. Don't you worry. I'll take care of you.
GEORGE: All right, suit yourself. But just remember you had your chance.
GEORGE: How about you? Do you want to go?
LOVETT: Go? Where?
GEORGE: Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
LOVETT: Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
GEORGE: ( irritably )
LOVETT: Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
GEORGE: ( grumbling as he goes )
LOVETT: ( glowering after him )
BARNARD: Lovett immediately dismisses George from his mind and his face brightening, he starts toward Barnard and Gloria.
LOVETT: Hello, Gloria.
GLORIA: Barney, I've just finished translating one of the most interesting old tablets you can imagine. It told me all about the origin of the Masonic symbols and
LOVETT: Barney, I've just finished translating one of the most interesting old tablets you can imagine. It told me all about the origin of the Masonic symbols and
BARNARD: That's swell, Lovey. I want to show you something. Look!
LOVETT: Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it?
BARNARD: Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village
GEORGE: ( softly )
CONWAY: ( a murmur )
GEORGE: Well, you can stop worrying about everything now, Bob. I've made arrangements to leave. If you'll let me close that window, I can talk to you. That noise is driving me crazy.
GEORGE: I said we're getting out of here. Back to civilization. I made a deal with the porters. They brought in a load of books or something, and they're leaving tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for us five miles outside the valley. Come on, get your things together. Where's your top coat?
CONWAY: You can't leave, George.
GEORGE: Why not? What's going to stop me?
CONWAY: ( pleading )
GEORGE: ( sharply )
CONWAY: ( impulsively )
GEORGE: I don't know what you're talking about. You're carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up. If you'll only tell me about it.
CONWAY: I will, George. I want to tell you. I'll burst with it if I don't. It's weird and fantastical and sometimes unbelievable, but so beautiful!
CONWAY: . . . And that's the whole story, George. He died as peacefully as the passing of a cloud's shadow. His last words to me were, "I place in your hands, my son, the future and destiny of Shangri-La." Now you know why I can't leave.
GEORGE: ( running his hand through his hair )
CONWAY: So you think I'm mad?
GEORGE: What else can I think after a tale like that? Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
CONWAY: So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
GEORGE: I think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet? How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof?
CONWAY: I don't need any proof.
GEORGE: ( contemptuously )
CONWAY: Is that all my story meant to you?
GEORGE: What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
CONWAY: Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.
GEORGE: It's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
CONWAY: Please, George. I don't want to talk about it anymore.
GEORGE: You've got to talk about it. What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility.
CONWAY: I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
GEORGE: ( suddenly )
CONWAY: Enough! Never mind the girl!
GEORGE: Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember, you've looked after me. Now I think you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something wrong with you, let me help you.
CONWAY: ( a murmur )
GEORGE: Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
CONWAY: George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
GEORGE: I'd go mad!
CONWAY: ( after a moment's hesitation )
GEORGE: ( after a long pause )
CONWAY: ( just as George reaches the door )
GEORGE: ( turning back )
CONWAY: ( glances up - surprised )
GEORGE: Yes, the little Russian girl.
CONWAY: What's she got to do with it?
GEORGE: She's going with me.
CONWAY: ( suddenly - wild )
CONWAY: ( wheeling )
GEORGE: ( confidently )
CONWAY: ( strongly )
GEORGE: ( slowly )
CONWAY: She came here in 1888!
GEORGE: This would be funny - if it wasn't so pathetic. Why, she isn't a day over ? 561 ? You're wrong, George.
CONWAY: You're wrong, George.
GEORGE: I'm not wrong. She told me so. Besides, she wouldn't have to tell me. I'd know ( significantly )
GEORGE: ( cynically )
CONWAY: ( doesn't want to believe it )
GEORGE: All right. I'll prove it to you! You believe everything they've told you - without proof! I'll prove my story!
GEORGE: Come in a minute.
GEORGE: Come in.
GEORGE: ( shrewdly )
MARIA: ( small, frightened voice )
MARIA: But you promised me! You promised to take me with you!
MARIA: It's all your fault! It was all arranged until he spoke to you! Why can't you leave us alone?
CONWAY: Do you mean to tell me you want to leave I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone.
MARIA: I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone.
CONWAY: I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone.
MARIA: The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
CONWAY: Father Perrault is dead.
MARIA: He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him!
CONWAY: ( quietly )
MARIA: Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't ? 563 ? I thought so! He tells everyone I'm old. He wants them to stay away from me. He can't stand it when anyone comes near. He's punished me for every minute I've spent with George. If it weren't for him, I would have been out of here long ago, but he always stops me. Six months ago, I tried to escape and he locked me in a dark room. I nearly went ( pause )

GEORGE: She was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were, Bob.
CONWAY: ( thrown )
CONWAY: You're lying, aren't you?
MARIA: No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What reason could I have for lying? The chances are that we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive, but I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now.
CONWAY: ( dead voice )
GEORGE: The clothes?
CONWAY: The clothes?
GEORGE: ( alertly )
CONWAY: What about the others?
GEORGE: I've already asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them.
CONWAY: ( business-like )
MARIA: Are you taking me?
CONWAY: Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!
GEORGE: It won't be long now before we're in London. Can't you just see everyone when we pop out of the blue!
GEORGE: We'll have them breathless when they hear our story.
GEORGE'S VOICE: You had me worried for a while. I thought you were gone completely.
GEORGE: ( sincerely - grinning )
CONWAY: What was that?
GEORGE: I was saying
CONWAY: Can't you shut up? Must you go on babbling like an idiot?
SONDRA: What's happened? Where's Bob?
CHANG: He's going, my child.
SONDRA: But he will return.
CHANG: But he will return.
SONDRA: Oh no! No! Bob!
307. DAY: The whole caravan are seen in the distance, clambering up a mountain-side - hoisted by ropes.
308. NIGHT: In the middle of a vast plain. They attempt to put up tents, which proves futile, as a raging snowstorm rips the canvas from its moorings.
309. DAY: The large group are seen lowering themselves in single file down a ledge alongside a ravine. The wind howls.
310. DAY: A mountain pass somewhere with a hailstorm swiping viciously across their faces. They edge their way pre-cautiously across a narrow ledge. Suddenly the girl loses her bearings - slips - screams - and is caught by Conway just in time to save her from falling down the side of the jagged mountain.
MARIA: ( collapsing )
MARIA: ( hysterical )
GEORGE: Bob, can't you get them to wait for us? They're leaving us farther behind every day.
CONWAY: There's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us, but we must go on.
MARIA: No, I can't! I can't! You've got to let me rest! You've got to let me rest!
CONWAY: ( calling out to the porters )
GEORGE: ( contemptuously )
CONWAY: ( wryly )
GEORGE: ( a frightened whisper )
CONWAY: George! George!
332. DAWN: As the sun comes up, Conway emerges from the whiteness, feeling his way forward with a walking stick. He walks with the pain and effort of a blind man, and just as he manages to cross a bridge spanning a great chasm, the bridge collapses. He stumbles on.
333. DAY: Conway, looking haggard and more dead than alive, stumbles out onto more dry and level terrain. He collapses to the EXT. NATIVE VILLAGE - DAY 334. MEDIUM SHOT A group of Chinese in front of huts. They look up, see something off and commence shouting excitedly in their native tongue.
FADE IN: INT. FOREIGN OFFICE 337. FULL SHOT - OUTER SECTION CAMERA MOVES FORWARD passing a series of desks and clerks until it reaches a clerk who is opening several cablegrams. Finally he comes to one which causes his eyes to pop. Muttering something under his breath which sounds like "Good heavens!" - and without taking his eyes off the cablegram, he rises and starts 338. MED. TRUCKING SHOT - CLERK As he strides across to the end of the outer office - to a glass-panelled door upon which we read "ASSISTANT TO THE FOREIGN SECRETARY" - through which he INT. OFFICE OF ASSISTANT 339. FULL SHOT As the clerk enters, full of excitement.
CLERK: Cable from Gainsford.
ASSISTANT SECRETARY: Oh, read it!
CLERK: ( reading )
ASSISTANT SECRETARY: All right, give it to the press.
CLERK: All of it?
ASSISTANT SECRETARY: Yes. Might as well - all of it.
CLERK: Yes, sir.
ASSISTANT SECRETARY: I'll dispatch a convoy to meet him.
FADE IN: INT. OFFICE OF ASSISTANT 341. FULL SHOT Another clerk enters with haste, bearing another cablegram.
CLERK: Conway's gone again! Run out! Listen to this! From Gainsford.
ASSISTANT SECRETARY: Let me have it.
FADE IN: INT. A GRILL ROOM OF A FASHIONABLE CLUB 343. FULL SHOT A scattering of men are present - some at the bar - others at tables.
CARSTAIRS: ( looking off )
MEEKER: Will you have a drink? Sit down.
GAINSFORD: Yes. Scotch and soda. I'm parched.
ROBERTSON: Here you are, ready and waiting.
CARSTAIRS: We're most eager to know what you've Any news of Conway?
GAINSFORD: ( setting glass down )
MEEKER: Do you mean to tell me you never caught up with him?
GAINSFORD: Since that night that he jumped off the ship until two weeks ago, I've been missing him by inches.
WYNANT: You don't mean it!
ROBERTSON: He was as determined as that to get Determined! Gentlemen, in the whole course of my life, I have never encountered anything so grim. During these last ten months, that man has done the most astounding things. He learned how to fly, stole an army plane and got caught, put into jail, escaped . . . all in an amazingly short space of time. But this was only the beginning of his adventures.
GAINSFORD: Determined! Gentlemen, in the whole course of my life, I have never encountered anything so grim. During these last ten months, that man has done the most astounding things. He learned how to fly, stole an army plane and got caught, put into jail, escaped . . . all in an amazingly short space of time. But this was only the beginning of his adventures.
GAINSFORD: Of course he had already gone. But his memory - ah - his memory will live with those natives for the rest of their lives. The Man Who Was Not Human, they called him. They'll never forget the devil-eyed stranger who six times tried to go over a mountain pass where no other human being dared to travel, and six times was forced back by the severest storms. They'll never forget the madman who stole their food and clothing - whom they locked up in their barracks - but who fought six of their guards to escape.
GAINSFORD: Why, their soldiers are still talking about their pursuit to overtake him, and shuddering at the memory. He led them the wildest chase through their own country, and finally he disappeared over that very mountain pass that they themselves dared not travel.
WYNANT: Think of it!
CARSTAIRS: By jove, that's what I call fortitude!
ROBERTSON: Tell me something, Gainsford. What do you think of his talk about Shangri-La? Do you believe it?
GAINSFORD: ( thinks a moment )
GAINSFORD: Gentlemen, I give you a toast. Here is my hope that Robert Conway will find his Shangri-La!
GAINSFORD: ( softly )
352. CLOSEUP: MOVING IN FRONT OF CONWAY - as he walks forward with a steady step - his head held high - his eyes sparkling - snow pelting his face.
