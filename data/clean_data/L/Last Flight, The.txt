FADE IN: EXT. BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT On a FREEZE FRAME of a huge mortar on the edge of a dismal no-man's land, surrounded by trees and overhanging branches. The distant roar of battle RUMBLES ominously. SUPERIMPOSED TITLES appear and hold for a moment.
WAR MONTAGE: Nothing but FAST, BRUTAL FLASH CUTS of:
CARY: Shep! Shep, are you all right?
SHEP: Can't make it, Cary. Can't make it.
CARY: Here, give me your arm! I'll get you out of here! Hang on there, Shep! Get a hold - Just hold tight, old fella.
ANOTHER CHART: swings into view. This one is for Lieutenant Cary Lockwood whose readings for October 27th to November 2nd are also below the CRITICAL mark. The line continues and improves considerably by November 11th when the final reading is marked NORMAL.
THE CLOCK: slowly DISSOLVES to one last BRIEF BATTLE MONTAGE: soldiers yelling and running, guns firing noisily, a plane crashing, explosions. The final image is of a plane parked on the ground, its engine dying, its propeller slowing to a stop as we DISSOLVE BACK TO the clock face. The center of the clock is lined up exactly with the center of the propeller the slowing propeller blades are replaced by the clock's hands as if to symbolically suggest that the war has ended but time goes on. The NOISE of battle fades and only the TICKING of the clock remains. DISSOLVE TO the calendar: November 11th, 1918 Armistice Day.
CARY: Well, the old guerre is finie.
SHEP: That's right.
CARY: What are ya gonna do now, Shep?
SHEP: Get tight.
CARY: ( turns to him ) And then what?
SHEP: Stay tight.
DOCTOR: Lieutenants Lambert and Lockwood. You two leaving us, eh? In a way, I'm sorry to release you two. I have no choice in the matter.
SHEP: What am I going to do, Major, about my oh, this rotten business?
DOCTOR: Mm? Spasmodic twitching of the muscles under the eye, eh, Mm hm.
SHEP: Mm hm.
DOCTOR: What the French call a tic. T-I-C, tic. Little bothersome, isn't it?
SHEP: Yes, sir.
DOCTOR: I'm afraid time'll have to take care of that. Time and normal living.
DOCTOR: You two are returning to the United States, I presume?
CARY: Ah, we haven't decided.
DOCTOR: I'd take the first boat home. Well, here you go.
DOCTOR: Oh, I forgot your burnt hands.
DOCTOR: Neither of you is fully hospitalized. I'd undertake a systematic course of finger exercises to, uh, stretch them and loosen them up. In time, you'll regain their full use.
CARY: Thank you, sir.
DOCTOR: Bye, Lieutenant.
DOCTOR: Bye, Lieutenant. Good luck.
DOCTOR: Well, there they go. Out to face And their whole training was in preparation for death.
AIDE: Why can't they go on with flying? You know, the air mails or I'm afraid they're unfit for further service in that direction.
DOCTOR: I'm afraid they're unfit for further service in that direction.
DOCTOR: They fell, you know six thousand Like dropping a fine Swiss watch on the pavement. Shattered both of them. Their nervous systems are deranged, disorganized, brittle.
AIDE: Spent bullets.
DOCTOR: Spent bullets. That's it. They're like projectiles, shaped for war and hurled at the enemy. They've described a beautiful, high-arching trajectory. And now they've fallen back to earth. Spent. Cooled off. Useless.
AIDE: Oh, well, if they take care of themselves, they'll pull through all right.
DOCTOR: Even if they do take care of themselves, what good are they? What can you expect of them? I hate to think what may become of them.
BILL: ( Texas accent ) Hello, Cary!
FRANCIS: Hi, Cary!
CARY: Hello, Bill! Hiya, Francis!
SHEP: Hello, Bill! Francis!
CARY: ( friendly ) Well, I see you got yours.
BILL: ( pleasantly ) Yup. We crashed.
BILL: ( calls down, puzzled ) Hey! Where you going?
CARY: BILL ( o.s. ) From the stairs, Francis smokes a cigarette and looks down at Shep and Cary uncertainly. But Bill takes the news in stride he smiles and waves his hat at them.
BILL: See you in Paris!
FRANCIS: ( waves his cigarette ) Smiling, Shep and Cary wave back as their car drives off.
CARY: How 'bout a cocktail?
SHEP: Not a bad idea at that.
NIKKI: still wearing a blank expression, clutches the glass in two hands.
THE GLASS: in her hands. Between her fingers, we glimpse its contents a complete set of men's false teeth.
CARY: I beg your pardon. But, if I'm not too inquisitive, would you mind telling me what IS that you're After another look, Cary turns to his friends.
NIKKI: After another look, Cary turns to his friends.
CARY: After another look, Cary turns to his friends.

NIKKI: That's right.
BILL: ( enthusiastic ) Yup. It's a full set upper and ( to Nikki ) It's a nice expression.
CARY: ( to Nikki ) It's a nice expression.
SHEP: Hey, how come you're with those I was just standing here. And a nice gentleman came along and begged my pardon and asked would I mind holding his teeth for a minute.
NIKKI: I was just standing here. And a nice gentleman came along and begged my pardon and asked would I mind holding his teeth for a minute.
CARY: Well, what did he want you to hold his teeth for?
NIKKI: Said he wanted to biff somebody.
BILL: ( excited ) Biff somebody?! Which way did he go?!
NIKKI: Just around to the right.
BILL: Come on, men! We're liable to see a As quickly as they arrived, Shep, Bill and Francis depart. Cary starts after them but stops to politely address Nikki who has gone back into her trance.
CARY: Would you like to come along?
NIKKI: ( as if it were obvious ) Oh, no. I have to stay here and mind the man's teeth.
CARY: Oh, of course.
BILL: Well. THAT'S all fixed.
CARY: Let's go back.
THE BAR: Nikki, no longer standing against the wall, sits on a bar stool with her back to the countertop, smoking a cigarette and holding an empty champagne glass. Our heroes enter and, glancing at the wall, fail to see her. After a moment of searching, Cary spots her at the bar.
CARY: Oh, there she is.
BILL: Well, we missed it.
NIKKI: Did something happen?
BILL: Well, they carried a guy out. Say! What's become of the teeth?
NIKKI: Oh, the man came and got his teeth.
CARY: Well, what did he say?
NIKKI: He said thank you for holding his What did he look like?
CARY: What did he look like?
NIKKI: I think he fell in an airplane in the war and got his teeth knocked Well, why do you think he was in the Oh, he had a kind of little striped ribbon in his buttonhole.
CARY: Well, why do you think he was in the Oh, he had a kind of little striped ribbon in his buttonhole.

CARY: His eyes? You can tell a flyer better by his The men chuckle.
SHEP: Well, what do you say we have a Sure, here's some space.
BILL: Sure, here's some space.

JEAN: Bon soir, Monsieur Lambert. Qu'est-ce que voulez-vous [?]
FRANCIS: Could I have a champagne cocktail?
BILL: Could I have a champagne cocktail?
CARY: Could I have a champagne cocktail?
SHEP: Could I have a champagne cocktail?
NIKKI: Could I have a champagne cocktail?
JEAN: Certainment, Mademoiselle. Quatre Martinis pour messieurs! Champagne cocktail pour Mademoiselle The men are all excited to find out her name. Francis uses a pretzel as a monocle to eye Nikki.
FRANCIS: For the first time this evening, Shep takes off his dark glasses.
BILL: For the first time this evening, Shep takes off his dark glasses.
CARY: For the first time this evening, Shep takes off his dark glasses.
SHEP: Can you imagine that, fellas? Her name is Nikki!
CARY: ( considers the situation ) Her name is Nikki. She holds men's teeth. She sits at the bar and she drinks champagne.
BILL: ( significantly ) Boys, she's gonna be a lot of Drinks are served. A moment of silence as they imbibe. Nikki's hand shakes as she lifts her glass, spilling some champagne. She laughs, embarrassed.
NIKKI: Oh, my, my!
SHEP: Poor sweet! She can't even hold her Nikki notices Cary unsteadily using both his hands to hold his Martini.
NIKKI: ( casually ) Oh, well, HE can't either. Besides, he has to use two hands.
SHEP: Course he can't hold his glass. His hands are burned.
NIKKI: You have no right to spill YOUR drinks. He can't help himself.
SHEP: You have no right to spill YOUR drinks. He can't help himself.
NIKKI: Burned? How burned?
SHEP: He brought a plane down on fire.
NIKKI: An airplane? In the war?
SHEP: He held the stick. But his hands began to slip. Then he held it inside his arms. He was trying to bring his rear gunner down alive.
NIKKI: Did he bring him down safe?
SHEP: Shep takes a swallow of his Martini, sets down the glass.
SHEP: Brought him down.
NIKKI: Oh, so that's why?
SHEP: Yes! That's why he can't hold a Oh, I'm so ashamed.
NIKKI: Oh, I'm so ashamed.
SHEP: Now, Cary's had a pretty thin time. His nerves are tricky. You should never call attention to his hands.
FRINK: Hi, Cary.
CARY: ( unhappily ) Oh, hello, Frink.
FRINK: Hello, Francis. Bill.
FRINK: Shep. Drunk again?
SHEP: Say, don't you know any OTHER opening remarks? It's about all we've heard from you for a year.
FRINK: ( signals the bartender ) Hi! Jean!
FRINK: Un sidecar.
JEAN: Sidecar . [?]
FRINK: Say, why don't you fellows go home and go to work?
SHEP: Work? What kind of work?
FRINK: Oh, anything useful.
BILL: What could we do? Sell washing machines? Drive a milk wagon? Mend old furniture or somethin'? Heh!
FRINK: Go back to flying. Fly the air Aw, we couldn't fly a kite.
BILL: Aw, we couldn't fly a kite.
FRANCIS: Maybe a small kite.
FRINK: Well, there must be something you can do.
SHEP: We've got to tend to our drinking. We don't get much opportunity.
FRINK: Lots of things going on outside. Sun shining, trees growing, people walking around.
BILL: Say! Is that STILL going on?
SHEP: ( laughs ) Sounds pretty pre-war to me.
FRINK: Hey. Don't I rate an introduction? Who's your swell friend?
SHEP: Oh, her? Just an old hussy we found scattered around.
SHEP: ( off Frink ) Pay no attention. Sometimes he goes Nikki looks away glumly as Shep grins at her. She turns and sees something. She raises her lorgnette for a better look at:
CARY: who sits at his table, staring into space, holding his unread menu in his lap.
NIKKI: is pleased to see Cary.
NIKKI: Oh! He didn't go.
CARY: startled, rises and stares at Nikki as she approaches.
NIKKI: Oh, I'm so sorry. Your hands.
NIKKI: Oh, your poor hands! Your poor, poor Wildly uncomfortable, Cary glances around like a cornered animal and finally stalks away without a word, hands still stuffed in his pockets. Stunned, Nikki watches him exit the building. She realizes she's done something terribly wrong and moves to follow him.
NIKKI: But Shep intercepts her. Upset, she whimpers.
SHEP: ( more in disbelief than anger ) If you aren't the WORST! First, you insult his hands and make him mad. Then you cry over them and make him self-conscious. Come on back here. Come on.
THE BAR: Francis and Bill watch, disturbed, as Shep guides a crying Nikki onto a stool beside them. Shep sits next to her as she continues to sob. She pulls out a compact to fix her tear-stained face.
SHEP: Well, that's torn it. He'll never come back now.
NIKKI: Then we'll have to find him.
SHEP: What for?
NIKKI: To explain how sorry I am.
SHEP: ( amused at her distress ) We-ell. You don't have to get so emotional about it.
NIKKI: Who's getting emotional?
SHEP: You are. You're coming all apart. Here. Take a drink of this. Make you laugh and play.
BILL: ( to Shep ) Say, what's she crying about?
SHEP: She's crying on account of they didn't wash her strawberries this Didn't they wash your strawberries this morning? Well, there ain't a whole hell of a lot that we can do about that now.
BILL: ( to Nikki ) Didn't they wash your strawberries this morning? Well, there ain't a whole hell of a lot that we can do about that now.
NIKKI: ( agrees, sadly ) ANOTHER VIEW Frink watches suspiciously as Shep pays the tab, rises and whispers to Nikki.
ANOTHER VIEW: Frink watches suspiciously as Shep pays the tab, rises and whispers to Nikki.
SHEP: Let's go.
BILL: Hey! Where're you goin'?!
SHEP: Oh, out.
BILL: ( rises ) Out where?!
BILL: Don't you suppose you could arrange that here?!
SHEP: Nope. We gotta go somewheres else.
BILL: ( without missing a beat ) Okay. Come on, Francis. We got to go somewheres else to get a drink.
BILL: Hey! There he is!
SHEP: Come on!
BILL: Come on!
BILL: Say, what are you tryin' to do, disown us?
CARY: ( genuinely polite ) Hello. Won't you sit down?
BILL: Sure we'll sit down. What'd ya think we'd do? Stand around?
BILL: ( with a wave, to Frink ) Thank you.
SHEP: Hello, Cary.
CARY: Hello, Shep. Hello, Nikki. What will you have to drink?
FRANCIS: Quatre Martinis?
BILL: Quatre Martinis?
SHEP: Quatre Martinis?
FRINK: Quatre Martinis?
WAITER: Quatre Martinis?
NIKKI: Uh, could I have champagne, please?
WAITER: Champagne? Oui.
BILL: Boys, she's goin' to be a problem.
NIKKI: ( explains, to Bill ) That's what I started on. ( to Cary ) It upsets me if I change over to anything else.
CARY: ( to Bill ) There's a lot of things wrong with this one. ( to Nikki ) What were you doing at the bar at Claridge's anyway?
SHEP: Yes. Don't you know you're not supposed to be there?
FRANCIS: There's a sign on the wall says ladies must sit at the back.
NIKKI: Can't read signs.
SHEP: Well, we'll just have to take care of her, that's all.
BILL: Do you think she's good-lookin' Oh, I know I'm not very good- looking but
NIKKI: Oh, I know I'm not very good- looking but
CARY: But what?
NIKKI: But when I was a little girl, my mother always said I had the nicest Shep laughs derisively. The others give him a look and he shuts up. The drinks arrive. All the men, save Cary, snatch up their glasses. Bill removes the toothpicked olive and swallows his Martini whole. He watches Nikki rubbing her champagne's drinking straw between her hands as if she were a Boy Scout trying to start a fire.
BILL: Then there's her drinking.
NIKKI: What's the matter with my drinking?
BILL: You're a sissy drinker.
NIKKI: Well, maybe I can improve.
BILL: Then there's her teeth. Why, one of 'em is turned sideways.
NIKKI: ( points ) You mean this one?
BILL: That's it.
CARY: Why don't you have it turned around?
NIKKI: I don't have it turned around on account of it's a kind of help.
CARY: Well, in what respect does it kind of help?
NIKKI: Well, you see, when anyone kisses me too hard, it splits my lip. And you could tell when anyone kissed me too hard on account of my lip would bleed. So now I don't let anyone kiss me hard.
CARY: Well, we'll let that pass.
NIKKI: Where's he gone?
CARY: Shep went off to sharpen his skates.
BILL: Now, about your nose.
NIKKI: What about my nose?
BILL: It isn't straight. It kind of turns up at the end.
NIKKI: Well, when I was a little girl, I got bumped by a swing.
CARY: How'd you happen to get bumped?
NIKKI: I just walked through the gate. I was only seven.
CARY: Oh, poor dear. Didn't you see it?
NIKKI: I can't see very far.
CARY: Did it hurt?
NIKKI: It made me dizzy all day.
CARY: Well, I guess we can't hold that against her.
BILL: We all make mistakes.
CARY: That's right. Michelangelo painted Adam with a navel.
NIKKI: All the same, he'd look funny the other way even in a painting.
NIKKI: Where's he gone?
BILL: He went off to shave a horse.
CARY: Have you got a husband or anything?
NIKKI: No husband.
CARY: A mother?
NIKKI: Mother, yes. But we haven't met in quite a long time.
CARY: Why not in a long time?
NIKKI: Well, on account of my mother's name was Beulah. Now, you can't have a mother named Beulah. So I changed it to Jane. And that's how it all began.
FRANCIS: the narcoleptic, arms folded, asleep in his chair. He awakes with a frown, pulls a pocket watch from inside his jacket, opens it, and looks at it. The chiming ends and he rises without a word and exits.
BILL: He's goin' off to tame an alligator.
NIKKI: Who is he, anyway?
CARY: Francis used to fly with us in the 94th. The best shot in the squadron. Brought down twelve planes. Used to call him "Sudden Death." He lost interest after his teammate got killed. He's lonesome is all.
NIKKI: I like him.
CARY: He carries a chiming watch on account of he's always falling asleep in the daytime.
NIKKI: What kind of chimes?
CARY: Oh, Westminster, Canterbury, and I'll take vanilla.
NIKKI: I'll take vanilla.
BILL: I think he's a washout.
SHEP: Well, just because you're a big bombardier and an All-American
NIKKI: ( interrupts ) All-American what?
SHEP: Oh, Montana State or somewhere. Idaho or Nebraska or the Carlisle Indians or something. Didn't you never read about Bill? Bronko Bill the Alabama Flash?
FRINK: Oh, Montana State or somewhere. Idaho or Nebraska or the Carlisle Indians or something. Didn't you never read about Bill? Bronko Bill the Alabama Flash?
CARY: Oh, Montana State or somewhere. Idaho or Nebraska or the Carlisle Indians or something. Didn't you never read about Bill? Bronko Bill the Alabama Flash?
NIKKI: ( skeptical ) I think it's a forgery.
BILL: Say! What do you want me to do? Tackle a horse?
SHEP: Sure. Go ahead. Tackle a horse.
BILL: ( with a dismissive wave ) All right, all right, I'll tackle a Shep looks down the street.
SHEP: Here comes one now.
BILL: Look out, horse!
CARY: Hey, Bill! Bill! Come back here!
NIKKI: ( distraught ) Oh, Bill!
CARY: Hey! What's the idea runnin' down my friend like that? Here!
WIDER VIEW: of the fallen horse as the driver descends from the cab. Standing up now, Bill tries to haul the horse to its feet while Cary tries to placate the driver.
CARY: Never mind. Look where you're going in the future now. You just watch out where you're going!
ANOTHER VIEW: Bill grabs the horse by its bridle and tries to pull it up. The horse, sorely annoyed, gets up on its own and shakes its head violently to drive Bill away. Bill hangs on and tries to calm the horse. Cary tries to pull Bill away as Frink, Francis and the driver gather around. Bill is more interested in petting the horse which understandably shies away from him.
CARY: ( admonishes Bill ) Now listen, come on out here, you old fool. ( to the shying horse ) Whoa, whoa.
BILL: Nice horsie.
CARY: ( to Bill ) Now, listen, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. You old fool! You know what you'll do? You'll kill yourself one of these days. Now, come on, get out of here. Now, listen
CARY: ( to the driver ) You all right now, brother?
CARY: All right. Now, you just keep your horse, see? You got your money.
CARY: Hey, listen, Bill, you're All- American, see? You're TWO All- Americans! The lady's convinced you're the whole team. You don't have to tackle any more horses. How 'bout that? Drink your drink.
BILL: ( pleased with himself ) Ahhh. Wasn't that a great spill?
SHEP: Hey! Where are you going?
NIKKI: Would you all excuse me for a Well, where are you going?
CARY: Well, where are you going?
NIKKI: ( a grave announcement ) To take a Chinese singing lesson.
FRANCIS: The men rise and all but Frink cheer her lustily as she departs:
MEN: Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!
NIKKI: walks proudly into the restaurant as the men cheer. A smiling maitre d' directs her to the ladies' room.
BILL: Hey. What kind of a girl do you think Nikki is?
CARY: I think she's the kind that sits down on phonograph records.
FRINK: Say, Nikki, let's ditch these drunks and go off somewhere by ourselves. These crazy fools are liable to do anything.
NIKKI: ( hopeful ) Do you think so?
FRINK: Since the war, they don't care what And do you?
NIKKI: And do you?
FRINK: I'll say so. I've got more important things to think of.
NIKKI: What more important things?
FRINK: Well, my work.
NIKKI: What kind of work?
FRINK: I'm the foreign correspondent for a New York newspaper syndicate.
NIKKI: ( genuinely ) How nice for you!
FRANCIS: Nikki? Are you the kind of girl that sits down on phonograph records?
NIKKI: ( a bit defensively ) People shouldn't leave their records lying about.
CARY: ( to Francis ) What did I tell you?
NIKKI: ( abruptly brightens ) Take me dancing?
BILL: What place you wanna go?
NIKKI: What places you got?
CARY: Well, we got Maxim's, only it's too early. We've got Florida, Perroquet, Pigalle, Le Rat Mort, Moulin Rouge, Bal Tabarin.
NIKKI: I'll take vanilla.
BILL: Somebody pay for the drinks!
BILL: We're off in a "billizzard" of Whatever that means. The men rise and retrieve their hats.
NIKKI: My, my! Isn't this nice?!
BILL: Now, listen, men. I'll tell ya something funny.
BILL: I was only four years old once.
FRANCIS: ( to Cary ) What'd he say?
CARY: Said he was only four years old And my aunt had a very low-neck dress on.
FRANCIS: And my aunt had a very low-neck dress on.
BILL: And my aunt had a very low-neck dress on.
FRANCIS: ( to Cary ) What'd he say?
CARY: Said his aunt had on a very low-neck Can't believe it.
FRANCIS: Can't believe it.
BILL: And she sat right across the table in front of me. And I said, "Auntie I can see your knees!"
CARY: ( pointedly, after an awkward pause ) I wonder what's doing in Portugal Bill is disappointed at the response.
BILL: Maybe I'd better do my match trick.
NIKKI: If you do match tricks, I'll recite.
CARY: Recite what?
NIKKI: Whose poetry?
CARY: Whose poetry?
NIKKI: My poetry.
CARY: You write poetry?
NIKKI: I'll send you a photograph of my Cary gives her a look, then rises and peers with one eye into the open bottle of champagne on the table between him and Nikki. He gestures at the bottle as he sits back down.
CARY: Say, I wonder if there's anything intoxicating in that.
WIDER: Nikki rises indignantly and turns on Frink.
NIKKI: Just what ARE your plans?
WIDER STILL: The other men seated at the table understand instantly what's going on and stare darkly at Frink.
SHEP: You'll have to watch that lad, Nikki. He's a member of the Wandering Hands Society and he has a groping good Frink nervously adjusts his necktie. Cary glares at him.
CARY: Your behavior, sir, is unseemly, unethical, indelicate and lousy. Have I made myself clear?
FRINK: All right. My mistake. I'm sorry.
CARY: You'll have to watch out for him, Nikki. He's just a licentious old It's getting pretty late, isn't it?
NIKKI: It's getting pretty late, isn't it?
CARY: Do you want to go home, Nikki? I'll take you home. Where do you Hotel Carlton.
NIKKI: Hotel Carlton.
BILL: I'll take her home, too.
FRANCIS: So will I!
SHEP: We'll match to see who takes her Nothin' doing! We'll ALL take her I saw her first.
BILL: Nothin' doing! We'll ALL take her I saw her first.
CARY: I saw her first.
BILL: It makes no difference. She belongs to us all now!
BILL: ( quietly, to Nikki ) Sh! Let him sleep. What's your ( whispers ) Bill waves the others on and they exit toward the elevators.
NIKKI: ( whispers ) Bill waves the others on and they exit toward the elevators.
BILL: Here we are. Goin' up!
CARY: Who's gonna pilot this craft?
BILL: I'll take her off. Where's the Bill looks for the controls as Cary turns playfully to the others.
CARY: Got your safety belts buckled?
BILL: Here it is. Contact?
SHEP: Bill pulls the lever and the car rockets up the shaft.
BILL: We're off!
FRANCIS: Shut her off!
CARY: Hold her nose! She's headed for the Hey, stop it, will ya?

FRINK: That's right, laugh.
CARY: We should've brought our parachutes!
BILL: Get a good hold, Millie. We're off Bill reaches for the controls but Shep grabs the tail of Bill's jacket and pulls him away.
SHEP: Nothing doing! Let Cary take the controls. You'll run us through the Bill brushes his hands, his pride a little hurt.
BILL: All right, all right.
CARY: All set?
SHEP: Let her go!
NIKKI: SHEP & FRANCIS There we are.
CARY: There we are.
SHEP: Say! That's a pilot for ya.

BILL: All right, come on, men.
FRANCIS: I need a rest, I need a rest.
BILL: Come on, come on.
NIKKI: Right here.

NIKKI'S BEDROOM: as the other four men respond to Bill's enthusiastic summons and enter.
BILL: Hey! Come on in and look at Nikki's Cary joins Bill at the table as the Texan picks up one of the bottles and reads the label.
BILL: Ylang! Ylang!

FRANCIS: Say, I never saw so many shoes.
BILL: Bill drops the garment on the bed and moves to the night table.
BILL: She never winds her clock! It says eleven and I've never been anywheres at eleven.
CARY: ( dry, to Bill ) What time are you anywhere?
BILL: ( to Cary, ignoring Nikki ) Two o'clock. It's always two o'clock in my life. Hey, listen. Besides never having any matches and always spilling her drinks, she never winds her clock! Think I'll go in the bathroom and see if she leaves the cap off her tooth paste.
BILL: Is it all right?
NIKKI: Help yourself.
NIKKI: ( friendly, sympathetic ) ( grins ) Hello, yourself.
CARY: ( grins ) Hello, yourself.
TURTLES!: Cary turns toward the bathroom.
CARY: SHEP ( o.s. ) Shep runs past and hurries into the bathroom. Cary rises from the bed to follow. Nikki is perhaps mildly surprised by the excitement.
BATHROOM: Bill kneels by the tub as Frink, Shep, Francis and Cary join him. Bill points out his discovery to the others.
BILL: ( thrilled ) It IS turtles!
OTHERS: ( thrilled ) It IS turtles!
SHEP: ( thrilled ) It IS turtles!

NIKKI: ( thinks about this ) Well, then, I don't think he should be left alone. ( beat ) Tell me, what's Cary doing in Paris?
SHEP: What are we all doing in Paris?
NIKKI: I know. But why doesn't he go home?
SHEP: Well, he's not ready to go home. What could he do if he went home? Have people cry over his hands?

Cary joins her and, after a word to the driver ( "Restez ici." ), looks at the rain.
CARY: ( to Nikki ) Perhaps we'd better stay here a while till it clears up.
NIKKI: Could we sit down here, do you I think so. Would you like something to drink?
CARY: I think so. Would you like something to drink?
NIKKI: What should I drink now, do you Cary orders the drinks as Nikki moves to sit at a table.
CARY: ( to the waiter ) Deux picon citrons.
NIKKI: Picon citrons?
CARY: Very refreshing. Make you laugh and That's what you always promise. Cary, why does Shep Lambert go on drinking so desperately?
NIKKI: ( amused ) That's what you always promise. ( suddenly serious ) Cary, why does Shep Lambert go on drinking so desperately?
CARY: Don't we all?
NIKKI: Not like Shep.
CARY: Well, Shep has that tic under his eye, you know. Takes a lot of drinks to keep that quiet.
NIKKI: But isn't there some kind of treatment or something?
CARY: Shep could never stand a long course of treatment. Drinking's the only corrective so far as he's concerned. He's found out the tic doesn't work when he's tight. So he stays tight.
NIKKI: Seems such a pity. How did he get the tic?
CARY: In the war.
NIKKI: I know. But how?
CARY: Well, it's not very romantic.

CARY: He'll have to be - reborn.
NIKKI: How's he going to end?
CARY: Well, how are you going to end? How am I going to end? How is ANYONE going to end? How's your picon citron go?
NIKKI: It goes fine. But doesn't ANYTHING make any difference to you?
CARY: Not now. A long time ago, perhaps, when I was a little boy.
NIKKI: Tell me, where were you little?
CARY: In Minnesota. On a farm.
NIKKI: Were you happy then, Cary?
CARY: I think so.
NIKKI: Tell me, what WAS there to be happy about on a farm in Minnesota?
CARY: ( lost in thought ) Ohhh, thorn-apple trees in blossom. The smell of burning leaves in the fall. The sound of horses' hoofs on the road. ( looks at Nikki ) Did you ever dig up an Indian mound or uncover a nest of baby field mice? Or explore old trunks in an attic? Listen to the moaning of the telephone wires in the winter wind? See a gypsy caravan?
NIKKI: ( enthralled ) So THAT'S why you were happy. On account of apple blossoms and field mice and telephone wires and gypsy caravans and old trunks and things?
CARY: That's right.
NIKKI: But aren't you going back? Not ever?

CARY: Well, they're buried here in the same sepulchre side by side.
NIKKI: Why are they buried side by side?
CARY: They were the world's most famous There's the tomb.
NIKKI: Tell me about the world's most famous lovers.
CARY: Well, Abélard was a scholastic Whatever that is.

NIKKI: You were so nice to let me come with you. I spoiled your whole day. You were going to do something else, weren't you?
CARY: ( looks away ) Doesn't matter.
NIKKI: Well, what was it, Cary? Why did you come here today?
CARY: ( not looking at her ) To pay my respects to an old comrade.
NIKKI: Oh. And you wanted to be alone. I'm sorry. Oh, I'm so sorry. Don't pay any attention to me, Cary. I can't help it. You MAKE me cry.
