LEGION: Written by
WOMAN'S VOICE: When I was a little girl, my mother would remind me each night before bed to be sure to open my heart to God, for he was kind, merciful and just. Things changed after my father left a few years later, leaving her to raise me and my brothers alone in a little place out on the edge of the Mojave Desert. She never talked about a kind and merciful God again. Instead she spoke of a prophecy. Of a time when all the world would be covered in darkness and the fate of Mankind would be decided. One night I finally got up the courage to ask my mother why God had changed, why was he mad at his children. "I don't know," she said, tucking the covers around me, "I guess he just got tired of all the bullshit."
BURTON: Goddamn' animals. Nights like this I wish I could take a match to this city just so I could watch all these motherfuckers burn.
ESTEVEZ: ( LAUGHS ) A good ol' boy barbecue, huh?
BURTON: A fresh start. That's what this place needs.
BURTON: Pow! Pow! Pow!
ESTEVEZ: Jesus. You know Burton, I'm so happy we get to share beautiful moments like this. They really brighten my da
ESTEVEZ: Drop the bags! Hands on your head!
MICHAEL: ( sensing their unease: ) It's starting. There isn't much
BURTON: Shut the fuck up and drop the bags
ESTEVEZ: Hands on your head! On your head!
BURTON: Turn around! Turn the fuck around!
BURTON: Let `em go!
ESTEVEZ: Take the shot, Burton!
BURTON: I said let `em fuckin' g-g-g-g
ESTEVEZ: THE STREET LAMPS BEGIN TO FLICKER AND STROBE, adding to the Burton squeezes his eyes shut in pain, his WHOLE BODY QUAKING, heels CLICKING the pavement, as if some massive pressure were building inside him. And with the horrific sound of CRACKING BONES, BURTON'S MOUTH
CLOWN!: His eyes SNAP OPEN, focused, the force inside him now fully in control. Burton looks at Michael with calm recognition, his voice GUTTURAL..INHUMAN. A man possessed.
BURTON: What are you doing, Michael? These weren't your orders.
ESTEVEZ: What did you say?
MICHAEL: I'm following my own orders now.
BURTON: Then you will die along with the Burton, you fuckin' know this guy?!
ESTEVEZ: Burton, you fuckin' know this guy?!
JEEP: Sorry to wake you, Charlie.
CHARLIE: ( stepping out of the
BELLY ): Wasn't you. He's been kickin' up a storm all night. Must know somethin' I don't.
CHARLIE: Another bad dream?
CHARLIE: It's just stress, Jeep, that's all. You do too much worryin'. About this place. About your dad.
JEEP: You're the only thing I like worrying about.
CHARLIE: See what I mean? You're worried about a girl eight months pregnant and it isn't even your baby. Now that's enough to give anybody
JEEP: Go ahead, make fun of me. Everybody else does.
CHARLIE: ( turns him back around ) C'mon, I was only kiddin'. You know how much I appreciate everything you and Bob are doing for me, but a month from now, this baby'll have a new family and I'll have to start thinkin' about what the hell I'm doin' with my life.
JEEP: So you're still going through with Jeep, I'm not ready to be a mama. Christ, I can barely take care of myself as it is.
CHARLIE: Jeep, I'm not ready to be a mama. Christ, I can barely take care of myself as it is.
JEEP: I could help you. We could do it together, you know? I want to.
CHARLIE: You gotta stop carryin' the weight of the world on your shoulders.
CHARLIE: ( rubbing her arms ) Now can we go back in? I'm freezing my ass off out here.
JEEP: Go on. I'll be right there.
PERCY: Lord as my witness, Bob, one of these days that thing's gonna hit you back.
WHACK!: Whaddya talkin' about, Percy? We got a special relationship here.
BOB: Whaddya talkin' about, Percy? We got a special relationship here.
WHACK!: Yeah, they got names for that kind a relationship.
PERCY: Yeah, they got names for that kind a relationship.
SANDRA: Really, how can she go out in public wearing that?
HOWARD: I don't know. Why don't we just ask her?
SANDRA: Howard, don't. You'll embarrass
HOWARD: ( shouting across the
DINER ): Audrey, honey? Your mother was wondering if you got dressed this morning with the specific intention of showing your ass off to the entire world?
AUDREY: Yeah, that's cuz I woke up hoping to get double teamed by a couple of meth head truckers in the bathroom of some desert shithole.
HOWARD: I feel satisfied with that answer. I really do.
SANDRA: I'm being punished for something, I know it.
KYLE: He spots the truck stop diner just up the road ahead.
KYLE: Darren, your fuckin' directions suck, man.
KYLE: She eyes him, mildly intrigued, takes a drag.
KYLE: You know that shit right there ain't good for the baby.
CHARLIE: Guess I should think `bout quittin' Now hold on, girl, let me bum one before you do.
KYLE: Now hold on, girl, let me bum one before you do.
CHARLIE: You can buy a whole pack inside.
KYLE: Tell ya what. You let me have one of yours, and I'll give you two from the new pack you're gonna sell
KYLE: Am I in the right place?
CHARLIE: ( peers at the map ) Only if nowhere's right, `cause that's where you are.
KYLE: Sonuvabitch. There another phone around here? You know, one that Bob'll probably let you use the diner phone if you ask him real nice.And pay `im somethin'.
CHARLIE: Bob'll probably let you use the diner phone if you ask him real nice.And pay `im somethin'.
KYLE: I can handle that. You got pancakes here?
CHARLIE: Yeah, we got a buttermilk stack for three seventy-five. We also got french toast for four dollars if you're into that. I personally like the pancakes though.
CHARLIE: Yeah, I'm okay. This guy's just
KYLE: Three seventy-five, huh?
CHARLIE: I hope Salem Lights are okay, `cause that's all we got left.
KYLE: If I can smoke `em, I'll take `em.
BOB: This ain't a resort you know. I got orders stacking up here.
BOB: ( sees the two cigarettes You best not be smokin' again. Not in your condition.
CHARLIE: ( gestures to the diner ) Bob, do you see where am I right now? Can my condition really get any worse? `Sides, you ain't one to talk.
BOB: What? I quit two years ago.
CHARLIE: Yeah, so why you still carryin' that fancy lighter `round for?
BOB: It was a gift from my ex-wife, alright? I'm sentimental. I don't wanna forget how much I hate her Hey man?
KYLE: Hey man?
KYLE: Can I use your phone? My cell doesn't get a signal out here and the pay phone outside is busted.
HOWARD: Any news about when our truck might be fixed? You said your boy would have us on the road two hours ago. The rate we're going, we'll be lucky to make it to Scottsdale by
BOB: Goddamn it. Where the hell is
BOB: The fact that this truck's hood's up mean anything to you?
JEEP: ( approaches, peering past
BOB: ( approaches, peering past
JEEP: Jeep tries feebly to block his path, fails. Bob looks down at the crib with dismay.
JEEP: Found it under a bunch of stuff in the storage shed. I know you never like to throw anything away.
BOB: Whaddya doin'?
JEEP: Jeep, I like Charlie. I do. And I think it's real good of you to lend her a helping hand, but she is not your responsibility.
BOB: Jeep, I like Charlie. I do. And I think it's real good of you to lend her a helping hand, but she is not your responsibility.
JEEP: ( heard this before, pushes Oh whatever, leave me alone.
BOB: Don't walk away from me while I'm talkin' to you!
BOB: How long you gonna follow her around like a puppy dog? Cleanin' up the messes she makes while she steps out with every guy around here other than you?!
JEEP: Don't say that about her! She's not like that!
BOB: You really think she's gonna stick around here after that baby's born and off her hands?
JEEP: Look, I know it doesn't make any sense to you, but it's just something I have to do.
BOB: ( points up at the PARADISE See that up there? Your mother thought I was crazy for wanting to buy this place, middle of nowhere.But I just knew this was what I was supposed to do. Told your mom, "just wait." Told her when they finally ran the freeway through here like they were plannin' on, this place would be like Grand Central Station.
JEEP: C'mon Dad. You can't blame yourself for what she did
BOB: Yeah, I can. And I'm sayin' you're about to make the same damn mistake I made, believing in something that's never gonna happen.Or It's time for you to move on from this place, Jeep. I don't wanna see you wake up one morning old and pissed off, realizing you're lost just like everybody else who stops
BOB: Now get to work on that truck. I wanna have these people on the road by nightfall.
BOB: ( holding up a silencing
HAND ): Yeah, wait a minute.
BOB: What's wrong with you today?
WHACK!: The image flickers but doesn't improve.
PERCY: I told you to get the satellite TV. But you don't wanna listen.
BOB: What the hell do I need that crap History Channel, man!
PERCY: History Channel, man!
BOB: I got all the history I can take.
CHARLIE: That's for sure.
BOB: What's your problem now?
WHACK!: Where do I start?
CHARLIE: Where do I start?
BOB: You know this was the top-of-the- line model when I bought it.
CHARLIE: Yeah, in the Fifties.
BOB: You shouldn't be watchin' anyways. Okay, baby, this is gonna do it.
BOB: See? Clear as day.
PERCY: Nice work, Bob. What the hell's It's just one of those test things.
BOB: It's just one of those test things.
CHARLIE: Don't look like a test.
KYLE: Yo, am I the Invisible motherfuckin' Man here? Do you have a phone or not? In the back past the kitchen. Make it fast.
BOB: In the back past the kitchen. Make it fast.
SANDRA: If there's a real emergency aren't they supposed to give us some information about what to do?
HOWARD: I'm sure it's a mistake.
BOB: Hey, Percy, give that old radio of yours a shot. Maybe they got some news about the TV.
HEARD ): Wait. You're breakin' up.
KYLE: What the hell.
HOWARD: They keep sayin' we're overdue for a big one.
PERCY: Lot a folks could be hurt.
BOB: Not if it was centered in the Exactly. Could be nothing to worry So then why's the TV out?
HOWARD: Exactly. Could be nothing to worry So then why's the TV out?
SANDRA: So then why's the TV out?
HOWARD: Maybe it just hit the relay stations. Aren't those usually in remote areas?
BOB: Yeah, `cause of the radiation they give off.
PERCY: There ain't no radiation comin' from those things. Plus that don't explain the radio being out too. Some of those stations broadcast over hundreds of miles. Any quake that big and we would a felt it.
CHARLIE: Percy's right. I didn't feel Maybe it's a terrorist attack or Oh god.
AUDREY: Maybe it's a terrorist attack or Oh god.
SANDRA: ( covers her mouth ) Oh god.
BOB: Well, for cryin' out loud. There's no use in speculating. I'll just call my brother up in Needles. He must a heard something.
BOB: Whaddya talkin' about?
KYLE: Phone's dead. Just tried to make a You're shittin' me.
BOB: You're shittin' me.
SANDRA: Oh, this is just great.
BOB: Relax, Mrs. Anderson. Nothing to get excited about. Probably just working on the lines.
JEEP: Damn it!
CHARLIE: Have a seat wherever you want, Ma'am. Specials are on the board.
OLD WOMAN: Thank you, dear.
OLD WOMAN: Oh, I already know what I want.
CHARLIE: Okay, what'll it be?
OLD WOMAN: I'll have the steak, please.
CHARLIE: And how'd you like that cooked?
OLD WOMAN: Rare if you would. And water, no Coming right up.
CHARLIE: Coming right up.
OLD WOMAN: Charlie, is it?
CHARLIE: OLD WOMAN
OLD WOMAN: What an unusual name for a girl.
CHARLIE: So they say. I'll be right back with your water.
OLD WOMAN: Hello, I'm Gladys. Gladys Foster.
SANDRA: Nice to meet you, Gladys. I'm Sandra and this is my husband What a nice young couple you are. What brings you out to these parts?
GLADYS: What a nice young couple you are. What brings you out to these parts?
SANDRA: We're moving out to Scottsdale. But our truck broke down, and so we're stuck here while it's being Oh, what a nuisance.
GLADYS: Oh, what a nuisance.
SANDRA: Say, Gladys, it seems the lines are down around here. The phone and TV, you know?
GLADYS: Oh, don't worry yourself about that, sweetheart. It'll all be over soon.
JEEP: The carburetor's shot. Don't know why. Looks brand new.
BOB: ( glances over at the
ANDERSONS ): Ah, shit. They're gonna be pissed.
JEEP: I could try to rebuild it, but it'd take a while, and I don't think we have all the parts. If we call right now, we might be able to get a new one down here tomorrow That's not gonna happen. Goddamn phone's out.
BOB: That's not gonna happen. Goddamn phone's out.
JEEP: Across the diner, Charlie places a bloody red steak in front of Gladys.
GLADYS: Thank you, dear. How far along are
CHARLIE: Just about there.
GLADYS: The father must be very proud.
CHARLIE: I wouldn't know.
GLADYS: You mean he's.
CHARLIE: Out of sight. Out of mind.
GLADYS: Oh, I see. So you're not married, I take it?
CHARLIE: Gladys starts to dig in to the steak with a real ferociousness you wouldn't expect from an old lady. More FLIES begin to land on her body. On her food. Charlie is still trying to wave them away.
GLADYS: That's too bad.
CHARLIE: No, I prefer it that way. I don't a need a man tellin' me what to do.
GLADYS: But what about the baby?
CHARLIE: I've got it under control.
GLADYS: Yeah, but it's gonna burn.
CHARLIE: What did you just say?
GLADYS: ( all smiles ) I said your fucking baby's gonna
CHARLIE: Go to hell, lady.
BOB: What happened?
CHARLIE: Total fucking Jesus freak. All those babies. They're gonna Gladys, please. There's no reason
GLADYS: All those babies. They're gonna Gladys, please. There's no reason
SANDRA: Gladys, please. There's no reason
GLADYS: Shut up, you stupid fucking cunt! All you do is complain! Complain!
SANDRA: Howard, it's okay! Don't listen to
HOWARD: Who the hell do you think you are, lady?! Now, I'd like you to apologize to my
GLADYS: You're all going to fucking die!
BOB: Don't move!
UPSIDE DOWN!: BOB PUMPS THE SHOTGUN, trying to take her down, but he can't track her fast enough. Instead he blows ENORMOUS HOLES in the ceiling, a rain of plaster. Gladys drops down right in front of Bob.
BOB: ( struggles to cock the
GUN ): Gladys smiles sweetly before SLAPPING HIM CLEAR ACROSS THE
ROOM!: The shotgun clatters to the floor at Jeep's feet. He snatches it up and aims it at Gladys who turns calmly to face Jeep's about to fire, when the old lady's EYES GO ALL WHITE.
PERCY: Shoot her, Jeep!
GLADYS: ( a sickly sweet smile ) You'll never save her.
PERCY: SHOOT THE FUCKING BITCH!
KYLE: Press your hands over the hole! Don't look at me like that, lady! I'm tryin' to fuckin' help you! Now put your goddamn hands over the hole before your husband bleeds to
KYLE: Don't look at me like that, lady! I'm tryin' to fuckin' help you! Now put your goddamn hands over the hole before your husband bleeds to
BOB: The fuck was that?! What the fuck was that!?
KYLE: How far to the hospital?
PERCY: Seventy, maybe eighty miles.
AUDREY: What's that on the road?
KYLE: They're fuckin' clouds! What the fuck do they look like?
AUDREY: Not clouds. Clouds don't buzz.
SPLAT!: And that's when they realize it. Those aren't clouds.
THEY'RE FLIES!: The Escalade enters the SWARM. The car is PUMMELED by insects, the windshield instantly covered in BLACK AND RED bug guts. Driving blind! The sound of FLIES SPLATTERING and BUZZING is deafening! Everyone SCREAMS as hell surrounds them.
BOB: I don't understand how she was still standin' after Percy hit `er with that goddamn fryin' pan. Broke her fuckin' neck. I saw it. I swear I did.
BOB: It's okay, Jeep. It's okay.
JEEP: I couldn't pull the trigger. I froze. I saw what I needed to do, but I was afraid. She could've killed you!
BOB: There's nothin' to be ashamed of, Not everybody can play the hero.
BOB: ( catching Percy by the
ARM ): Where you going?!
PERCY: To get my bible!
BOB: The hell you need that for?!
PERCY: Well somebody's gotta start
PERCY: ( raises a bottle of
ALCOHOL ): Okay, hold `em steady.
CHARLIE: ( nods, peakish, to
HERSELF ): Oh god, please don't throw up.
BOB: She's cold as a freakin' ice cube. If I hadn't just seen her walk in here, I'd say the old bag's been dead for hours.
KYLE: Well, I don't care how long she's been dead, the bitch ain't stayin' in here with us.
BOB: I don't get it. Why don't they come closer?
KYLE: How the fuck am I supposed to know, man? You askin' me to explain the behavior of a motherfuckin'
JEEP: ( holding up the keys ) You guys!
BOB: You see anything?
KYLE: No Twilight Zone shit if that's what you mean.
BOB: Careful. Old lady could have some kind of rabid poodle locked up in
KYLE: Agh! What the fuck is that?
BOB: Kyle opens the passenger door, looks in. Dark, dirty. But nothing unusual.
KYLE: Nothin' here.
JEEP: How `bout the trunk?
KYLE: Bitch's got motherfuckin' dead cats in her hoopty! What the fuck is wrong with white people?!
BOB: Least now we know where that smell was coming from.
KYLE: Yeah, it was a real motherfuckin' necessity we figured that out, man.
JEEP: ( sees something up the
ROAD ): They turn to see HEADLIGHTS growing larger in the dim haze. A POLICE CRUISER careens off the highway and skids to a wild stop in front of the diner. Its ENGINE RATTLES as the dust clears around it. No movement can be seen behind its bug splattered windows.
BOB: Okay, now we're talkin'.
JEEP: Wait a minute. Check it out. It's LAPD. What's an LA cop doing way out here?
KYLE: I'm from Nevada, man.
BOB: Give me the shotgun.
CHARLIE: Oh, thank God, the police!
JEEP: Charlie, wait!
MICHAEL: Charlie freezes a few feet from the car when she sees those piercing eyes already familiar to us. Michael looks at her, as if she was exactly who he expected to see. In moments Bob, Kyle and Jeep form a protective shield in front of Charlie. Bob raises the shotgun.
BOB: Take one step closer and I'll drop you right here.
MICHAEL: That how you greet all your Mister, after what we've been through here today, you're lucky we didn't shoot you first and greet you later. Now let me see your
BOB: Mister, after what we've been through here today, you're lucky we didn't shoot you first and greet you later. Now let me see your
BOB: Your teeth goddamn it! Lemme see
JEEP: No, shark teeth, Pop.
BOB: Okay. Suppose you tell us your name then.
MICHAEL: Sorry about all that, Michael. This old lady just went crazy inside my place here. She had these teeth. Never seen anything like `em. Practically bit a man in
BOB: Sorry about all that, Michael. This old lady just went crazy inside my place here. She had these teeth. Never seen anything like `em. Practically bit a man in
BOB: So what are you doin' out here? Gotta say you don't exactly look like a police officer. Even one from L.A. Then again, you have to be, right? I mean, who the hell'd be crazy enough to steal a cop car?
MICHAEL: You don't know, do you?
KYLE: Know what?
CHARLIE: We don't know anything. Nothing's working here. The TV, the radio, the phone.
MICHAEL: I'm running out of time.
BOB: Back off, fella.
KYLE: Easy! Easy!
JEEP: C'mon, Dad, tell `em you're sorry. Tell `em you were only kidding!
CHARLIE: Let `em go!
PERCY: Now, son, I'm sure you don't wanna go spillin' blood for no good reason in front of all these decent people, do ya? Our friend Bob here ain't worth the trouble it'd cause So whaddya say `bout just lettin' `im go and then you can be on your way? Nice `n' easy.
KYLE: What the?
MICHAEL: They're here. You're going to need this.
MICHAEL: You're going to need this.
PERCY: Lord, have mercy.
SANDRA ): You ladies best get back inside.
SANDRA: What is it? What's happening? Who is this man? Why's he driving a police car?
AUDREY: Shut up, mom!
BOB: Wait. I don't think that's such a good idea.
JEEP: Dad, I can handle it.
BOB: ( to Michael ) He's just a kid
JEEP: I said, I can handle it!
MICHAEL: He can handle it. He doesn't have a choice.
MICHAEL: If you want to live, you'll do exactly as I say.
MICHAEL: When you fire, you keep your thumb off the slide. Don't hesitate. Don't do anything brave. There's no safety.
BOB: C'mon, Jeep. We gotta go!
JEEP: Fuck it.
HOWARD: Sandra? What's happening?
SANDRA: It's okay! Everything's okay!
KYLE: Where the hell did they go?
BOB: Alright, Rambo. You got us up here. Now you mind explaining what the fuck we're fighting?
PERCY: Over the wind, another sound becomes audible. The delicate chime of a CALLIOPE.
PERCY: You hear what I'm hearing?
BOB: Yeah.The hell is that? It sounds almost like.
PERCY: It sounds almost like.
KYLE: Ice cream.
KYLE: You've got to be fuckin' kidding Alright. There's a safety switch on the side of your gun. Push it all the way down. Two clicks.
MICHAEL: Alright. There's a safety switch on the side of your gun. Push it all the way down. Two clicks.
MICHAEL: Now when this starts, you hold on tight, you hear me? If you don't, you're going to blow your hand off.
PERCY: The fuck y'all lookin' at me for?
HOWARD: Oh, honey, listen. It's the Ice Cream Man.
KYLE: ( WHISPERS ) Ah, he don't look that bad.
KYLE: Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
MICHAEL: Get ready!
KYLE: Is that it?
MICHAEL: Now! Shoot now!
MICHAEL: Spread out! Don't let them get close to the windows!
BOB: Percy tosses him a box of shells. But Bob fumbles the catch and the box slides halfway down the sloped roof.
BOB: With the gun still in one hand, Bob reaches frantically down for the ammo. Stretching. Further.
PERCY: Bob swings the shotgun like a club CRACK! knocking the bitch clear off the roof. But the move has made his slide even faster. He drops the shotgun, trying to hold on, but he can't stop!
PERCY: ( extending his hook ) Grab my hand!
BOB: Percy tosses Bob a Glock. Fortunately this time Bob deftly catches it with his free hand just as the deranged woman pounces on him.
BOB: ( jamming the gun in her
MOUTH ): Fuck off!
BOB: Pull me up!
PERCY: Come on, motherfuckers! Come on!
JEEP: Where is it?!
AUDREY: Mom! Open your eyes!
SANDRA: I can't! I can't!
SANDRA: ( springing after her
HUSBAND ): Howard screams deliriously as he's dragged rapidly through the diner toward the broken front window. He flails about, desperately trying to grab a hold of something. Sandra scrambles after her husband. Reaching for him.
AUDREY: The creature reaches the window. Sandra dives for Howard's outstretched hands. She has him! The creature's progress is abruptly halted at the shattered window. It turns back toward Sandra a shaft of light falling across its face, reveals: A TEENAGE GIRL of about Audrey's age. Her skin is a deathly blue. Her pupils a GHASTLY WHITE.
TEENAGE GIRL: See what you made me do, mother!?
SANDRA: Charlie and Audrey rush to Sandra's side, grabbing Howard's Jeep is right behind them ready to fire at the creature, but with the women in the way, he can't get a clear shot. So he discards the gun and grabs Howard's arms. Howard screams as his body is torturously stretched. A human ON HOWARD'S FEET TWO MORE SETS OF SINEWY MUSCLE AND BONE CLAWS REACH THROUGH THE WINDOW AND GRAB HIS LEGS. Howard's body lurches further out the window.
SANDRA: Howard's torso is almost entirely out the window. Charlie daringly reaches for Howard's belt, desperate to gain ANOTHER DISFIGURED HAND PUNCHES THROUGH THE BLINDS AND LOCKS ONTO CHARLIE'S ARM! Charlie screams as she's yanked painfully toward the window, losing her grip on Howard's belt. Through the broken window, she sees the face of a RAGGEDY LOOKING MAN. He smiles at her like a father coming home to his baby girl.
RAGGEDY MAN: ( SWEETLY ) There you are!
AUDREY: EXT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME The tide is turning. The men seem to have gotten their game on and the dark shapes are starting to pull back.
KYLE: They're running! We got `em!
SANDRA: Let me go! He's alive!
SANDRA: He's alive!
MICHAEL: No. Not anymore.
CHARLIE: ( RECOVERING ) I'm okay. I'm fine.
CHARLIE: I told you not to do anything
MICHAEL: I told you not to do anything
KYLE: We got `em runnin'!
KYLE: Where's Howard? Someone needs to be on the roof.
MICHAEL: Someone needs to be on the roof.
KYLE: I'll go.
BOB: Hold on.
DETERMINED ): You better start talking.
MICHAEL: The first time God lost faith in Man he sent a flood. The second time.he sent what you see
PERCY: You sayin' this is the I'm saying this is an Those things out there are vessels. The Possessed. The weakest willed are the easiest to turn.
MICHAEL: I'm saying this is an Those things out there are vessels. The Possessed. The weakest willed are the easiest to turn.
KYLE: Possessed by what? Demons?
MICHAEL: No.by angels.
PERCY: ( pulls out his bible ) Son, I don't know what bible you been readin', but in my version, the angels are the good guys.
MICHAEL: That's where your book is wrong.
SANDRA: How come you know so much about I know because until last night, I was on their side.
MICHAEL: I know because until last night, I was on their side.
JEEP: You mean you're.
MICHAEL: Not anymore.
BOB: Right and yesterday I was the fuckin' Easter Bunny. You know, fuck this. I don't even believe in That's fine, because He doesn't believe in you either.
MICHAEL: That's fine, because He doesn't believe in you either.
PERCY: C'mon, Bob. Have you looked outside recently? Those aren't exactly our regular customers out How do we know he didn't bring them here himself?
BOB: How do we know he didn't bring them here himself?
CHARLIE: He brings them here and then he saves us from them? You're a genius, Bob.
AUDREY: So you're here to protect us?
MICHAEL: Not you.
CHARLIE: Me?! Why me?!
MICHAEL: Because your child is the only hope humanity has of surviving.
CHARLIE: No way!
CHARLIE: ( STUNNED ) Jesus Christ.
MICHAEL: Jeep stares at Charlie, as if suddenly his entire life is starting to make sense.
JEEP: You're sayin' she's the mother of the Messiah?
BOB: Wait a minute, isn't Mary supposed to be a vi
CHARLIE: Go fuck yourself, Bob!
PERCY: Makes you wonder about Mary.
CHARLIE: ( approaches Michael, panic Look, this is not possible! I'm just a waitress! I'm nobody! I can't give birth to the Savior of ( and finally ) I don't even own a car!
MICHAEL: None of that matters anymore. Either your child lives or Mankind So what, we're supposed to just hold those things off until Mary over there squeezes one out?
KYLE: So what, we're supposed to just hold those things off until Mary over there squeezes one out?
MICHAEL: That's right.
CHARLIE: That can't be. I'm only eight months pregnant.
KYLE: Oh we're fucked. We are so fucked!
SANDRA: How are we supposed to survive here for a month?
MICHAEL: We won't have to.
CHARLIE: It's coming soon, isn't it?
MICHAEL: If you want to live you'll do what I say. This first attack was a test of our strength. The next one will be a test of our weakness.
KYLE: Okay, what's your plan?
MICHAEL: We'll keep watch on the roof in shifts of two. Jeep, go get some tools. We need to close up this window before somebody else goes
PERCY: They're out there. Sons of bitches. I can feel `em.
KYLE: You were in the Army?
PERCY: Navy, two tours. But the second one didn't work out so well, so I didn't get to go back for a third. Suppose that makes me lucky in a way. Served with Bob, you know. That's how I ended up in this What was it like? Being in a war?
KYLE: What was it like? Being in a war?
PERCY: Dark. Like this.
PERCY: So what's with that gun?
KYLE: Your piece. The one you killed grandma with. Don't reckon it's for huntin' buck.
PERCY: Your piece. The one you killed grandma with. Don't reckon it's for huntin' buck.
KYLE: No. I uh keep it for Protection from what?
PERCY: Protection from what?
KYLE: From people.
PERCY: Yeah, people who might try to give me a hard time, you know?
KYLE: Yeah, people who might try to give me a hard time, you know?
PERCY: Just regular people or uh.
KYLE: Yeah, well, no, not regular, regular people.
PERCY: Irregular people then.

KYLE: Exactly. Strictly business.
PERCY: This business of yours. You like
KYLE: Who the fuck are you to be sweatin' me, man? I got my reasons for doin' what I do.
PERCY: When I was a kid my father would sit by my bed every night before I'd go to sleep and he'd say to me, Percy, if you don't wake up tomorrow, if it turns out that today was your last day on earth, would you be proud of what you've done in this life? Cuz if you ain't, then you better start gettin' square.
BOB: On the house.
SANDRA: You hungry?
BOB: You hungry?
SANDRA: Couldn't eat if my life depended on Well I figure just cuz the world's coming to an end, it doesn't mean a man's gotta starve. All I can say is thank heavens they left the gas
BOB: Well I figure just cuz the world's coming to an end, it doesn't mean a man's gotta starve. All I can say is thank heavens they left the gas
SANDRA: Never much cared for beer. Howard's the beer drinker in the
JEEP: What did you do.you know, before you came here.?
MICHAEL: I was a soldier, a general, in His Well, what changed? What made you I was given an order I didn't believe in. He lost faith. I hadn't.
JEEP: Well, what changed? What made you I was given an order I didn't believe in. He lost faith. I hadn't.
MICHAEL: I was given an order I didn't believe in. He lost faith. I hadn't.
JEEP: So what happens to you.after this is over?
MICHAEL: Sometimes we have to face the thing we fear the most in order to be free of it.
MICHAEL: It's almost time for the next
SANDRA: But Howard's not there. And everyone else in the diner is still asleep. The drugs have started to wear off. and her fear is returning.
VOICE: ( a whisper )
SANDRA: Who's there?
VOICE: Sandra spins around. Searching.
SANDRA: Howard? Is that you?
VOICE: Help me. Please.
VOICE: ( from behind the door ) Help me. Sandra.
HOWARD: Help me, please!
SANDRA: Sandra scrambles down off the desk and frantically pushes it away from the door. She's reaching for the dead bolt when Audrey and Kyle appear in the doorway.
AUDREY: Kyle races to restrain Sandra.
SANDRA: Let me go! He's alive!
SANDRA: And that's when the speed ACCELERATES TO NORMAL and the boils covering Howard's body explode spraying streams of dark fluid toward Sandra just at the moment Percy spins around her, shielding her from the spray, which hits him in the back. But he's not stopping. Percy pushes Sandra back into the diner, the door SLAMMING closed behind them. Percy releases Sandra, letting her stumble hysterically into the room. Kyle and Jeep grab her, forcing her to the ground. But she's not fighting anymore. Charlie turns to look at Percy who is still standing with his back to the door, breathing heavily.
CHARLIE: He takes a step forward, then falls to ground. The entire back side of his body is gone. Burned away.
A SHEET: covering a body.
JEEP: We should get back out there.
BOB: Just gimme another minute with him,
SANDRA'S FACE: INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - A SHORT WHILE LATER Michael and Bob are tying Sandra to a chair. Not like it looks like she's capable of going anywhere, but you never Across the diner, Charlie eyes Michael cautiously. Michael never goes for more than a few moments without looking up at her. It's not lecherous. More like a protective father making sure his child hasn't strayed too far. In a booth, Audrey watches, red-eyed, as Michael restrains her mother. Then she returns her attention to Percy's radio. Tuning. Trying to find something, anything in the STATIC.
AUDREY: CLEARER. Yes. It's a VOICE!
AUDREY: Hey! You guys, I think I got something here!
RADIO VOICE: . battling has been fierce. The numbers of casualties are unknown but all indications are that they must be unimaginably large.
JEEP: Red Rock.
CHARLIE: That can't be more than an hour up the highway from here.
AUDREY: Does that mean we can leave?
MICHAEL: No. We're not going anywhere.
BOB: What the hell are you talkin' about? This is our chance!
MICHAEL: We can't risk being on the move when the child comes. It's too
RADIO VOICE: . And as we fight this new enemy, may God give us the strength to survive and show mercy for those of us who are already lost.
A CIGARETTE: being lit.
CHARLIE: Jeep sees the strain on her face.
JEEP: You okay?
CHARLIE: You mean besides the fact that I just found out that I'm the mother of the Messiah?
CHARLIE: Crazy thing is.I didn't want this baby. I even went down to the clinic, you know that? I remember sitting there in the waiting room, absolutely sure I was doin' the right thing.And that's when the feeling started. Like I was falling into the deepest, darkest hole imaginable. I couldn't breathe, I couldn't speak. I kept thinking this must be what death is like. And when finally they called my name, I ran.
JEEP: You shouldn't say things like that, Charlie. It isn't right. You'll get through this. I know you will.
CHARLIE: How come you have so much faith in me, Jeep? God knows I've never given you or anybody else a reason to. Or is it that you just can't find any other hard-luck case to follow around?
JEEP: You know, you're not the only who's suffered, okay? Let me know when you stop feeling sorry for
KYLE: .Then you just flip this
AUDREY: Yeah, I got it. All the way down. Two clicks.
AUDREY: Dated this guy last summer. A marine. Had a thing for guns. Parents hated him.
KYLE: I bet they did. My parents hate everything I do. That's why we were moving.
AUDREY: My parents hate everything I do. That's why we were moving.
KYLE: They thought a more "wholesome" environment would help me "change my ways." So fucked up. Only reason they care at all is cuz they don't want to be embarrassed in front of their friends at the country club.
AUDREY: They thought a more "wholesome" environment would help me "change my ways." So fucked up. Only reason they care at all is cuz they don't want to be embarrassed in front of their friends at the country club.
KYLE: The only time my old man ever paid attention to me was when I was doing somethin' bad. So you know what I did?
AUDREY: I got really good at being bad.
KYLE: I got really good at being bad.
BOB: We back in business?
MICHAEL: I don't think so.
AUDREY: Is it over?
KYLE: I don't know.
KYLE: ( raising his gun ) You better get downstairs.
AUDREY: No, I can handle it.
KYLE: ( handing her the gun ) Just in case.
KYLE: Get ready.
KYLE: ( lowering his gun ) Wait a minute.
AUDREY: Kyle, are they.
KYLE: It's a trap. They saw them coming and turned on the lights. It's a fucking trap!
AUDREY: They're not gonna make it.
AUDREY: ( pushing his barrel down ) Wait! You'll hit them too!
AUDREY: Kyle charges the dark mob. Creatures peel away from the woman and boy to confront Kyle head-on. He lets loose with a rain of bullets, eviscerating everything that comes at him.
BOB: Jesus Christ, what the hell is that boy doin'!
CHARLIE: We have to get `im back in here!
MICHAEL: Don't. You open that door and we could all be dead.
KYLE: I got you!
YOUNG BOY: ( WHISPERS ) Fooled ya.
AUDREY: INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME Bob kicks over a table in disgust.
BOB: Damn it all to hell!
CHARLIE: Oh, no. Audrey.
YOUNG BOY: I'm sorry! I didn't mean to!
AUDREY: Fuck you!
YOUNG BOY: You're gonna die now.
CHARLIE: Do you have no heart?! She's just a kid!
CHARLIE: You can't let her die!
TABLE ): I swear if you don't do something, I will!
MICHAEL: Charlie looks back at him, defiant. No one breathes. Then:
MICHAEL: ( raising his guns ) Open the door.
MICHAEL: Come with me.
MICHAEL: And together they run toward the open diner door.
THEM!: INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS Everyone's eyes go wide at the insanity they're witnessing. Audrey is the first one in. Michael is almost there. But the fire is faster, ENGULFING
CHARLIE: ( pulling Charlie away from Get back!
BOB: ( pulling Charlie away from Get back!
CHARLIE: I'll get some water!
YOUNG BOY: C'mon, don't be scared. I just wanna play with your baby.
MICHAEL: Are you hurt?
CHARLIE: Where is he?!
JEEP'S VOICE: He's still in here!
BOB'S VOICE: Where the fuck is he?!
JEEP: He's bleeding!
BOB: What the fuck?
JEEP: Jeep can't get a clear shot. Bob's gasping for air. Michael grabs the boy and fiercely rips him off of Bob's back. He swings the boy around like a living shot put.
MICHAEL: Get ready!
CHARLIE: Oh, no!
AUDREY: What am I supposed to do? Just `cause I'm a girl doesn't mean I automatically know how to do this!
MICHAEL: Just do as I say.
AUDREY: Yeah, but, how do you know how to do this?!
BOB: What a way to bring a child into the world. She ever tell you his name?
JEEP: She's never said. I just assumed it was Joe Danvers. You know how she's always had a thing for bad
BOB: Jeep, sooner or later she'll realize you're the best thing that's ever happened to her.
JEEP: I thought you said I should move Can't a father be wrong sometimes?
BOB: Can't a father be wrong sometimes?
JEEP: What was that.?
AUDREY: What is that?!
MICHAEL: He's coming. We have to hurry.
AUDREY: Who's coming? Whaddya mean hurry? This isn't something you can exactly hurry, is it?
MICHAEL: Charlie, I need you to push. I need you to push as hard as you Michael, who's coming?!
AUDREY: Michael, who's coming?!
MICHAEL: We're almost there.
JEEP: We're not gonna make it outta here, are we?
BOB: I'm sorry Jeep. This shouldn't be happening to you.
AUDREY: Oh my god.we did it! Charlie, you did it!
AUDREY: ( CONFUSED ) It's okay. The baby's okay.
CHARLIE: I don't.I.
MICHAEL: Take him. Give her a minute.
AUDREY: It's okay.It's okay.Shhh.
CHARLIE: So are we safe now? Is it over?
MICHAEL: No. Killing the child would have ended the war before it had begun. Now, at least, he will have a chance to grow up, a chance to lead the world out of darkness.
CHARLIE: And what happens until then.?
MICHAEL: You'll need to teach him how.
CHARLIE: What makes you think I can do that? What makes you think I want to do that? If he's so important, why don't you take him?
MICHAEL: Each of us has a burden. This one is yours and yours alone. Maybe someday you'll understand what that
AUDREY: Mama? Can you hear me? We did it.The baby's alive.
JEEP: Something's happening. They're moving away.
MICHAEL: The Possessed can't come near the child, so He sent someone that can. Someone like me.
BOB: Gabriel. My lieutenant. He's come to do what I wouldn't.
MICHAEL: Gabriel. My lieutenant. He's come to do what I wouldn't.
JEEP: Your orders.
JEEP: You were the one who was supposed to kill the baby? That was the order you didn't obey.
CHARLIE: What's he talking about?
CHARLIE: Michael, what the hell's he talking There was never meant to be a Second Coming. But we've just changed that. The child lives. The future is unwritten. There's still hope.
MICHAEL: There was never meant to be a Second Coming. But we've just changed that. The child lives. The future is unwritten. There's still hope.
CHARLIE: Audrey moves to hand over the baby to Charlie.
SANDRA: Stay away from me! Don't come any Don't do it, lady!
AUDREY: Don't do it, lady!
BOB: Don't do it, lady!
SANDRA: You heard what he said. They just want the baby. Maybe if we just give it to them, then they'll let us go!
CHARLIE: Give him to me!
SANDRA: Why?! You never wanted him in the first place!
CHARLIE: No. I.
SANDRA: It's just one baby. Just one.
JEEP: With a sweep of his hand, Gabriel sends Bob flying across the diner where he crashes down behind the counter near the Michael GRABS JEEP'S HAND before the boy can rush back into the fray.
MICHAEL: No, Jeep! You must protect the child now!
JEEP: Me?! What about you?
MICHAEL: My path ends here. You are the true protector. You always have
JEEP: But I don't know what to do!
MICHAEL: Find the Prophets. Learn to read the instructions.
JEEP: Prophets? What Prophets? What
JEEP: Charlie looks past Jeep to see Michael returning to the fray.
CHARLIE: Wait! We can't leave him!
JEEP: We have no choice! We have to get to Red Rock!
JEEP: Jeep tries to help him up.
BOB: Leave me, Jeep. My place is here, But Dad.!
JEEP: But Dad.!
BOB: And so Jeep, fighting back tears, does what his father says.
MICHAEL: I knew he'd send you, Gabriel. You were always so eager to please Him.
GABRIEL: Unlike you.the rebellious son. Pity about your wings. They would have helped you now.
MICHAEL: To not feel their burden.is a You think you can defy Him and not pay the price?
GABRIEL: You think you can defy Him and not pay the price?
MICHAEL: The child lives. What happens to me doesn't matter now.
GABRIEL: Yours is a fool's sacrifice. You can help them sneak out the back door, but they won't escape.
MICHAEL: ( SOFT ) I'm not running anymore.
MICHAEL: ( SENSING ) Join with me. You don't need do this. There's another way.
GABRIEL: There is no other way.
CHARLIE: Come on, Jeep!
JEEP: I'm trying!
JEEP: Jeep pumps the gas and the ENGINE BURSTS TO LIFE! The creature's about to punch a fist through the glass
JEEP: ( throwing the car in
REVERSE ): Hang on!
JEEP: Okay, we need to figure out our weapon situation. Hopefully Michael didn't take everything out of the car.
CHARLIE: Is this what I think it is?
JEEP: Yes. Now just put it down.
AUDREY: ( holding up each item ) Okay, all I got is a flare gun thing. Looks like we got a box of flares to go with it.
JEEP: Okay. Okay. Handgun. Shotgun. A a flare gun. And a grenade. Load this.
AUDREY: I can try.
JEEP: Try real hard, okay?

JEEP: I can't fuckin' see!
JEEP: Oh, no.

AUDREY: I can't believe it. Is it really
JEEP: No.It's just starting.
JEEP: Better not hold him too long. Might get attached.
CHARLIE: Look, I'm sorry for what I said to you earlier, `bout you following me around. I didn't mean it.
JEEP: Nothin' to be sorry about. It's true. I did follow you around. At least now I know there was a good
AUDREY: We're here.
MILES": Okay, all we gotta do is
JEEP: Okay, all we gotta do is
CRASH!: The roof buckles above them. The windows BLOW OUT.
FORCE!: USING HIS MIGHTY WINGS FOR BALANCE HE BEGINS TO STOMP ON THE ROOF, CRUSHING IT DOWN AS IF IT WERE A SODA CAN! INT. POLICE CRUISER - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS Jeep, Charlie and Audrey slip frantically down in their seats as the roof presses down at them. The windows BURST. Jeep grabs the Glock and fires wildly up at the roof.
AUDREY: Jeep swings the gun around.
JEEP: BLAM! Gabriel takes one in the shoulder, but it doesn't slow him down.
JEEP: Audrey, the flare gun!
JEEP: Get down on the floor!
AUDREY: Do it, Jeep! Do it now!
CHARLIE: C'mon, Jeep!
CHARLIE: She kicks open her door and begins pulling him out.
JEEP: The baby?
CHARLIE: And what about.
JEEP: And what about.
CHARLIE: Nothing could have survived that.
JEEP: ( ANGUISHED ) She saved us, Jeep. Audrey saved us. Now c'mon, we gotta go!
CHARLIE: She saved us, Jeep. Audrey saved us. Now c'mon, we gotta go!
CHARLIE: How can this happen?
JEEP: How can this happen in a world so
CHARLIE: How can this happen in a world so
JEEP: C'mon, we're almost there.
GABRIEL: So brave. So pointless. You should have worried more about saving yourself.
CHARLIE: Stop! Please! Don't kill him!
GABRIEL: Go to sleep.
CHARLIE: Stop it! I'LL GIVE YOU THE BABY! I don't want this responsibility!
CHARLIE: I don't want this responsibility!
JEEP: Charlie, no!
GABRIEL: "And as the child's cries are extinguished, an eternal darkness at last descended upon the world."
KABOOM!: GABRIEL IS BLOWN TO BLOODY BITS. The creature is gone at last. The sound of a BABY COOING. Charlie picks the child up out of the brush. She helps Jeep to his feet and together they slowly make their way to the top of the ridge.
JEEP: We made it.
CHARLIE: Yep, we sure did.
JEEP: I'm sure they're just over the next
CHARLIE: What if we're on our own now?
JEEP: Don't be afraid. We'll be okay.
CHARLIE'S VOICE: Someday when my son is older, I will tell him about the time of his birth when all the world was covered in a great darkness.
CHARLIE'S VOICE: . And how just at the moment when everything seemed lost.
