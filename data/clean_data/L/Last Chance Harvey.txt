KATE: She means well. She's just had a tough run. My Father ran off to France with his secretary. Then mum got cancer, about four years ago now. She's fully recovered. But won't admit She's basically bored. And my continued `situation' as she calls it, being single, is her major distraction. Her pastime if you I see.
