CARS 2: WRITTEN BY BEN QUEEN LELAND TURBO LELAND TURBO
WRITTEN BY: BEN QUEEN LELAND TURBO LELAND TURBO
BEN QUEEN: A sleek British sports car talks directly to us in a pixilated, garbled video. He's OUT OF BREATH. Crates are visible behind him. We're in the shadowy bowels of a steel SUPERIMPOSE OVER BLACK: WALT DISNEY PICTURES PRESENTS
LELAND TURBO: This is Agent Leland Turbo. I have a flash transmission for Agent Finn SUPERIMPOSE OVER BLACK: WALT DISNEY PICTURES PRESENTS Finn. My cover's been compromised. Everything's gone pear-shaped.
LELAND TURBO: Finn. My cover's been compromised. Everything's gone pear-shaped.
LELAND TURBO: You won't believe what I've found out here. He angles our camera view, reveals a PORTHOLE through which we can see flames rising in the distance.
LELAND TURBO: This is bigger than anything we've ever seen. And no one even knows it exists. Finn, I need backup. But don't call the cavalry - it could blow the operation. And be careful. It's not safe out here! ANGRY VOICES O.S. Time for Turbo to go.
LELAND TURBO: Transmitting my grids now. Good Coordinates appear: 40 6.80' N - 172 23.84' W
CRABBY: Alright buddy, we're here. Right where you paid me to bring you. Question is, why? A metallic blue sports car, circa the `60s, emerges from the
FINN: I'm looking for a car.
CRABBY: A car? Hey pal, you can't get any further away from land than out Exactly where I want to be.
FINN: Exactly where I want to be.
CRABBY: Well I got news for you, buddy. There's nobody out here but us. Suddenly, a HORN a COMBAT SHIP, the size of most cruise ships. FINN quickly backs into the shadows, out of sight.
COMBAT SHIP: What are you doing out here?
CRABBY: What does it look like, genius? I'm Well turn around and go back where you came from.
COMBAT SHIP: Well turn around and go back where you came from.
CRABBY: Yeah? And who's gonna make me? A laser sight hits Crabby between the eyes.
CRABBY: Alright, alright! Don't get your prop in a twist. ( as he turns to leave ) What a jerk. Sorry, buddy. Looks like it's the end of the line. ON CRABBY'S DECK: Finn is gone.
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: ( in German and English ) Too many cars here. Out of my way!
FINN: Professor Zundapp?
NOSY PACER: You wanted to see this before we load it?
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: Ah, yes. Very carefully. A forklift opens the crate inside is a TV CAMERA, packed carefully in foam. Finn SNAPS PHOTOS FURIOUSLY.
NOSY PACER: Oh. A TV camera. What does it actually do?
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: This camera is extremely dangerous.
FINN: ( TO HIMSELF )
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: This is valuable equipment. Make sure it is properly secured for the You got it. Finn LOWERS HIMSELF. He snaps more pictures.
NOSY PACER: You got it. Finn LOWERS HIMSELF. He snaps more pictures.
GREM: This is one of those British spies we told you about.
ACER: Yeah. This one we caught sticking his bumper where it didn't belong. Finn PRODUCES SEMI-AUTOMATIC GUNS from his side, readies himself for a tag-team spy fight with his buddy Leland.
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: Agent Leland Turbo. The crate is lifted, revealing a CRUSHED, CUBED Leland Turbo. Finn's eyes go wide. Suddenly - WHOOOSHHH! Another derrick flame rises behind him, casts a Finn-shaped SHADOW over the Professor. He looks up.
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: It's Finn McMissile! He's seen the camera! Kill him!! Finn UNLOADS with bullets as he starts to retreat - He
GREM: ( NONPLUSSED )
ACER: He's getting away!
COMBAT SHIP: Not for long. The LEAD COMBAT SHIP quietly drops a TORPEDO into the water. It skips along, connecting with Finn in his rear and EXPLODING with such force that water skyrockets into the night clouds. UNDERWATER - McMissile SINKS. Then, he blinks. He GRINS. We're starting to like this grin and what follows it. He now CONVERTS into a submarine. From his trunk he releases four DECOY tires which float to the surface like body parts. ON THE DERRICK - Professor Zundapp watches it all from far GREM ( OVER RADIO ) He's dead, Professor.
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: Wunderbar. With Finn McMissile gone, who can stop us now?
MATER: Mater. Tow Mater, that's who. is here to help you! He approaches a broken-down sedan on the side of the road. He drives around to the front, catching OTIS' face for the first Hey, Otis!
MATER: Hey, Otis!
OTIS: Hey, Mater. Gosh, I'm so sorry. I thought I could make it this time, ( he tries to start his engine, stalls ) Smooth like pudding, huh? Ah, who am I kidding? I'll always be a Mater hooks his friend and starts towing him.
MATER: Well dadgum, you're leaking oil again. Must be your gaskets. Hey, look on the bright side: This is your tenth tow this month, so that means it's on the house.
OTIS: You're the only one that's nice to lemons like me, Mater.
MATER: Don't sweat it. These things happen to everybody, Otis.
OTIS: But you never leak oil.
MATER: Yeah, but I ain't perfect. Don't tell nobody, but I think my rust is starting to show through. Mater and Otis drive past THE RADIATOR SPRINGS WELCOME SIGN. It has been amended to say: "Home of Lightning McQueen."
OTIS: Hey, is Lightning McQueen back yet?
MATER: Not yet.
OTIS: He must be crazy-excited about winning his fourth Piston Cup. Four! Wow!
MATER: Yeah, we're so dadgum proud of him. But I sure wish he'd hurry up and get back `cause we got a whole summer's worth of best friend fun to make up for. Just me and Ahead of them, a half-mile off, a RED RACE CAR is visible.
MATER: - McQueen! Mater FLOORS IT, dragging poor Otis behind him.
OTIS: Uh, Mater? I'm in no hurry. You don't need to go so fast! Boom! They hit a bump. Otis catches air.
LUIGI: Oh, Lightning. Welcome home.
FLO: Good to have you back, honey.
FILLMORE: Congratulations, man.
SARGE: Welcome home, soldier.
SHERIFF: The place wasn't the same without you, son.
LIZZIE: What? Did he go somewhere?
MCQUEEN: It's good to be home, everybody.
MCQUEEN: Mater skids into main street and in one swift motion, slingshots Otis forward -
MATER: Mater skids into main street and in one swift motion, slingshots Otis forward -
OTIS: - right through Ramone's front door -
RAMONE: Hey. How far'd you make it this time, Otis?
OTIS: Halfway to the county line.
RAMONE: Not bad, man.
OTIS: I know, I can't believe it either!
MATER: McQueen, welcome back!
MCQUEEN: Mater, it's so good to see you.
MATER: You too, buddy. Mater and McQueen do an ELABORATE TIRE BUMP ( fist bump style ).
MATER: Oh, man. You ain't gonna believe the things I got planned for us. Everyone watches as the tire bump continues.
MACK: ( to Lizzie, an aside ) These best friend greetings get longer every year.
MATER: ( TO MCQUEEN )
MCQUEEN: Well, actually I've got something to show you first.
MATER: Wow. I can't believe they renamed the Piston Cup after our very own Doc Hudson. McQueen and Mater are alone, the museum closed to the public. McQueen approaches a "Hudson Hornet" wall with Doc's three Piston cups, framed articles, other racing ephemera.
MCQUEEN: I know Doc said these things were just old cups, but to have someone else win it just didn't feel right, you know?
MATER: Well, Doc would've been real proud of you. That's for sure. McQueen takes this in.
MCQUEEN: Alright, pal. I've been waiting all summer for this. What've you got You sure you can handle it?
MATER: You sure you can handle it?
MCQUEEN: Come on, you know who you're talking to? This is Lightning McQueen. I can handle anything.
MCQUEEN: Uh.. Mater?!
MATER: Just remember, your brakes ain't gonna work on these! As they head INTO A DARK TUNNEL -
MCQUEEN: Come on, come on! Faster, faster! Moments later a harmless GALLOPING GOOSE appears, oversized horn visible, cackling and laughing at his prank.
MATER: This is gonna be good! They blow their horns and he TIPS OVER, tractor-tipping style. They LAUGH at the gag, but soon realize the earth mover's GIANT EXHAUST PIPE is directly above them.
MATER: Uh-oh. This ain't gonna be good. The exhaust pipe BELCHES. McQueen and Mater are BLASTED out of view.
MATER: Boy, this was the best day ever! And my favorite souvenir? Mater proudly shows off a dent.
MATER: This new dent!
MCQUEEN: Boy, Mater. Today was, uh.
MATER: Shoot, that was nothing. Wait til you see what I got planned for Mater, Mater. Whoa. I was kind of thinking of just a quiet dinner.
MCQUEEN: Mater, Mater. Whoa. I was kind of thinking of just a quiet dinner.
MATER: That's exactly what I was thinking.
MCQUEEN: No, I. I meant with Sally, Mater.
MATER: Even better! You, me and Miss Sally going out for supper. McQueen pulls around in front of Mater, stops.
MCQUEEN: Mater, I meant it would be just me and Sally.
MATER: It's just for tonight. We'll do whatever you want tomorrow.
MCQUEEN: It's just for tonight. We'll do whatever you want tomorrow.
MATER: ( DISAPPOINTED )
MCQUEEN: Thanks for understanding.
MATER: Yeah, sure. Y'all go on and have fun now.
MCQUEEN: Alright, then. See ya soon, amigo! McQueen drives off. Mater watches him go.
SALLY: This is so nice.
MCQUEEN: I can't tell you how good it is to be here alone. Just the two of us. Finally, you and me -
MATER: My name is Mater and I'll be your Mater the waiter. That's funny right there.
MCQUEEN: Mater, you work here?
MATER: Well yeah I work here. What'd you think, I just snuck in here when nobody was looking and pretended to be your waiter, just so I could hang out with you? McQueen and Sally exchange a look.
MCQUEEN: Oh, yeah. How ridiculous would that Now, can I start you two lovebirds off with a couple drinks?
MATER: Now, can I start you two lovebirds off with a couple drinks?
MCQUEEN: Yes. I'll have my usual.
SALLY: You know what? I'm going to have that too. Mater blinks.
MATER: Uh, right. Your usual.
MATER: Guido! What's McQueen's usual?
GUIDO: ( in Italian, subtitled ) How should I know?
MATER: Perfect! Give me two of `em.
SARGE: Quiet! My program's on.
MATER: ( TO FILLMORE )
SARGE: FRANCESCO ( ON TV ) If he is, how you say "the bestest race car," then why must he rest, MATER'S VOICE ( ON TV ) Cause he knows what's important. Every now and then he prefers just to slow down, enjoy life.
MCQUEEN: Hey, what's going on over there?
MCQUEEN: ( TO SALLY )
SALLY: Francesco Bernoulli. No wonder there's a crowd. When Sally says his name, she enunciates each part, as if Italian were her mother's tongue.
MCQUEEN: Wait, why do you know his name? And don't say it like that. It's three syllables, not ten.
SALLY: What? He's nice to look at. You know, open-wheeled and all.
MCQUEEN: What's wrong with fenders? I thought you like my fenders.
MCQUEEN: MATER'S VOICE ( ON TV ) McQueen could drive circles around FRANCESCO ( ON TV ) Driving in circles is all he can do, no?
MATER: Ha ha! That shows what you know. Dump trucks is dumb. Suddenly, Mater is YANKED from the booth and replaced by MCQUEEN ( INTO PHONE ) Yeah, hi, this is Lightning McQueen. Look, I don't appreciate my best friend being insulted like FRANCESCO ( ON TV ) McQueen! That was your best friend? This is the difference between you and Francesco. Francesco knows how good he is. He does not need to surround himself with tow trucks to prove it.
MCQUEEN: Those are strong words from a car that is so fragile.
MCQUEEN: "Not so fast." What is that, your new motto? Francesco goes ballistic in Italian. They cut his mic.
MCQUEEN: Well, I would love to. The only thing is my crew's off for the season so - A sound O.S. McQueen turns to see Fillmore, Sarge and Luigi flank a tablecloth which is hanging off the bar. Ramone backs away, having spray painted "TEAM LIGHTNING MCQUEEN" on it. Guido quickly uncorks three wine bottles.
GUIDO: Pit stop. McQueen turns back to the phone.
MCQUEEN: You know what? They just got back. Deal me in, baby. Ka-chow! The place ERUPTS IN CHEERS. MOMENTS LATER - General excitement as McQueen exits the phone booth where Sally waits. Off her look:
MCQUEEN: I know, I know. I just got back. But we won't be long and -
SALLY: Oh, no, don't worry about me. I've got enough to do here. Mater's going to have a blast though. ( off McQueen's silence ) You're bringing Mater, right? You never bring him to any of your McQueen turns to the bar where Mater privately tries their drinks, hates it, spits it back in the glass.
SALLY: Just let him sit in the pits, give him a headset. C'mon, it'll be a thrill of a lifetime for him. Mater arrives.
MATER: Your drinks, sir.
MCQUEEN: I didn't taste it!
MATER: I didn't taste it!
MCQUEEN: How'd you like to come and see the world with me?
MATER: You mean it?
MCQUEEN: You got me into this thing. You're coming along.
LUIGI: Guido, look! Ferraris and tires! Let's go!
MCQUEEN: ( IMPRESSED )
MATER: You got it, buddy. Hey, what's He sees something, peels away.
MCQUEEN: LEWIS HAMILTON
LEWIS HAMILTON: Hey, McQueen, over here!
MCQUEEN: Hey, Jeff. Lewis!
MATER: Hey! You done good! You got all the People turn at the noise he's making.
JEFF GORVETTE: Check out that tow truck.
LEWIS HAMILTON: I wonder who that guy's with?
MCQUEEN: Will you guys excuse me just for one little second? He zips over to Mater's side, quickly pulls him out of sight.
MCQUEEN: Mater, listen. This isn't Radiator You're just realizing that? Boy, that jet-lag really done a number on you.
MATER: You're just realizing that? Boy, that jet-lag really done a number on you.
MCQUEEN: Mater, look things are different over here. Which means maybe you should, you know, act a little different too.
MATER: Different than what?
MCQUEEN: Well, just. help me out here, buddy. I -
MATER: You need help? Shoot, why didn't you just say so? That's what a tow truck does. Hey, looky there, it's Mr. San Francisco! FRANCESCO is visible across the room, holding court.
MATER: I'll introduce you.
MCQUEEN: Mater, no.
MATER: ( already on his way ) Look at me I'm helping you On FRANCESCO - MOMENTS LATER. Mater approaches, giddy.
MATER: Hey Mr. San Francisco, I'd like you to meet -
FRANCESCO: Lightning McQueen! Buona sera.
MCQUEEN: Nice to meet you, Francesco.
FRANCESCO: Yeah, nice to meet you too. You are very good-looking. Not as good as I thought, but you're good.
MATER: ( TO FRANCESCO )
FRANCESCO: Anything for McQueen's friend. As Mater poses for a photo with Francesco:
MATER: Miss Sally is gonna flip when she sees this. She's Lightning McQueen's girlfriend.
FRANCESCO: She's a big fan of yours.
MATER: She's a big fan of yours.
FRANCESCO: Hey, she has good taste.
MCQUEEN: Mater's prone to exaggeration. I wouldn't say she's a "big" fan.
MATER: You're right. She's a huge fan. She goes on and on about your open wheels here.
MCQUEEN: Mentioning it once doesn't qualify as going "on and on."
FRANCESCO: Francesco is familiar with this reaction to Francesco. Women respect a car that has nothing to Yeah, uh.
MCQUEEN: Yeah, uh.
FRANCESCO: Let us have a toast. McQueen doesn't like where this is going, covers.
MCQUEEN: ( raising a drink ) I dedicate my win tomorrow. to Miss Sally.
FRANCESCO: ( raising a drink ) I dedicate my win tomorrow. to Miss Sally.
MCQUEEN: Oh, sorry. I already dedicated MY win tomorrow to her. So if we both do it, it's really not so special. Besides, I don't have a drink.
MATER: I'll go get you one. You mind if I borrow a few bucks for one of them ( could kill him ) They're free, Mater.
MCQUEEN: ( could kill him ) They're free, Mater.
MATER: Free? Well, shoot, what am I doing Mater ZIPS OFF.
MCQUEEN: I should probably go keep an eye on him. See you at the race. McQueen starts to leave.
FRANCESCO: Yes, you will see Francesco. But not like this. Francesco does a 180, so his rear end now faces McQueen.
FRANCESCO: You will see him like this, as he drives away from you. Francesco wears a bumper sticker that says "Ciao, McQueen!"
MCQUEEN: That's cute. So you had one of those made up for all the racers?
FRANCESCO: He rolls off.
MCQUEEN: He rolls off.
MCQUEEN: He is so getting beat tomorrow.
VOICE: Ladies and gentlecars. Sir Miles MILES AXLEROD drives through an infinity fountain, appears.
MILES AXLEROD: It is my absolute honor to introduce to you the competitors in the first-ever World Grand Prix. From Brazil. Number eight. ON FINN MCMISSILE. He appears from the shadows, keeps a careful distance from the stage. He ZEROES HIS GAZE ON - - THE WORLD GRAND PRIX TV CAMERAS which roll, catching Miles Axlerod's speech for publicity and posterity. Finn's ONBOARD COMPUTER ANALYZES each one, compares to the photos we saw him snap on the oil platform. Each one is "NOT A MATCH." His view is suddenly disrupted by A BEAUTIFUL SPORTS CAR. She approaches Finn. Meet HOLLEY SHIFTWELL.
HOLLEY: A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no That's because it's air-cooled.
FINN: That's because it's air-cooled.
HOLLEY: I'm Agent Shiftwell, Holley Shiftwell from the Tokyo Station. I have a message from London.
FINN: Not here.
FINN: So the lab boys analyzed the photo I sent? What did they learn about the camera?
HOLLEY: It appears to be a standard television camera. They said if you could get closer photos next time, that would be great.
FINN: This was London's message?
HOLLEY: Oh no, no. No sir. Um, the oil platforms you were on? Turns out they're sitting on the biggest oil reserve in the world.
FINN: How did we miss that?
HOLLEY: They'd been scrambling everyone's satellites. The Americans actually discovered it just before you did. They placed an agent on that platform, under deep cover. He was able to get a photo of the car who's running the entire operation. The doors OPEN and they exit onto the Mezzanine.
FINN: Who is it? Has anyone seen the photo yet?
HOLLEY: No, not yet. The American is here tonight to pass it to you. He'll signal you when he's ready.
FINN: GOOD -
FINN: Oh no. Professor Zundapp is visible below them. He talks with a few Pacers and Gremlins. Finn quickly retreats into the shadows. Holley follows suit.
HOLLEY: What is it?
FINN: Change of plan. You're meeting the What, me?
HOLLEY: What, me?
FINN: Those thugs down there were on the oil platform. If they see me, the whole mission is compromised.
HOLLEY: No, no. I'm technical, you see. I'm in Diagnostics. I'm not a field You are now.
FINN: You are now.
MATER: I'll take one of them. He snatches it, drops it in the back where we now see a large assortment of drinks balanced.
MATER: Never know which one McQueen'll have a hankering for. He approaches a sushi bar.
MATER: Hey, what you got here that's free? How about that pistachio ice cream? He refers to wasabi, of course.
SUSHI CHEF: No, no. Wasabi.
MATER: Oh, same ol', same ol'. What's up with you? That looks delicious. The chef starts to carve a small scoop aside for Mater.
MATER: Uh, a little more, please. It is free, right? ( the chef adds more ) Keep it coming. A little more. Come on, let's go, it's free! You're getting there. Scoop scoop! The chef gives in. Scoops a baseball-sized ball out.
MATER: There you go. Now THAT's a scoop of ice cream.
SUSHI CHEF: ( in Japanese, subtitles ) My condolences.
MILES AXLEROD: . and now, our last competitor - Number 95, Lightning McQueen! MCQUEEN approaches the microphone, flashes his headlights.
MCQUEEN: Thank you so much for having us, Sir Axlerod. I really look forward to racing. This is a great Oh, the pleasure is all ours, Lightning. You and your team bring excellence and professionalism to this competition. As if on cue, Mater arrives with a piercing scream of pain. Everyone turns as he charges head first toward the stage, making a bee-line for that FOUNTAIN.
MILES AXLEROD: Oh, the pleasure is all ours, Lightning. You and your team bring excellence and professionalism to this competition. As if on cue, Mater arrives with a piercing scream of pain. Everyone turns as he charges head first toward the stage, making a bee-line for that FOUNTAIN.
MATER: Somebody get me water! He laps up water from the fountain like a diabetic cat.
MATER: ( LAPPING WATER )
MATER: ( to the crowd ) Whatever you do, do not eat the free pistachio ice cream. It has Sir Axlerod, I can explain. This is I know him. This is the bloke that called into the television show.
MCQUEEN: Sir Axlerod, I can explain. This is I know him. This is the bloke that called into the television show.
MILES AXLEROD: I know him. This is the bloke that called into the television show.
MATER: No, thank you. This trip's been He's a little excited, isn't he? TILT DOWN to reveal a pool of oil beneath Mater.
MILES AXLEROD: ( TO MCQUEEN )
MCQUEEN: But wait, I. oh, shoot. McQueen quickly pulls Mater aside, out of earshot of Miles Axlerod and the others. McQueen is beside himself.
MATER: But wait, I. oh, shoot. McQueen quickly pulls Mater aside, out of earshot of Miles Axlerod and the others. McQueen is beside himself.
MCQUEEN: Mater, you have to get a hold of yourself. You're making a scene.
MATER: But I never leak oil. Never.
MCQUEEN: Go take care of yourself right now. Mater drives off.
MATER: Coming through! Excuse me, leakin' oil. Where's the bathroom? Thank you. I gotta go! Someone points Mater down a hallway. He whips around the
MATER: ( CONFUSED )
MATER: Sorry ladies! He heads into the other door -
MATER: I never leak I never leak I never He sees someone leaving a stall. He heads in. IN THE STALL - Mater enters, looks up.
MATER: The stall is a complicated apparatus with buttons and lights. High-tech Japanese. It suddenly GRABS MATER, hoists him up as if he's going to get an oil change.
MATER: What in the- A Japanese style cartoon CARICATURE appears on a TV MONITOR, followed by images of waterfalls and rivers.
MATER: ( GIGGLING )
ROD REDLINE: Okay, McMissile. I'm here. It's time for the drop.
HOLLEY: Oh, you've got to be joking.
FINN: What's the problem, Shiftwell?
HOLLEY: He's in the loo.
FINN: So go in!
HOLLEY: I can't just go into the men's loo.
FINN: Time is of the essence, Shiftwell.
MATER: ( out of breath ) Whatever you do, I would not go in The door SWINGS shut, revealing the pulverized Acer.
MATER: A Gremlin and a Pacer! Rod Redline, now behind Mater and sensing an opportunity here, quickly produces A SMALL DEVICE.
MATER: ( to Grem and Acer ) No offense to your makes and models, but you guys break down harder than my cousin Betsy after she got left at the - Rod Redline, surreptitiously attaches the device to Mater's ( as he's goosed ) - altar! He spins around, sees Rod Redline for the first time.
MATER: ( as he's goosed ) - altar! He spins around, sees Rod Redline for the first time.
MATER: Are you okay?
ROD REDLINE: I'm fine.
GREM: Hey. Tow truck. Mater turns back to Grem and Acer.
GREM: We'd like to get to our private business here, if you don't mind.
MATER: Oh, yeah. Don't let me get in the way of your "private business." Oh! A little advice: When you hear her giggle and see that waterfall, you best press that green button.
GREM: Thank you.
MATER: It's to adjust the temperature.
ACER: Got it.
MATER: Remember it's in Celsius, not GREM AND ACER Get outta here!
MATER: Alright then. Mater exits, leaving Rod Redline to a now even angrier Grem and Acer.
MATER: Excuse me, ma'am. He passes her, expelling some exhaust in the process. Holley's rearview tracking confirms that the device is on Dadgum pistachio ice cream.
MATER: ( TO HIMSELF )
MATER: ( driving off, to himself ) Look out, ladies. Mater's fittin' to get funky!
HOLLEY: Well, hello.
MATER: Well, hello.
HOLLEY: A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no Well of course it doesn't. That's `cause it's air-cooled!
MATER: Well of course it doesn't. That's `cause it's air-cooled!
HOLLEY: ( RELIEVED )
MATER: Course, Karmann Ghia's weren't the only ones. Besides the Beetles you had your Type-3 Squarebacks, with the pancake motors.
HOLLEY: Yeah. Okay, I get it-
MATER: . And before both of them, there's the Type-2 buses - my buddy Fillmore's one of them.
HOLLEY: Listen! We should find somewhere more private.
MATER: Uh, gee. Don't you think that's a little, uh -
HOLLEY: ( NERVOUS ENERGY )
MATER: Well, let's see. Tomorrow I'll be out there at the races.
HOLLEY: Got it. We'll rendezvous then.
MCQUEEN: There you are. Where have you been?
MATER: What's a rendezvous?
LUIGI: It's like a date.
MATER: A date?!
MCQUEEN: Mater, what's going on?
MATER: Well, what's going on is I've got me a date tomorrow. Guido makes a crack in Italian.
LUIGI: Guido don't believe you.
MATER: Well, believe it. My new girlfriend just said so. Hey, there she is. Mater points out Holley, who's within earshot.
MATER: ( YELLING )
MATER: See ya tomorrow! Guido makes another crack in Italian.
LUIGI: Guido still don't believe you.
GREM: - you tricked us real good.
ACER: And we don't like being tricked. Rod Redline laughs to himself.
ACER: Hey, what's so funny?
ROD REDLINE: Well, you know, I was just wearing a disguise. You guys are stuck looking like that. This doesn't help him. They DROP HIM onto a TREADMILL, lock him down. A container is wheeled forward and Rod is plied with Allinol brand gasoline.
ROD REDLINE: Allinol? Thanks, fellas. I hear this stuff is good for you.
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: Allinol by itself is good for you. Zundapp hits a button and the TREADMILL starts Rod's wheels spinning at a high rate of speed.
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: But after microscopic examination, I have found that it has one small weakness. When hit with an electromagnetic pulse, it becomes extremely dangerous.
GREM: SMILE -
GREM: - for the camera.
ROD REDLINE: Is that all you want? I got a whole You were very interested in this camera on the oil platform. Now you will witness what it really does.
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: You were very interested in this camera on the oil platform. Now you will witness what it really does.
ROD REDLINE: Whatever you say, Professor. Acer pushes a TV MONITOR toward Rod. On it, surveillance footage from the party. Clearly, they were watching and recording him there.
ACER: You talked up a lot of cars last night. Which one's your associate?
ROD REDLINE: Your mother. Oh no, I'm sorry. It was your sister. You know, I can't tell them apart these days.
GREM: ( HAD ENOUGH )
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: Fifty percent power. ( to Rod Redline ) This camera is actually an electromagnetic pulse emitter.
ACER: ( re: a girl on the TV ) What about her? Did you give it to The Allinol is now heating to a boil, dramatically expanding, causing the engine block to crack under the stress, forcing oil into the combustion chamber. Rod Redline's engine starts to CRACK and BREAK.
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: The Allinol is now heating to a boil, dramatically expanding, causing the engine block to crack under the stress, forcing oil into the combustion chamber. Rod Redline's engine starts to CRACK and BREAK.
ACER: ( re: a guy on the TV ) How about him? You talk to him?
ROD REDLINE: ( to Professor Zundapp ) What do I care? I can replace an engine block.
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: You may be able to, but after full impact of the pulse, unfortunately, there will be nothing to replace.
ACER: How about him? Does he have it? The monitor reveals MATER, rolling out of the bathroom and down the hall. Rod Redline, seeing this, does the world's most subtle double take. We caught it, but there's no way anyone else in the room could have -
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: That's him. He's the one.
GREM: Roger that, Professor Z.
ROD REDLINE: As Grem turns up the machine even MORE, the Professor makes a The Professor hangs up, turns to the room.
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: The project is still on schedule. You will find this second agent - Zundapp kicks the camera's power into the RED.
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: - and kill him. On the MONITOR - With Mater's frozen image on the screen we see Rod EXPLODE in the reflection.
BRENT MUSTANGBURGER: I'm Brent Mustangburger, here with racing legends Darrell Cartrip and David Hobbscap. There's never been a competition like this before. SHOTS OF THE PITS as the racers fuel up.
DAVID HOBBSCAP: Really, Darrell, I think you need to clean your windshield. You're clearly not seeing this for what it is: Francesco's race to lose.
MCQUEEN: ( TO HIMSELF )
FRANCESCO: Really? You are "speed"? Then Francesco is triple speed. ( closes his eyes ) Francesco. Is. Triple speed. Francesco likes this, McQueen. It's really getting him into the zone!
MCQUEEN: He is so getting beat today. The starting lights click down from RED to YELLOW to GREEN. The race begins. Francesco quickly grabs the lead. He's pulling away within seconds.
SARGE: His suspension stats look good.
LUIGI: Tire pressure is excellent.
FILLMORE: He's got plenty of fuel.
MATER: And he's awesome!
HOLLEY: Why is he in the pits? He's so It's his cover. One of the best I've seen, too. Look at the detail on that rust. It must have cost him a fortune.
FINN: It's his cover. One of the best I've seen, too. Look at the detail on that rust. It must have cost him a fortune.
HOLLEY: But why hasn't he contacted us yet?
FINN: There's probably heat on him. Be Right, of course. He'll signal us when he can.
HOLLEY: Right, of course. He'll signal us when he can.
FINN: And then we find out who's behind all this. ON THE TRACK - VARIOUS SHOTS OF THE RACE through Tokyo as Francesco extends his lead and McQueen attempts to make up IN MCQUEEN'S PIT - Mater watches the monitors, sees them approaching the dirt section.
MATER: McQueen! It's time to make your move. Get on the outside and show 'em what Doc done taught you.
MCQUEEN: Nice call, Mater. Keep it up! McQueen now leads the pack, zooming out of the dirt now starting to relax.
GREM: Roger that. ON THE TRACK - A racer ( Miguel Camino ) suddenly PLUMES WITH SMOKE and skids out.
GREM: You gotta be kidding me.
ACER: What is it?
GREM: It's that tow truck from the The one from the bathroom?
ACER: The one from the bathroom?
GREM: Yeah, the one the American Agent passed the device to.
ACER: What about him?
GREM: What about him? He's in the pits!
ACER: Not for long. Acer exits, with purpose. ON FINN AND HOLLEY, still in their office hideaway. Holley's onboard computer flashes an ALERT.
HOLLEY: Hold on. I think I've got What is it?
FINN: What is it?
HOLLEY: The Pacer from the party last She's spotted Acer, moving swiftly forward.
HOLLEY: Cross-referencing with the photos from the oil derricks. Yep. His VIN numbers match.
FINN: Anyone with him? He won't be alone.
HOLLEY: Conducting analysis on the target. The computer finds more and more bad guy Pacers and Gremlins are in the crowd.
HOLLEY: He's not the only one here. Three. five. they're everywhere. And they're all closing in on. oh no. We PAN OVER to see it's MATER.
HOLLEY: Finn? Finn, where are you? She turns. He's GONE, leaving only an open window.
MATER: Wow! Some of them fellers is really HOLLEY ( OVER MATER'S RADIO ) Can you hear me? Over.
MATER: Uh, what?
MCQUEEN: Guys, a little too much chatter. Let's keep this line clear. BOOM! A racer behind McQueen suddenly expels black smoke, skids out of control. ON GREM - laughing. That was clearly his handiwork.
MATER: Is there gonna be cable where you is so I can watch the rest of the ON HOLLEY - Watching from the downtown building.
HOLLEY: ( TO FINN )
MATER: Well, all right but I usually like to have a proper detailing done before I meet a lady friend. He moves toward the back PIT DOOR, is about to open it. OUTSIDE THE PITS - ACER and another Pacer approach McQueen's pit door on the other side. Ready to pounce. The doors OPEN,
ACER: Finn McMissile? But you're dead!
FINN: Then this shouldn't hurt at all. He empties the extinguisher in their eyes, speeds past. They try and follow, but have been blinded. One of them crashes right into a COP. ON FINN - Already on the move, along a side street.
FINN: Miss Shiftwell? ON HOLLEY - Tracking everything on a grid map. Mater looks like Pac Man, weaving through the streets as bad guys close in all around him.
HOLLEY: I've got him in the back alleys east of the garages. Multiple assailants are closing in quickly.
MATER: Hey, new lady friend? You like ON THE TRACK - McQueen, hearing this, is taken aback.
MCQUEEN: ON MATER - Slowing at the flower shop.
MATER: Stay outside. Gotcha.
MCQUEEN: McQueen drifts outside allowing Francesco to slip past!
FRANCESCO: Grazie and arrivaderci!
ACER: This time I'm gonna make sure you stay dead. He hits the flame. WHOOOSSSH!!
MATER: What's that? You want me to head toward that ruckus? Mater turns INTO the alley.
MATER: Wow! A live karate demonstration! ON THE TRACK - McQueen, now playing catch-up again, scowls.
MCQUEEN: Stop it, Mater. Just sign off. IN THE BACK ALLEY - Finn polishes off the AMCs by firing a bullet into a gas main line, causing an EXPLOSION that tosses Acer through the air where he lands in a NOODLE SHOP'S SIGN. ON THE TRACK - The end of the race is nigh -
MATER: That was cool! Hey, can I get your Mater approaches when a MASS OF RACE FANS burst out a door, momentarily blocking Mater's view of Finn. Once the fans have past, Finn has disappeared.
MATER: Hey, where'd he go?
MATER: Dadgum, did I miss our date?
DARRELL CARTRIP: Francesco, over here! Hey, what was your strategy today?
FRANCESCO: Strategia? Francesco needs no strategy, it's very simple. You start the race, wait for Lightning McQueen to choke, pass him, then win. Francesco always wins. It's McQueen, waiting in the wings, rolls his eyes. He suddenly notices something O.S. McQueen's P.O.V. - It's MATER, appearing from a side street, moving toward the pits, oblivious of the press conference.
DARRELL CARTRIP: ( TO FRANCESCO )
FRANCESCO: To truly crush one's dream, you must first raise their hopes very IN MCQUEEN'S PIT GARAGE - Mater looks around for everyone as McQueen approaches.
MCQUEEN: Hey McQueen! What happened? Is the race over? You won, right?
MATER: Hey McQueen! What happened? Is the race over? You won, right?
MCQUEEN: Mater, why were you yelling things at me while I was racing?
MATER: Yelling? Oh, you thought. that's funny right there. Nah, see that's `cause I seen these two fellers doing some sort of karate street performance. It was nutso. One of them even had a flamethrower -
MCQUEEN: A flamethrower? What are you talking about? I don't understand. Where were you?
MATER: Going to meet my date.
MCQUEEN: Your date?
MATER: She started talking to me as a voice in my head, telling me where to go -
MCQUEEN: Wait a minute I didn't screw you up, did I?
MATER: Wait a minute I didn't screw you up, did I?
MCQUEEN: I lost the race because of you!
MATER: Well, I'm sorry. I didn't mean -
MCQUEEN: An imaginary girlfriend, flamethrowers. This is exactly why I don't bring you along to these
MATER: Maybe if I, I don't know, talked to somebody and explained what happened I could help.
MCQUEEN: I don't need your help. I don't want your help.
PRESS: - McQueen, you had it in the bag! - Yeah, what happened?
MCQUEEN: I made a mistake. But I can assure you, it won't happen again. On Mater. He takes this badly.
MCQUEEN: Look, guys. We know what the problem is and we've taken care of OVER FOOTAGE OF FRANCESCO and various other highlights:
BRENT MUSTANGBURGER: Lightning McQueen loses in the last lap to Francesco Bernoulli in the first race of the World Grand Prix and three, count em, three cars flamed out leading some to suggest that their fuel, Allinol, might be to blame. FOOTAGE OF MILES AXLEROD, speaking to an aggressive press. He must SHOUT over the press.
MILES AXLEROD: Allinol is safe! Alternative fuel is safe! There is no way my fuel caused these cars to flame out!
DARRELL CARTRIP: Well the jury may still be out on whether Allinol caused these accidents, but one thing's for sure: Lightning McQueen blew this Off a FROZEN IMAGE of McQueen crossing the finish line, a look of severe consternation across his face -
BRENT MUSTANGBURGER: Team McQueen can't be happy right - MATCH CUT TO - INT. AIRPORT - JAPAN - DAY - McQueen's SMILING FACE, on a Team McQueen poster. REVERSE to reveal Mater looking at it, sadly. He drives on, passing ( but not noticing ) - - GREM and ACER. AT THE SECURITY CHECK - MOMENTS LATER. Cars take off their tires, move through the metal detector. Mater waits in line. A SECURITY CAR approaches Mater.
SECURITY CAR: ( in Japanese and English ) Come with me please, sir.
MATER: But I'm gonna miss my plane. IN THE ADMIRAL'S LOUNGE - MOMENTS LATER. The Security Car leads Mater inside.
SECURITY CAR: Right this way. As they move past us the Security Car covertly drops a BALL BEARING which rolls into a corner. The ball bearing then sprouts MECHANICAL LEGS, tripods itself and IRISES out, revealing itself to be a tiny CAMERA.
MATER: Doggone it. This is about my hook, isn't it? I know I should've checked it, but I can't really, look it's attached to me. ZWAPPPPPP!! The Security Car suddenly DECLOAKS himself, reveals himself to be Finn McMissile!
MATER: Hey, I know you. You're that feller from the karate demonstration.
FINN: I never properly introduced myself. Finn McMissile. British Tow Mater. Average intelligence.
MATER: Tow Mater. Average intelligence.
FINN: Who are you with? FBI, CIA?
MATER: Let's just say I'm triple-A affiliated. You know, I know some karate. I don't wanna brag or nothing, but I've got me a black fan belt. BEEP! Finn's rearview alarms. His camera has picked up Grem and Acer. They've just entered the lounge, are right around the corner.
MATER: Hey, you wanna see some moves I made up?
FINN: You're being followed. Finn quickly turns, fires a tiny GLASS CUTTING BEETLE at the window. As Mater talks, oblivious, the beetle cuts out a round hole.
MATER: This first one I can reach into a car's hood, pull out his battery, and show it to him before he stalls. I call it, "What I accidentally did to my friend Luigi Mater does his best ( worst ) karate moves as Acer and Grem turn the corner.
GREM: There he is! The glass drops away, leaving a car-sized hole.
MATER: ( eyes the clock ) Look, I probably ought to go. I'm about to miss my flight.
FINN: Don't worry. Finn HOOKS Mater from behind. He YANKS HIM forward -
FINN: I've taken care of that. Hang on. - and LEAPS OUT THE WINDOW!
MATER: This is First Class service. You don't even have to go through the ACER and GREM appear, chasing them. Mater, who is facing backward as he is being pulled along, faces them. They're about a hundred yards back.
MATER: ( TO FINN )
FINN: Drive forward. Whatever you do, don't stop. Finn SKIDS around, whipping Mater in a 180 so that Mater is now towing Finn. Grem produces a ROCKET, lines up Finn as his target.
MATER: ( only hearing this ) Is everything okay back there?
FINN: Roger that. Mater looks up: ACER screeches into view up ahead, dragging a long row of luggage carts in Mater's path, attempting to create an accident.
MATER: ( TO FINN )
MATER: I knew I should've done carry-on!
FINN: ( TO SIDDELEY )
MATER: Hey, doggone it. It's my imaginary Come on! Get in here!
HOLLEY: Come on! Get in here!
MATER: ( TO HOLLEY )
FINN: Hold on, Sid! Siddeley peels off the runway onto the grass. A gunfight ensues between Finn and Acer. Finn SHOOTS ACER'S TIRE, blowing it and throwing him off-course. Acer CAREENS out of control, drives up and THROUGH A JET - - OUT THE OTHER SIDE where he lands in an oil tanker. ON SIDDELEY - He's headed toward the edge of the tarmac, where the grass and runway meet WATER. He HITS THE GAS, his only hope.
SIDDELEY: Finn, it's now or never! Finn BRAKES, 180s and grabs the ramp just as Siddeley gets Hold on! Mater, the only thing not in the jet, dangles and recedes from our view as Siddeley climbs toward the clouds. As he's PULLED in through the back hatch:
SIDDELEY: Hold on! Mater, the only thing not in the jet, dangles and recedes from our view as Siddeley climbs toward the clouds. As he's PULLED in through the back hatch:
MCQUEEN: "I'm so sorry for what I did. I don't want to be the cause of you losing any more races. I want you to go prove to the world what I already know - that you are the greatest race car in the whole wide world. Your best friend, Mater." McQueen takes this in.
MCQUEEN: I didn't really want him to leave.
LUIGI: Wait, there's more here.
PP.": ( to the others ) There's a few more pages of P.S.'s Well, at least I know if he's at home he'll be safe.
MCQUEEN: ( TURNING BACK )
FINN: Now that's how I like to start the day! You never feel more alive than when you're almost dead.
HOLLEY: ( SCANNING MATER )
MATER: That's the closest I ever been to missing my flight! That was -
MATER: ( JUMPS )
HOLLEY: Still in one piece, great. Holley drops the device into a mainframe computer. It starts
"ANALYZING.": I gotta go to a doctor. I keep getting these sharp pains in my Downloading the photo now.
MATER: I gotta go to a doctor. I keep getting these sharp pains in my Downloading the photo now.
HOLLEY: Downloading the photo now.
MATER: Hey, lemme introduce you two.
HOLLEY: Oh yes, sorry. It's Shiftwell. Holley Shiftwell.
MATER: ( TO FINN )
FINN: Finally. Time to see who's behind all this. AN IMAGE is blasted between the three of them. It's of a photograph, a complicated melange of metallic parts stuck ( to Mater, expectantly ) What is this?
HOLLEY: ( to Mater, expectantly ) What is this?
MATER: Well, that's one of the worst engines ever made. It's an old aluminum V8 with a Lucas electrical system and Whitworth bolts. Shoot, them Whitworth bolts is a pain, tell you what. Them ain't metric, they ain't inches.
HOLLEY: Yes, OK, right. But who's engine is this, Mater?
MATER: Well, it's kinda hard to tell from this picture, ain't it?
HOLLEY: But you're the one who took it.
FINN: Oh, right. Yes, of course. "A good agent gets what he can, then gets out before he's killed." Sorry.
HOLLEY: Oh, right. Yes, of course. "A good agent gets what he can, then gets out before he's killed." Sorry.
MATER: Agent? You mean like insurance agent, like,
FINN: Holley, in how many makes and models did this type of engine Holley has these stats in seconds. Kid's play.
HOLLEY: It was standard in seven models over a 12-year period. At least 35,000 cars were made with this Mater MOVES HIS SEAT FORWARD, through one part of the hologram so he's face-to-face with Holley.
MATER: You're pretty.
HOLLEY: ( ANNOYED )
MATER: And so nice.
HOLLEY: Just pay attention. She moves the engine photo so it's now blocking Mater again.
FINN: This seems like a dead end. If there were something in the photo that could narrow this down a bit I'd be a lot happier.
MATER: You might not be happy, but I bet this feller is. See how he's had most of his parts replaced? And see all them boxes over there? Them's all original parts. They ain't easy to come by.
HOLLEY: Rare parts.
FINN: That's something we can track.
HOLLEY: Holley drops her screen down.
FINN: Well done, Mater! I would never have seen that.
MATER: Wait, what?
FINN: You obviously have plenty of experience in the field.
MATER: Well yeah I live right next to one. ( thinks about it ) I don't know, Finn. I ain't exactly been much help to anybody recently.
FINN: You're helping me. Please, Mater.
MATER: Well, okay. But you know I'm just a tow truck, right?
FINN: Right. And I'm just in the import/export business. Siddeley?
SIDDELEY: Yes, Finn?
FINN: Paris. Tout de suite.
MATER: Yeah, two of them sweets for me too, Sid!
HOLLEY: ( SMILING SWEETLY )
SIDDELEY: Afterburners, sir?
FINN: Is there any other way?
FINN: ( TO HOLLEY )
HOLLEY: No VIN scans. Got it.
FINN: Don't talk to anyone. Don't look at anyone. And absolutely, positively no idling. Are we clear?
HOLLEY: Yes, right. No idling. Yes, sir.
FINN: Yeah, Finn?
MATER: Yeah, Finn?
FINN: We're not here to go shopping. As Finn and Holley and Mater turn the corner.
MATER: Shopping? What do you mean? Why would I - Mater turns the corner and enters a massive Les Halles- inspired Parisian market filled with car parts. A tow truck's - Parts for sale, Monsieur! - Monsieur! Parts for sale!
MATER: - Parts for sale, Monsieur! - Monsieur! Parts for sale!
MERCHANTS: - Parts for sale, Monsieur! - Monsieur! Parts for sale!
MATER: You gotta be kidding me - they've got everything here. Look at them hoods! I could use a hood. Mater continues on though, heeding Finn's advice.
MATER: Sorry fellers, I gotta go.
MATER: Excuse me. What are you selling? It suddenly OPENS its headlights revealing. EYES!! In French, the mutant car pitches his wares to Mater. Mater FREAKS OUT, speeds off, TERRIFIED.
FINN: There you are. Mater suddenly turns the corner, sees Finn and Holley.
MATER: Man, there are some great -
FINN: Mater, get back! Too late. Tomber sees Mater, then notices FINN, reflected in a hubcap. He BOLTS. Finn and Holley give chase.
MATER: Hey, wait for me! Tomber, skidding away, kicks a tent in Finn's way. Holley quickly pivots RIGHT and disappears. Where did she go?
FINN: ( TO HOLLEY )
HOLLEY: But I thought -
FINN: Mater! This chap needs a tow. Hook him up.
MATER: Sure thing.
TOMBER: You rusty piece of junk, get your dirty hook off me!
FINN: ( to the cars ) Allez! Maintenant - vite! Mater unhooks an angry Tomber who spits in French. Finn pulls the door down. As it LATCHES TIGHT -
TOMBER: ( TO FINN )
FINN: Easy, Tomber. This is her first field assignment - she didn't know you were my informant.
HOLLEY: A rookie, eh? I never liked new car- Holley FUMES with anger.
TOMBER: A rookie, eh? I never liked new car- Holley FUMES with anger.
FINN: Tomber was doing 20 to life in a Moroccan impound the first time I saved him, if I recall correctly.
TOMBER: Speaking of recalls, you're getting up there in mileage aren't you, Alright, we get it. You both know each other, you're both old. So. Holley shoots a HOLOGRAPHIC PHOTO of the engine in front of There you go, informant. Inform us. Tomber eyes the photo. He recoils, unimpressed.
HOLLEY: Alright, we get it. You both know each other, you're both old. So. Holley shoots a HOLOGRAPHIC PHOTO of the engine in front of There you go, informant. Inform us. Tomber eyes the photo. He recoils, unimpressed.
HOLLEY: There you go, informant. Inform us. Tomber eyes the photo. He recoils, unimpressed.
TOMBER: That is the worst motor ever made. Suddenly, Tomber narrows his gaze.
TOMBER: Wait. That oil filter. those wheel bearings.
FINN: Do those parts look familiar, They should. I sold them.
TOMBER: They should. I sold them.
HOLLEY: To whom?
TOMBER: No idea. He's my best customer, but he always does his business over the phone. I was always wondering why he needs so many parts. Now I Well, a lemon needs parts. Ain't nothing truer than that.
MATER: Well, a lemon needs parts. Ain't nothing truer than that.
FINN: Yeah, you know. Cars that don't ever work right. Lemons is a tow truck's bread and butter. Like them Gremlins and Pacers we run into at the party and the race and the Holley, pull up the pictures from the oil platform. I want to know what other type of cars were out Holley complies and suddenly PHOTOS OF CARS FROM THE OIL PLATFORM hang suspended in the air in front of them.
MATER: Yeah, you know. Cars that don't ever work right. Lemons is a tow truck's bread and butter. Like them Gremlins and Pacers we run into at the party and the race and the Holley, pull up the pictures from the oil platform. I want to know what other type of cars were out Holley complies and suddenly PHOTOS OF CARS FROM THE OIL PLATFORM hang suspended in the air in front of them.
FINN: Holley, pull up the pictures from the oil platform. I want to know what other type of cars were out Holley complies and suddenly PHOTOS OF CARS FROM THE OIL PLATFORM hang suspended in the air in front of them.
HOLLEY: Right. Let's see. There were Hugos. And Trunkovs.
FINN: Mater, are these cars considered Is the Popemobile Catholic?
MATER: Is the Popemobile Catholic?
HOLLEY: Finn. Everyone involved in this plot is one of history's biggest loser cars. Holley refers to the ENGINE PHOTO, which now rises forward as the prominent picture, perhaps the only one in view.
FINN: And they're all taking their orders from the car behind this engine.
TOMBER: This explains it!
FINN: What, Tomber?
TOMBER: Gremlin, Pacer, Hugo and Trunkovs never get together. But they're having a secret meeting in two Where's this meeting taking place?
FINN: Where's this meeting taking place?
TOMBER: Porto Corsa, Italy.
MATER: That's where the next race is!
FINN: Then there's a good chance our mystery engine will be there too.
TOMBER: Your chances are more than good. I just sent him a new clutch assembly yesterday. to Porto Corsa.
FINN: Holley, contact Stephenson and have him meet us at Gare de Lyon. Good EXT. FRENCH ALPS - NIGHT STEPHENSON, a THREE-CAR LUXURY BULLET TRAIN speeds along a snow-covered mountain in the dead of night, its halogen headlight cutting through the darkness. It DIPS into a
MATER: You never see this many lemons in one town. Unless there's a swap meet, or something.
HOLLEY: Well, I remotely reprogrammed Porto Corsa's red light cameras to do recognition scans.
MATER: Wow, not only is you the prettiest car I ever met, but you the smartest too.
HOLLEY: Thank you. I think.
MATER: That's a familiar sight. Mater refers to a photo of VICTOR HUGO, the HUGO Lemonhead, being towed by an EASTERN EUROPEAN TOW TRUCK.
MATER: A Hugo being towed. But he looks absolutely perfect.
FINN: Of course. They must be the heads of the lemon families.
MATER: Makes sense. If I was rich and broke down every day, I'd hire me to tow me around all the time too.
FINN: We've got to infiltrate that meeting. It's the only way to find out who's behind all this.
HOLLEY: ( EYEING MATER )
MATER: Hold still. Holley SNAPS Mater's picture, temporarily blinding him.
HOLLEY: Hold still. Holley SNAPS Mater's picture, temporarily blinding him.
MATER: Holley turns back to her monitor. Mater's face appears on screen. She quickly GRAFTS it over the Hugo's tow truck's.
FINN: Good job, Miss Shiftwell. Holley isn't sure what surprises her more: the compliment or how pleased it makes her.
HOLLEY: Thank you, Finn.
MATER: Boy, I sure wish my friends could see me now.
LUIGI: Guido, your eyes do not deceive you. We are in Italy. We are home! Sarge, Fillmore and McQueen exit a WGP transport truck.
FILLMORE: Hey, Luigi. Which way to the hotel, What? No friends of mine will stay in a hotel in my village. You will stay with my - Uncle Topolino! UNCLE TOPOLINO, a distinguished 1937 Fiat Topolino, rolls forward. He greets them warmly with affectionate Italian salutations as word of Guido and Luigi's arrival spreads. The square FILLS with family and friends.
LUIGI: What? No friends of mine will stay in a hotel in my village. You will stay with my - Uncle Topolino! UNCLE TOPOLINO, a distinguished 1937 Fiat Topolino, rolls forward. He greets them warmly with affectionate Italian salutations as word of Guido and Luigi's arrival spreads. The square FILLS with family and friends.
SARGE: How do they do it? These are the same ingredients as back home, but it tastes so good.
FILLMORE: It's organic, man.
SARGE: Tree hugger. LIGHTNING MCQUEEN rolls along the periphery of the square, seems lost in thought.
UNCLE TOPOLINO: You look so down, so low. Is like you have flat tires. MAMA TOPOLINO, a hefty Italian grandmother pipes up, a mile a minute then drives off, now a car on a mission.
UNCLE TOPOLINO: She said you look like you're starving. That she's going to make you a big meal, and fatten you up.
MCQUEEN: No, Mama Topolino, please. You don't need to make a fuss! Too late. She's disappeared inside her kitchen.
UNCLE TOPOLINO: Capisco. I understand. Is a problem, yes? Between you and a How'd you know that?
MCQUEEN: How'd you know that?
UNCLE TOPOLINO: A wise car hears one word and understands two. McQueen takes this in, impressed.
UNCLE TOPOLINO: That, and Luigi told me. While Mama cooks, come and take a stroll with They amble forward, Uncle Topolino setting the pace.
MCQUEEN: I brought my friend Mater along on the trip. And I told him he needed to act different, that we weren't in Radiator Springs.
UNCLE TOPOLINO: This Mater. He's a close friend?
MCQUEEN: He's my best friend.
UNCLE TOPOLINO: Then why would you ask him to be someone else? McQueen considers this - a realization.
MCQUEEN: What did I do? I said some things during our fight.
UNCLE TOPOLINO: You know, back when Guido and Luigi used to work for me, they would fight over everything. IN THE SQUARE - Guido dances with a girl. Luigi suddenly CUTS IN. They begin to ARGUE.
UNCLE TOPOLINO: They fight over what Ferrari was the best Ferrari; which one of them look more like a Ferrari. There were even some non-Ferrari Guido now LIFTS Luigi, cuts BACK in.
UNCLE TOPOLINO: So I tell them, va bene. It's okay to fight. Everybody fights now and then, especially best friends. McQueen takes this in. Seems to take some small comfort.
UNCLE TOPOLINO: But you gotta make up fast. McQueen's comfort quickly evaporates.
UNCLE TOPOLINO: No fight more important than Guido and Luigi now dance together with the girl and her friend who has just arrived. All having a great time. They dance past us, crossing in front of MCQUEEN AND UNCLE TOPOLINO. We STAY WITH them.
UNCLE TOPOLINO: Chi trova un'amico, trova un What does that mean?
MCQUEEN: What does that mean?
MAMA TOPOLINO: ( ARRIVING )
MAMA TOPOLINO: Now, mangia! Eat! ON MCQUEEN, distant, taking all of this in, lost in thought as, in the background, Uncle Topolino and Mama Topolino talk, then argue, then make up ( all in Italian ) all while we stay on McQueen's pensive face -
STEPHENSON: Finn, one hour to Porto Corsa.
FINN: Thank you, Stephenson. Finn watches as HOLLEY attaches a new EMERGENCY LIGHT on Mater's roof. It looks exactly like his old one.
HOLLEY: That should just about do it.
FINN: So Mater, it's voice-activated. But you know, everything's voice- activated these days.
HOLLEY: So Mater, it's voice-activated. But you know, everything's voice- activated these days.
MATER: What? I thought you was supposed to be making me a disguise.
MATER'S COMPUTER: Voice recognized. Disguise Program ZWWWWAT! A HOLOGRAPHIC disguise suddenly umbrellas out, emitted from Mater's roof. It drops a clean cloaking image of the EASTERN EUROPEAN TOW TRUCK over Mater.
MATER: Cool! Hey, computer. Make me a German truck!
MATER'S COMPUTER: Request acknowledged. ZWATTTT! Mater suddenly wears lederhosen and a German hat.
MATER: Check it out. I'm wearing Materhosen. Make me a monster Request acknowledged. He's transformed into Dracula, complete with fangs.
MATER'S COMPUTER: Request acknowledged. He's transformed into Dracula, complete with fangs.
MATER: ( ALA DRACULA )
MATER'S COMPUTER: Request acknowledged.
MATER: A funny car!
MATER'S COMPUTER: Request acknowledged. Finn suddenly pushes a button, stops the madness.
FINN: The idea is to keep a low profile, Mater, chastened, moves on.
MATER: So I just go in, pretend to be this And leave the rest to us.
FINN: And leave the rest to us.
HOLLEY: Now hold still. Holley turns back to her work. The disguise's cloaking is larger than Mater. As a result, Holley must dial it back to fit his body. As she carefully calibrates the hologram:
HOLLEY: I have to do the final fitting on your disguise. Holley STOPS. The 3D disguise is now flush with his frame, but dents SHOW THROUGH.
HOLLEY: Oh dear. That's no good. She deploys A BONDO SPRAYER on a robotic arm, moves it toward one of Mater's DENTS. Mater pulls away.
MATER: Hey, what are you doing?
HOLLEY: The disguise won't calibrate effectively without a smooth surface to graft onto.
MATER: Oh. For a second there I thought you was trying to fix my dents.
HOLLEY: I was.
MATER: Well then no thank you. I don't get them dents buffed, pulled, filled or painted by nobody. They're way too valuable.
HOLLEY: Your dents are valuable?
MATER: I come by each one of them with my best friend Lightning McQueen.
HOLLEY: So you were being serious in Paris? McQueen isn't just part of your Friendships can be dangerous in our line of work, Mater.
FINN: Friendships can be dangerous in our line of work, Mater.
MATER: But my line of work is towing and Right. And Miss Shiftwell's is designing iPhone apps.
FINN: Right. And Miss Shiftwell's is designing iPhone apps.
MATER: No, I meant for real. I -
HOLLEY: It's okay. Say no more. I'll work around the dent.
FINN: In the meantime. Finn hits a button. The walls transform into a MASSIVE
FINN: You look a little light on weapons. Off Mater's RXN -
BRENT MUSTANGBURGER: The big news continues to be Allinol. Sir Miles Axlerod spoke to the press earlier today to answer questions about its safety. FOOTAGE OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE - Miles Axlerod, at a podium, addresses the press throng. He looks a bit exasperated.
MILES AXLEROD: An independent panel of scientists has determined that Allinol is completely safe. Okay? Safe! There it is.
BRENT MUSTANGBURGER: So the race will go on, folks. RACE GRAPHICS show Francesco with 10 points at the top of the race standings.
DARRELL CARTRIP: But the question everyone is asking: Will the real Lightning McQueen show up today? ON THE TRACK - As the racers begin to get into position on the grid.
FRANCESCO: ( to the crowd ) Bellissima! Thank you for your And your big mistake, McQueen! McQueen missed this comment. He approaches his grid position, lost in thought.
LUIGI: McQueen? Is everything okay?
FILLMORE: If you're worried about your fuel, man, don't. It's perfectly safe.
MCQUEEN: No, guys, I just really wish Mater were here.
MCQUEEN: Oh, great. Here it comes. What've you got, Francesco?
FRANCESCO: For famous race cars like Francesco and well. you, to be far away from home is not easy.
MCQUEEN: I think you forgot the insulting part of that insult.
FRANCESCO: Is no insult. When Francesco is away from home, he misses his mama just like you miss your tow truck Gee, I maybe misjudged you, because that's exactly how I -
MCQUEEN: Gee, I maybe misjudged you, because that's exactly how I -
FRANCESCO: Of course, I am at home. And my mama is right here. Francesco refers to his MAMA who sits in a special box in the crowd, cheering him on, blowing him kisses.
FRANCESCO: ( YELLS )
MCQUEEN: And there's the insult we were missing. Grazie!
ALEXANDER HUGO: Gremlins. Man, those are some ugly cars. Look like someone stole their The THUGS all SNICKER.
HOLLEY: Scusatemi, tutti! Signori! Holley arrives, sporting a decent Italian accent.
HOLLEY: Mio nonno, my grandfather, has broken down. If one of you would help I would be so thankful. IVAN, AN EASTERN EUROPEAN TOW TRUCK ( the one Holley and Finn prepped Mater to impersonate ), drives forward.
ANOTHER HUGO: She was talking to me, Ivan.
HOLLEY: No, no, don't fight over me. Holley directs her interest toward Ivan.
HOLLEY: Signore Tow Truck, per favore?
FINN: You're on any moment now.
MATER: I don't know about this, Finn. What if I screw things up?
MATER: It's just that them guys look pretty tough and - Wait, did you say "idiot"? Is that how you see FINN ( OVER RADIO ) That's how everyone sees you. Isn't that the idea? I tell you, that's the genius of it. No one realizes they're being fooled because they're too busy laughing at the fool. Brilliant. While Finn talks, Mater takes this in. He catches his own reflection in a nearby window. Seems to be seeing himself with new eyes.
HOLLEY: Why aren't you in disguise?
MATER: I, uh-
HOLLEY: Come on, there's no time. Go!
MATER: Okay, okay. Computer: disguise.
MATER'S COMPUTER: Request acknowledged.
ALEXANDER HUGO: It's the boss! He is coming! The carrier parks and the back opens. VICTOR HUGO waits.
VICTOR HUGO: Mater realizes Victor is talking to him. He hops to it.
VICTOR HUGO: Ivan, why do you insult me so by making me wait? Mater, now with Victor hooked, tows him in the front doors of the casino. ON FINN - now joined in the cafe by Holley who monitors everything and SEES EVERYTHING MATER SEES on her display.
HOLLEY: He's in.
MATER: ( WIDE-EYED )
MATER: Why is that? What do you mean don't talk to you? ( more talking from Holley which we cannot hear ) So you want me to stop talking to you. Right now?
ALEXANDER HUGO: You are acting strange today, Ivan.
MATER: I have no idea what you're talking MATER'S P.O.V. - A digital readout isolates the Hugo and starts to scroll reams of information alongside.
MATER: .Alexander Hugo, aka "Chop Shop IN A WIDER SHOT we realize this display is invisible to all but Mater. Some of Alex's other alias' include "Alexander Hu- Don't Go" and "Alexander the Not-So Great."
MATER: Hey, you got a lot of aka's, Alex. But I guess that makes sense seeings how you's wanted in France, Germany, the Czech Republic.
HOLLEY: ( cutting in to his
DISPLAY ): Mater! Stop it! Alexander Hugo, unaware of Holley's interruption, whispers to Mater as they turn a corner.
ALEXANDER HUGO: Okay, okay. Keep your voice down. You're gonna make me arrested. ( to the other Hugos ) Don't mess with Ivan today. He's in a bad mood.
FINN: He's so good.
VLADIMIR TRUNKOV: TUBBS PACER
TUBBS PACER: Hey, Victor!
VLADIMIR TRUNKOV: Come in, come in.
VICTOR HUGO: Is the big boss here yet?
VLADIMIR TRUNKOV: No, not yet.
TUBBS PACER: He's supposed to be here any WHAM! A DOOR is thrown open O.S. Everyone turns, now silent. ON THE DOOR - It sits open. No one enters. The room of Lemons watch, nervous. ON MATER - Nervously watching too.
FINN: Here we go.
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: Guten Tag! Everyone looks disappointed.
TUBBS PACER: It's just the Professor.
VICTOR HUGO: Zundapp, when is he coming?
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: He's already here. MONITORS descend from the ceiling. On them, an image of AN ENGINE - the same bloody engine from the photo. But this is a LIVE image. The car is being worked on.
VOICE: Welcome, everyone. The VOICE is garbled, scrambled. No way to determine who.
ENGINE VOICE: I wish I could be with you on this very special day but. my clutch assembly broke. You know how it is. The Lemons all nod in understanding.
TUBBS PACER: Been there.
VLADIMIR TRUNKOV: We know how you feel.
FINN: Descramble that voice!
HOLLEY: ( already on it ) I'm trying. It's too INT. PRIVATE ROOM - CASINO - CONTINUOUS We are here to celebrate. Today all your hard work pays off. The world turned their backs on cars like us.

ENGINE VOICE: Jalopy. Rustbucket. On TUBBS PACER.
ENGINE VOICE: Heap. Clunker. On J. CURBY GREMLIN:
ENGINE VOICE: Junker, beater, wreck. On ZUNDAPP.
ENGINE VOICE: And finally back on the monitor. The ENGINE.
ENGINE VOICE: Lemon. But their insults just give us strength. Because today, my The monitors switch to LIVE RACE FOOTAGE.
ENGINE VOICE: .that all ends. On the VIDEO SCREENS - CARLA VELOSO'S ENGINE BLOWS -
FINN: What just happened?
HOLLEY: ( analyzing the data ) I'm working on it.
ENGINE VOICE: They laughed at us. But now it's our turn to laugh back. BOOM! Another racer blows an engine. Mater JUMPS again.
FINN: I'm detecting an extremely strong electromagnetic pulse. Holley replays that last crash. The OUTLINE OF THE BEAM is seen hitting the racer. Holley TRACES THIS to its source - - a WGP CAMERA, which Grem and Acer have pointed at the racers from a tower position.
HOLLEY: I'm detecting an extremely strong electromagnetic pulse. Holley replays that last crash. The OUTLINE OF THE BEAM is seen hitting the racer. Holley TRACES THIS to its source - - a WGP CAMERA, which Grem and Acer have pointed at the racers from a tower position.
HOLLEY: Finn, it's the camera!
FINN: On the tower. Finn TAKES OFF, speeding toward Grem and Acer -
HOLLEY: On the tower. Finn TAKES OFF, speeding toward Grem and Acer -
ENGINE VOICE: And we, the owners of the world's largest untapped oil reserve, will become the most powerful cars in the world!
FINN: Get out of the way! Andate! He speeds furiously through town.
ENGINE VOICE: They will come to us and they will have no choice, `cause they will need us. ON FINN - He SPEEDS up a road, Grem and Acer visible ahead of him. He LEAPS over the crevasse toward the AMC cousins - Suddenly, FINN FREEZES. He's immobilized in mid-air! He looks up. A CHOPPER with a LARGE MAGNET hovers over him.
ACER: ( TO FINN )
FINN: INT. PRIVATE ROOM - CASINO - CONTINUOUS
ENGINE VOICE: Long live Lemons!
HOLLEY: EXT. FINISH LINE - PORTO CORSA - CONTINUOUS McQueen NOSES out Francesco for a win, both oblivious to what's just happened.
MCQUEEN: Dah! This is impossible!
FRANCESCO: Dah! This is impossible!
MCQUEEN: That's what I'm talking about. Kachow! Hey, where are all the other cars?
FRANCESCO: What is going on? They see the pile-up from an overhead monitor. Sirens blare as a MEDIC CHOPPER flies to the scene of the pile-up.
MCQUEEN: ( REALIZES )
BRENT MUSTANGBURGER: Sir Axlerod! Is the final race in London still going to take place? PULL BACK to reveal we are watching this on monitors in the PRIVATE CASINO ROOM with the Lemonheads, Zundapp and Mater.
VLADIMIR TRUNKOV: Shh, quiet!
VLADIMIR TRUNKOV: Here it comes. On Miles Axlerod: He's devastated.
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: A toast! To the death of Allinol and alternative fuel forever!
HOLLEY: Mater. Abort the mission. They've got Finn. Get out of there. Get out of there right now! She turns a corner and STOPS. Her escape is now blocked by the same HUGO THUGS she tricked before. Another vehicle appears BEHIND HER, LOOMS.
ALEXANDER HUGO: Isn't this a great party, Ivan?
MATER: Oh yeah, it's unbelievable.
ALEXANDER HUGO: You are not leaving, are you?
MATER: Uh, of course I ain't leavin'.
MATER: He turns, sees that McQueen is being interviewed on the
LEMONHEADS: - What?! - Did he just say Allinol? After today?
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: Yes, sir. Of course. Zundapp hangs up, turns to the room.
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: Allinol must be finished for good. McQueen cannot win the last race. Lightning McQueen must be killed. Mater's eyes open wide.
MATER: Mater backs up, KNOCKING his emergency light against one of the monitors. ZZZZZAT! His holographic disguise flickers away then quickly SCROLLS THROUGH all of his previous disguises, finally revealing rusty old Mater.
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: It's the American spy!
MATER: MATER'S COMPUTER
MATER'S COMPUTER: "Gatling gun" request acknowledged. WHIRRRRR! GUNS roll out of Mater on each side.
MATER: Shoot. I didn't mean -
MATER'S COMPUTER: Request acknowledged. Mater SPRAYS BULLETS into the crowd.
VLADIMIR TRUNKOV: Get down!
MATER: The Lemons and Lemonheads hit the deck and RETURN FIRE - Mater is THROWN BACKWARD by the force of the guns, back through some double doors and onto a BALCONY.
MATER: Wait wait! I didn't mean that kind of shoot!
MATER'S COMPUTER: Correction acknowledged. Deploying WHOOM! A PARACHUTE BURSTS out of the back of Mater, he catches air and is YANKED INTO THE SKY! The Lemonheads watch him float away, amazed. ON MATER, out of the frying pan but still toasty. He looks around, notices: LIGHTNING MCQUEEN, far away, leaving the press podium.
MATER: Mater looks down at the harbor, over which he flies. He spots a MOTORBOAT. Mater WHIPS his hook down, steals a ride behind the boat TOWARD MCQUEEN.
ITALIAN MOTORBOAT: The motorboat isn't happy about this, tries to shake him. Mater is THROWN INTO A "HOTEL" sign, then SMASHES down through a Francesco souvenir stand. As he CRASHES onto the ground hard, we SMASH CUT TO -
MATER: Lemme through! Lemme through! MATER barrels around a corner. He's now covered in Francesco memorabilia and palm leaves. The word `HOT' now dangles off him like the world's biggest bling. He looks INSANE.
MATER: ( TO SECURITY )
MATER: No, listen! I was disguised as a tow truck to infiltrate this Lemonhead meeting and my weapons system misinterperated what I was
MATER: McQueen! McQueen! JUST OFF THE PRESS STAGE - McQueen is led toward the exit.
PRESS LIAISON: Right this way, signore.
MCQUEEN: McQueen looks up but can only see A SEA OF VEHICLES, flashbulbs, cameras, TV trucks with those tall satellite antennae things that spindle toward the sky. BACK AT THE SECURITY BARRICADE - Mater, like a nimble running back, dances around to avoid capture by security.
MATER: ITALIAN SECURITY #1
MATER: ON MCQUEEN
ON MCQUEEN: That really sounded like Mater. ON MATER, getting CLOSER.
MCQUEEN: That really sounded like Mater. ON MATER, getting CLOSER.
PRESS LIAISON: ( TO MCQUEEN )
MATER: McQueen, they're gonna kill you!! ON MCQUEEN - Okay, he's positive that was his friend, but where is he?
MCQUEEN: McQueen spots a TOW HOOK, moving through the crowd toward him, "Jaws"-like.
MCQUEEN: Excuse me. McQueen disappears into the press crowd.
PRESS LIAISON: No, no, where are you going? Please, Mr. McQueen! McQueen pushes through the press.
MCQUEEN: Scusi. Mater! Scusi. McQueen tracks the tow hook, gets closer. He pushes through the last few vehicles -
MCQUEEN: Mater, I'm so glad to see you. I'm so sorr - It's NOT MATER. It's IVAN, the Hugo Thug's tow truck.
MCQUEEN: ( CONFUSED )
MCQUEEN: What? Oh. I mean, thanks.
PRESS LIAISON: Right this way, signore - Now the Press Liaison and his assistants are pushing McQueen back in the other direction -
MCQUEEN: ( as he's pulled away ) I really thought I heard my friend. As he's pulled away, press and onlookers start to come between him and Ivan, who hasn't moved.
MCQUEEN: Wait, what? The ITALIAN PRESS being to swarm.
PRESS LIAISON: Please, the world press is waiting. You come with me, please. McQueen is pulled back -
MATER: Let me go!
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: You actually care about that race car. A pity you didn't warn him in As the doors close on Mater - PHHHHHSSSSSSTTTTTTT! A thick, noxious gas starts to fill the truck. On MATER as the knockout gas works its magic. HIS EYES CLOSE.
MATER: Domo arigato! McQueen, Fillmore, Guido, Luigi, Sarge and patrons eye Mater, embarrassed and angry. - IN THE JAPANESE MUSEUM - The moment of Mater banging on the Zen rock garden's glass. Except that now we see all sorts of disappointed and eyebrow raising reactions.
MATER: You done good! You got all the Check out that tow truck.
JEFF GORVETTE: Check out that tow truck.
LEWIS HAMILTON: I wonder who that guy's with?
MCQUEEN: ( HUMILIATED )
MATER: Now that's a scoop of ice cream! Mater swallows the wasabi with one big bite. He SCREAMS! The sushi bar patrons blanch with revulsion at his wail. - ON THE FOUNTAIN, as Mater peels into full view of everyone else at the party. As Mater laps up water from a fountain:
MCQUEEN: ( EMBARRASSED )
MATER: I never leak oil. Never.
MCQUEEN: Mater, you have to get a hold of yourself. You're making a scene! - IN MCQUEEN'S PIT GARAGE, after the Japanese race.
MATER: Wait a minute. I didn't screw you up, did I?
MCQUEEN: I lost the race because of you!
MATER: Maybe if I talked to somebody, or-
MCQUEEN: I don't need your help. I don't want your help! - Now BACK AT THE PARTY, a moment we didn't see before but which presumably happened. Mater is BANGING a ceremonial GONG, to the horror of Japanese guests.
MATER: Bang a gong, get it on!
DISSATISFIED CACOPHONY: Listen, this isn't Radiator Springs. This is exactly why I don't bring you along to these Off the GONG at the party -
MCQUEEN: Listen, this isn't Radiator Springs. This is exactly why I don't bring you along to these Off the GONG at the party -
MATER: Holley! Finn! Where are we?
FINN: We're in London, Mater. Inside Big EXT. BIG BENTLEY - CONTINUOUS The BIG HAND finishes ADVANCING one minute. It's 3 PM.
MATER: Woaaaah! - WHAP! The chain yanks to a STOP. Mater, instead of being 30 feet from death, is now 20. Finn and Holley are only a few clicks closer to being crushed themselves. The clock ticks to 3:01.
MATER: This. this is all my fault.
FINN: Don't be a fool, Mater.
MATER: But I am, remember? You said so.
FINN: When did I. Oh. Mater, I was complimenting you on what a good spy you are.
MATER: I'm not a spy! This echoes throughout the clock.
MATER: I've been trying to tell you that the whole time. I really am just a tow truck. Finn and Holley take this in.
HOLLEY: Finn, he's not joking.
FINN: I know.
MATER: You were right, Finn. I'm a fool. And what's happened to McQueen is `cause I'm such a big one. This is all my fault. GREM and ACER arrive on a lift, roll into view on a catwalk.
GREM: Good, you're up!
ACER: And just in time!
GREM: Professor Z wanted you to have a front row seat for the death of Lightning McQueen.
MATER: ( HOPEFUL )
ACER: Not for much longer. He pushes the camera through an open small window, turns it toward the course. Mater DROPS down again - FINN and HOLLEY CLICK FORWARD.
MCQUEEN: I called to talk to Mater. It never occurred to me that he wouldn't be Sheriff is talking to Scotland Yard right now.
RAMONE: Sheriff is talking to Scotland Yard right now.
FLO: And Sarge is in touch with his friends in the British military.
SALLY: You just need to focus on the race.
MCQUEEN: I know, but Sal, with everything going on I'm not sure I should- A HORN O.S. Someone's entering the pit. Everyone parts, revealing MILES AXLEROD.
MCQUEEN: Sir Axlerod.
MILES AXLEROD: I'm sorry to interrupt.
MCQUEEN: No, no, it's all right.
MILES AXLEROD: I just wanted to come down here and personally thank you. Because after Italy, I was finished. And then you gave me one last shot.
MCQUEEN: Listen, I -
MILES AXLEROD: And I probably shouldn't be saying this at all but. I hope you win today. Show the world that they've been wrong about Allinol. McQueen takes this in. He looks at Sally.
SALLY: Mater would want you to race.
MCQUEEN: All right. For Mater.
GREM: Here he comes! Grem turns up the juice to the HIGHEST, DEATH-INDUCING LEVEL. Holley and Finn watch, helpless. Mater closes his eyes. Grem ZAPS MCQUEEN.
GREM: I don't know, Professor.
ACER: What did you do?
GREM: ( TO ACER )
ACER: You broke it.
GREM: ( INTO RADIO )
ACER: What'd he say?
GREM: We go to the backup plan.
MATER: Backup plan??
GREM: We snuck a bomb in McQueen's pit!
ACER: The next time he makes a stop, instead of saying "ka-chow," he's gonna go "ka-boom"! They LAUGH. Mater shudders, upset.
GREM: Don't feel bad, tow truck. You couldn't have saved him.
ACER: Oh, wait. You could have! Grem and Acer laugh. As they board the elevator:
MATER: Dadgum lemons.
MATER'S COMPUTER: Request acknowledged. Suddenly, Mater's GATLING GUNS rotate out again - a surprise to Mater. But they SPIN IN PLACE, empty. Grem and Acer just laugh more.
GREM: What, you didn't think we'd take your bullets? Mater NOTICES SOMETHING.
ACER: That's right! You got nothin'.
GREM: ( as the elevator descends ) Who's the lemon now, huh? They're GONE.
FINN: Nice try, Mater.
MATER: MATER'S COMPUTER REQUEST ACK-
MATER'S COMPUTER: REQUEST ACK-
MATER: Dadgum! Dadgum! Dadgum! The COMPUTER responds with each "dadgum." The barrels continue to SPIN, CUTTING THROUGH the ropes.
MATER: DADGUMDADGUMDADGUMDADGUM -
HOLLEY: Mater QUICKLY WHIPS his tow cable around, hooks a pipe and tosses himself to the ramp with a heavy THUD. He doesn't
MATER: I gotta get you all out of there!
FINN: There's no time. McQueen needs your help, Mater.
MATER: But I can't, I'm just a tow truck.
FINN: It's up to you. Go to the pits and get everyone out. You can do that.
MATER: What about you guys?
FINN: We'll be okay.
HOLLEY: Go and get some more dents, Mater.
HOLLEY: So we'll be "okay"? Really?
FINN: He wouldn't have left if I'd told him the truth. ( re: his death trap ) Being killed by a clock. Gives a whole new meaning to "your time has At this mention Holley seems to perk up, gets an idea.
HOLLEY: Time. That's it! She spies a GEARBOX below them, at least 20 feet down. Holley
FINN: What are you doing?
HOLLEY: Trying to turn back time. If I can just reverse the polarity. She FIRES them again. Direct hit!
FINN: Good job! Quick thinking, Holley!
MATER: What's everybody on the wrong side of the road for?!
HOLLEY: Oh no!
FINN: They both DRIVE, fast as they can with FULL FORCE -
FINN: Burn rubber!! They drive HARDER, separating bumpers with just enough room for the descending gear to SNAP THEIR ROPES! Their tires spinning, they both LAUNCH off in opposite directions, LAND HARD on opposing platforms. As Finn squeals around to Holley's side of the clock:
FINN: We've got to get to the course. Calculate the fastest way to - Holley pops WINGS out of her side.
HOLLEY: ( IMPRESSED )
FINN: ( IMPRESSED )
HOLLEY: They're standard issue now.
FINN: You kids get all the good hardware. They turn to leave when they STOP, see SOMETHING. It's an AIR FILTER on the ground.
HOLLEY: Oh no. That's Mater's.
FINN: I knew his escape was too easy.
LUIGI: Everybody get out! Get out now! Y'all gotta get out the pits! The ENTIRE RADIATOR SPRINGS GANG is here.
MATER: Everybody get out! Get out now! Y'all gotta get out the pits! The ENTIRE RADIATOR SPRINGS GANG is here.
MATER: Hey, what are you guys doing here?
SALLY: We're here because of you, Mater.
FLO: Is everything okay?
MATER: No! Everything's not okay! There's a bomb in here! Y'all gotta get out! Now!
EVERYONE: - A bomb? - Huh? - Woah.
FINN: Mater, listen to me. The bomb is on ON HIS REARVIEW DISPLAY: We can see that a BOMB has been detected, anchored to Mater's air filter.
FINN: They knew you'd try to help McQueen. When we were knocked out they planted it in your air filter.
MATER: Mater! There you are! Mater turns. McQueen enters Pit Row, 100 yards away and closing in FAST.
MCQUEEN: Mater! There you are! Mater turns. McQueen enters Pit Row, 100 yards away and closing in FAST.
MATER: Stop right there!
MCQUEEN: Oh man, I've been so worried about The view of this scene through the window of a luxury box. Reveal Zundapp in the window's reflection. He's watching from inside. He's poised to push a DETONATOR BUTTON. As Zundapp's front tire approaches the detonator -
MATER: Don't come any closer!
MCQUEEN: Are you okay?
MATER: No, I'm not okay. Stay away from Mater PEELS OUT BACKWARDS, out onto the track.
MCQUEEN: No, wait. Wait!
MCQUEEN: Mater, wait! He breezes right through his pit, goes after Mater.
MCQUEEN: Mater, wait!
MATER: Stay back! If you get close to me, you gonna get hurt real bad!
MCQUEEN: I know I made you feel that way before, but none of that matters because we're best friends!
MATER: McQueen, you don't get it. I'm the Yes, Mater! You are the bomb! That's what I'm trying to say here. You've always been the bomb! And you'll always be the bomb.
MCQUEEN: Yes, Mater! You are the bomb! That's what I'm trying to say here. You've always been the bomb! And you'll always be the bomb.
MATER: Stay away!
MCQUEEN: No! Never! ON ZUNDAPP. He watches as McQueen SPEEDS UP.
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: Almost there. ON MCQUEEN. He's had enough screwing around. Here he comes.
MCQUEEN: I'm not.letting you.
MCQUEEN: .get away again! McQueen JUMPS FORWARD, in an attempt to grab Mater's HOOK -
MATER: ( TO HIMSELF )
MATER'S COMPUTER: Request acknowledged. TURBINE ROCKETS slide out of Mater.
MCQUEEN: Oh my gosh! BAWHOOOOOOM!!!!! Mater JOLTS forward with a rocket blast and disappears, taking McQueen with him. ON ZUNDAPP. He now freely PUSHES the detonator, but it says
FRANCESCO: What is happening? It's a bad NOW EVEN FARTHER UP THE TRACK - Mater takes a turn, SMASHES THROUGH A FENCE and skids around a corner out of sight. A white, smoky JET TRAIL is all that remains. IN MCQUEEN'S PIT - All of Radiator Springs watches the television monitors, dumbfounded.
TUBBS PACER: Someone's gotta get McQueen.
VLADIMIR TRUNKOV: Get McQueen!! Grem and Acer are already out the door -
FINN: Holley. I'll get Zundapp, you help EXT. TRACK - SAME Holley, still in the air, turns -
HOLLEY: Got it! FARTHER UP THE TRACK - Holley THUNDERS past Francesco and out of sight.
FRANCESCO: What is happening?!
COMBAT SHIP: Hurry, Professor! ON ZUNDAPP - With Finn gaining fast, he accelerates. Suddenly
FINN: Do you really think I'm going to let you float away, Professor? Finn reels him in. Zundapp spins his wheels, caught. Suddenly Zundapp miraculously, inconceivably, GAINS TRACTION! Now it's FINN'S WHEELS that are spinning. ON THE COMBAT SHIP - the ELECTROMAGNET has been turned outward and switched on. He's PULLING ZUNDAPP AND FINN IN with the magnetic force. He pulls out a laser, TARGETS it at Finn's windshield.
MATER: McQueen, let go!
MCQUEEN: They pass a Gremlin with a headset. ON GREM AND ACER - Down another side street. They get this message, take off in the opposite direction.
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: Give it up, McMissile! Finn releases a mess of bullets, grenades, and other weaponry into the air -
HOLLEY: Mater, stop!
MATER: No way! You could get hurt! Then she looks over, catches a glimpse of GREM AND ACER, bearing down on them from a side street. They're going to broadside Mater and McQueen.
HOLLEY: Oh no. ON MATER AND MCQUEEN - They're not aware of the impending Holley DROPS FROM THE SKY, hits the pavement, SKIDS into the path of the AMCs and DEFLECTS THEM. They FLIP OVER Holley, Finn and McQueen and sail -
HOLLEY: Mater, we've got to get that bomb off you.
MCQUEEN: Yeah, they strapped it to me to kill you as a back-up plan.
MATER: Yeah, they strapped it to me to kill you as a back-up plan.
MCQUEEN: Back-up plan? Mater, who put a bomb on you?
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: ( TO MCQUEEN )
MCQUEEN: Death ray?
FINN: Turn off the bomb, Zundapp!
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: Are you all so dense? It's voice- activated. Everything is voice- activated these days.
MATER: Deactivate! Deactivate!
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: Oops. Did I forget to mention that it can only be disarmed by the one who activated it? Holley immediately shoves a GUN in Zundapp's grill.
HOLLEY: Say it!
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: BOMB'S COMPUTER VOICE Voice denied. THE BOMB'S TIMER: It loses a full minute! Goes from 4:48 to 3:48 to 3:47. Mater GASPS.
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP: ( GRINNING )
FINN: ( TO HOLLEY )
HOLLEY: He was getting on my nerves.
MCQUEEN: What do we do?
VICTOR HUGO: You blow up. The four streets surrounding them are now blocked by each of the Lemonheads and their families.
MCQUEEN: ( TO MATER )
VLADIMIR TRUNKOV: It's nothing personal.
MATER: ( to the Lemons ) Fellers, listen.
MATER: - but becoming powerful and rich beyond your wildest dreams ain't gonna make you feel better.
GUIDO: Pit stop. The two Pacers' tires all FALL OFF. Flo hits VLADIMIR TRUNKOV with her high-beams, BLINDING HIM. Sheriff BOOTS him.
SHERIFF: Not today, boys! Guido pushes away his tireless thug, YELLING AT HIM IN
TUBBS PACER: A few Lemons turn back the way they came. BLOCKING THEIR PATH are a line of BRITISH MILITARY VEHICLES clad in digital camo, led by SARGE.
SARGE: Thanks for the help, Corporal.
BRITISH CORPORAL: Anything for one of pop's mates. And in the middle of all of this craziness we CUT TO - - MATER. WRENCH BITS are strewn all around him as Guido tries wrench after wrench to take the bolts off. No dice. Guido gestures wildly, spits Italian a mile a minute.
MCQUEEN: What's he saying?! What's wrong!?
LUIGI: None of his wrenches fit the bolts! This is a light bulb moment for Mater. He eyes the bolts.
MATER: I get it. I get it! I know what needs to be done.
MCQUEEN: Then do it!
MATER: What? No, I can't do it. Look, nobody takes me seriously. I know that now. This ain't Radiator Yes it is. Mater looks at McQueen. It is?
MCQUEEN: Yes it is. Mater looks at McQueen. It is?
MCQUEEN: You're yourself in Radiator Springs. Be yourself here. And if people aren't taking you seriously, then they need to change. Not you. I know that, because I was wrong before. Now you can do this. You're the bomb.
MATER: Thanks, buddy.
MCQUEEN: No no no, you're the actual bomb. Now let's go!
MATER: Oh, right! Hang on! Mater HOOKS McQueen and they're off. They SHOOT PAST FINN, who's in the middle of battling lemons.
FINN: Where's he going? ON MATER AND MCQUEEN - Flying down a side street.
MATER: MATER'S COMPUTER
MATER'S COMPUTER: Yes, Agent Mater.
MATER: I need that thing you done before to get me away from McQueen!
MATER'S COMPUTER: Request acknowledged. The ROCKET THRUSTERS kick in. They head right for a WALL.
MCQUEEN: Now I need you to do the chute, the second kind not the first!
MATER: Now I need you to do the chute, the second kind not the first!
MATER'S COMPUTER: Deploying chute. Mater's chute POPS OPEN, catching air and sending Mater and McQueen SAILING INTO THE AIR. Mater starts to steer them the direction he wants. He and McQueen are FLYING OVER LONDON.
QUEEN: Who's winning the race? Mater and McQueen drop from the sky. They land and skid to a halt just before the Queen's guards who DRAW THEIR WEAPONS.
QUEEN'S GUARD: Back up! Back away!
QUEEN: ( STAR-STRUCK )
QUEEN'S GUARDS: Get back!
MCQUEEN: No, no, it's okay! Tell them, Mater. Explain.
MATER: Okay! Somebody's been sabotaging the racers and hurting the cars and I know who. Oh wait. Your Mater BOWS to the Queen. In doing so, the TICKING TIME BOMB angles into view. The clock's at T-minus 1:53.
QUEEN'S GUARDS: - Bomb! - It's a bomb! - Everybody down! - Look out!
FINN: Mater, I don't know what you're doing but stand down now!
MATER: ( aside, to McQueen ) This ain't nothing at all like Radiator Springs.
MCQUEEN: Mater, just cut to the chase!
MATER: He turns to Miles Axlerod.
MATER: It's him.
MILES AXLEROD: What? Me? You've got to be crazy. Everyone exchanges confused looks, including Finn and Holley.
MATER: I figured it out when I realized you all attached this ticking time bomb with Whitworth bolts. The same bolts that hold together that old British engine from the photograph. Holley! Show that picture.
HOLLEY: Holley projects the much discussed PHOTO OF THE ENGINE.
MATER: And then I remembered what they say about old British engines - "If there ain't no oil under `em, there ain't no oil in `em."
MILES AXLEROD: What is he talking about?
MATER: It was you leaking oil at the party in Japan. You just blamed it on me.
MILES AXLEROD: Electric cars don't use oil, you Then you're faking it. You didn't convert to no electric. We pop that hood we gonna see that engine from that picture right there. Mater moves toward Miles Axlerod to pop his hood.
MATER: Then you're faking it. You didn't convert to no electric. We pop that hood we gonna see that engine from that picture right there. Mater moves toward Miles Axlerod to pop his hood.
MILES AXLEROD: This lorry's crazy. He's going to kill us all! Miles Axlerod BACKS UP to the edge of the stage.
MILES AXLEROD: Stay away!
HOLLEY: But Sir Axlerod created the race, Mater. Why would he want to hurt To make Allinol look bad so everybody'd go back to using oil. I mean, he said it himself with that disguised voice.
MATER: To make Allinol look bad so everybody'd go back to using oil. I mean, he said it himself with that disguised voice.
MILES AXLEROD: "Dee-sguised voice?" What are you talking about? You're nuts, you The QUEEN'S GUARDS have had ENOUGH. As has the PRINCE.
PRINCE WHEELIAM: This is going nowhere fast. We really should go, Grandmother.
QUEEN: One moment. I'd like to see where this is going.
FINN: Mater, he created Allinol.
MATER: Yeah, but what if he found that huge oil field just as the world was trying to find something else? Mater sticks his ticking bomb-nose into Miles Axlerod's What if he came up with Allinol just to make alternative fuel look "What if?" You're basing this on a "What if"?!
MATER: What if he came up with Allinol just to make alternative fuel look "What if?" You're basing this on a "What if"?!
MILES AXLEROD: "What if?" You're basing this on a "What if"?!
GUARD: Okay, that's it. And the QUEEN'S GUARDS spirit the Queen and Prince Wheeliam out of there FAST -
MILES AXLEROD: Wait! Somebody save me! The lorry's Now it's just Miles Axlerod, Mater, McQueen, Finn and Holley. Miles Axlerod's back tires slip on the edge of the podium as he is cornered by Mater.
MILES AXLEROD: Keep away, you idiot!
FINN: MILES AXLEROD
HOLLEY: MILES AXLEROD
MILES AXLEROD: Someone do something! Everyone FLINCHES, DUCKS or DIVES FOR COVER except McQueen, Mater and Axlerod -
MILES AXLEROD: You're insane, you are! The bomb FREEZES at 00:01.
FINN: The engine from the photo.
HOLLEY: It's a perfect match!
MILES AXLEROD: How did the tow truck figure it It's official. You're coming to all my races from now on.
MCQUEEN: ( TO MATER )
MATER: Now you're talking! Tire bump.
MCQUEEN: Mater, let's go. You're on.
LORD STEWARD: Your Majesty. May I present for the investiture of honorary Knighthood of the British Realm. Tow Mater of Radiator Springs.
MCQUEEN: Go get `em, buddy. McQueen joins his friends from Radiator Springs. Mater rolls forward. He bows, as if he's practiced it all day.
QUEEN: I hereby dub thee "Sir Tow Mater." Applause from all around.
MATER: ( LOOKS UP )
MATER: So there I was: rocket jets going full blast, McQueen hanging on for dear life when suddenly them two nasty lemons come out of nowhere, guns drawed. We was goners. But then out of nowhere, this beautiful spy car swoops in from the sky to save us!
MINNY: That's a very entertaining story, young man.
VAN: Oh, Minny, please. Come on, none of this happened. Rocket jets? Flying spy cars?
HOLLEY: No, you're quite right. It does sound a bit far-fetched. The crowd turns, sees HOLLEY, wings out, swooping in. FINN is right below her, driving up the street.
MATER: Holley! Finn!
HOLLEY: Hello, Mater. It's so nice to see you again.
MATER: What're you doing here?
FINN: Our satellites picked up an urgent So you got my e-mail.
LUIGI: So you got my e-mail.
MATER: Oh, man. Y'all is gonna have a great time. Everybody! This here's Finn McMissile. He's a secret Don't tell nobody. And this is Holley Shiftwell. She's -
HOLLEY: I'm Mater's girlfriend. It's so nice to meet you all. Everyone is shocked. Including Mater. Guido's jaw drops.
LUIGI: ( TO MATER )
FLO: ( TO HOLLEY )
VAN: ( already crushing on her ) Was that from when you swooped in and saved them in London?
MINNY: What? I'm just asking.
VAN: What? I'm just asking.
FLO: ( TO HOLLEY )
RAMONE: Yeah, sure thing. No problemo. Just let me go get my tools.
HOLLEY: Oh no no. I'm keeping that dent. It's way too valuable. Mater takes this in.
LIZZIE: A "valuable" dent? Oh, she's as crazy as Mater.
MACK: Those two are perfect for each You know, there's one thing I still don't get. The bad guys hit me with the beam from the camera, right? So why didn't I, you know.
MCQUEEN: You know, there's one thing I still don't get. The bad guys hit me with the beam from the camera, right? So why didn't I, you know.
MATER: Explode in a fiery inferno?
MCQUEEN: We couldn't figure that one out Our investigation proved that Allinol was actually gasoline. And Miles Axlerod engineered it so that when it got hit by the beam it would explode.
FINN: We couldn't figure that one out Our investigation proved that Allinol was actually gasoline. And Miles Axlerod engineered it so that when it got hit by the beam it would explode.
HOLLEY: Our investigation proved that Allinol was actually gasoline. And Miles Axlerod engineered it so that when it got hit by the beam it would explode.
MCQUEEN: Wait a second. Fillmore, you said my fuel was safe. McQueen turns to Fillmore. Everyone does.
FILLMORE: If you're implying that I switched out that rotgut excuse for alternative fuel with my all- natural, sustainable, organic biofuel just because I never trusted Axlerod, you're dead wrong, It was him.
SARGE: Once Big Oil, always Big Oil. Man.
FILLMORE: Tree hugger.
SHERIFF: The Radiator Springs Grand Prix is about to begin! All spectators clear the starting line! MCQUEEN heads up Main Street, other racers following.
LEWIS HAMILTON: Man, I can't wait to get rockin'. This is gonna be wicked.
JEFF GORVETTE: Yeah, we should do this every year.
MCQUEEN: I just figured, we never found out who the world's fastest car is. Plus: no press, no trophy. Just racing - the way I like it.
FRANCESCO: Francesco likes it like this too. McQueen SEES Sally. He and Francesco approach her.
MCQUEEN: Francesco. I'd like you to meet -
FRANCESCO: Signorina Sally. It is official: Lightning McQueen is the luckiest car in the world.
SALLY: ( SWOONING )
FRANCESCO: Which he will have to be to have a chance against Francesco today. Francesco turns to leave. As he's moving away:
FRANCESCO: See you at the finish line, Mc- Francesco STOPS.
FRANCESCO: What is that? McQueen has a new bumper sticker: "Ka-ciao, Francesco."
MCQUEEN: It's just something I had made up for the occasion.
FRANCESCO: Is good, McQueen. Very funny. It was funnier when I did it, but it's very funny. What are you going to do next? Are you going to take off your fenders? Try it. You'll like it. Francesco leaves. We stay with McQueen and Sally.
SALLY: So he's not so good-looking.
MCQUEEN: Yeah. Nice try.
SALLY: I'm serious.
MCQUEEN: That's why I love you, Sally. ( as he leaves ) Wish me luck.
SALLY: You don't need it! He drives off. Flo approaches Sally.
FLO: Mmm-mmm. That Francesco is fine- And those open wheels.
SALLY: And those open wheels.
FLO: I'm gonna have to go get myself some coolant.
MATER: Go McQueen!! Whoo-hoo!!! Holley gets an alert.
HOLLEY: Finn, time to go. Siddeley's gassed, geared and ready to fly. Finn starts to back up.
MATER: You're leaving already?
FINN: We've got another mission, Mater. Just stopped by here to "pick something up." They both eye Mater, expectantly.
MATER: Something tells me you're not talking about souvenir bumper Her Majesty asked for you personally, Mater.
FINN: Her Majesty asked for you personally, Mater.
MATER: But I told you all before. I'm not a spy.
HOLLEY: We know.
FINN: Spy or not, you're still the smartest, most honest chap we've ever met.
HOLLEY: Don't forget massively charming. Mater looks over at Holley. He looks touched.
MATER: Well, thanks. But as much fun as it was hanging with y'all, this. He looks over to his friends who watch the race, CHEER
MATER: This is home.
HOLLEY: That's alright, we understand. But I'll be back. You still owe me that first date.
FINN: If there's ever anything I can do for you, just let me know.
MATER: Well, I sure appreciate that, thank Actually. there is one thing.
MATER: He ROCKETS FORWARD, through the whole town. In doing so he GRABS A BROKEN DOWN OTIS, hooking him -
OTIS: - and TOSSING him right into Ramone's.
FRANCESCO: - until he approaches MCQUEEN.
MCQUEEN: ( KEEPING PACE )
MATER: ( KEEPING PACE )
MCQUEEN: I'll see you at the finish line, Not if I see you first! McQueen and Mater peel away from the rest of the racers, lead them off the road and into the dirt for another lap. The two friends are side by side when we FADE OUT.
MATER: Not if I see you first! McQueen and Mater peel away from the rest of the racers, lead them off the road and into the dirt for another lap. The two friends are side by side when we FADE OUT.
