COMMANDO: Written by Richard Tuggle
FINAL: April 18, 1985
"COMMANDO": BLACK SCREEN. One word explodes towards us with cold brutality: COMMANDO. It FADES. leaves us in darkness. And we HEAR a growing ROAR. a frightening RUMBLE.
FADE IN: EXT. SUBURBAN CUL-DE-SAC - DAY 1 TIGHT ON the churning compactor of a garbage truck. The CAMERA PULLS BACK and we SEE the truck, battered and olive-grey. A bored garbage man with a kerchief over his mouth hangs on the back of the truck as it moves along the street.
LAWSON: What's that?
WIFE: ( BARELY AWAKE )
LAWSON: On Tuesday?
WIFE: ( YAWNING )
LAWSON: INT. LAWSON'S HOUSE - PANTRY 3 He runs into the pantry, dragging several ungainly plastic trash bags.
A85: EXT. LAWSON'S HOUSE - DAY 4 The truck SOUND is CLOSER now. We can SEE it at the end of the long driveway. Lawson flings the green plastic bags into two battered and half-full metal cans, starts running down the Wait a minute, wait a minute!
LAWSON: ( SHOUTING )
LAWSON: I was afraid you'd miss me
COOKE: Don't worry-we won't. And they cut Lawson down, the bullets raking across his body and the cans.
FORRESTAL: You ain't seen nothin' yet. 8 Cont. CAMERA ADJUSTS TO SHOW us that Forrestal is just now closing the trunk of a big new Cadillac. He's showing it to Diaz, who nods and makes noncommital NOISES as Forrestal continues the hype.
A85: 8 Cont. CAMERA ADJUSTS TO SHOW us that Forrestal is just now closing the trunk of a big new Cadillac. He's showing it to Diaz, who nods and makes noncommital NOISES as Forrestal continues the hype.
FORRESTAL: ( as trunk closes ) Hear that sound? American workmanship. You think the Japanese invented that? Bullshit We did.sure, we lost it for a while-but we got 'it back. Diaz gets into the car.
FORRESTAL: Sure, get in.comfy, right? I know what you're gonna say. it's cloth. But take it from me-you don't want leather, it's hot, it cracks, it's trouble. And look at the head room.. .you're not gonna have a problem. Diaz starts the engine.
FORRESTAL: Go ahead, start it up. Hear that? That's power-that's performance .that's Jesus Christ Forrestal has said this last because Diaz has thrown the car into reverse, knocking down a big display.
FORRESTAL: ANOTHER ANGLE 9
A85: EXT. FISHING BOAT - NIGHT Dangling working lights illuminate the night. The tuna fleet is in.
BENNETT: That's all for me, Les. Les nods. Bennett steps off the boat, crosses over another boat and steps onto his boat.
BENNETT'S BOAT: Bennett starts his boat, revs the throttle, then pulls away from the other boats. The wind whips his hair as he cruises out into the night.
FULL SHOT: The boat moves away from us, then WHOOM, the boat EXPLODES into a fireball, sending debris high into the air.
A85: ANOTHER ANGLE 16
A85: NEW ANGLE 24 s Matrix sweeps up the intruder-his eleven-year-old daughter, JENNY. She laughs as he tickles her.
JENNY: Dad. Dad. put me down. She tickles him back on his neck and ribs.he laughs, puts her down.
MATRIX: I surrender, I surrender. He raises his hands, open, trusting. Instantly she attacks again, then runs like hell as he pursues her,
A85: INT. CABIN - DAY 27 Matrix goes to open the refrigerator in his cabin a stops. Taped to the door is a cutout of a heart: Jenny is peeking at Matrix from around the corner of the kitchen. He sees her, he smiles, and they meet and hug.
MATRIX: When I was a boy and rock and roll came to East Germany, the communists said it was subversive.
SANDWICH JENNY: BROUGHT HIM )
JENNY: You don't want to know. Suddenly Matrix gets an odd look on his face .he stands, cocks his head.
JENNY: What's wrong? He shushes her, puts his hand up to block the sun as he peers through the picture window. Now Jenny and the audience can SEE what matrix's keen senses have already heard-an approaching aircraft.
JENNY: You said you wouldn't go away again. You said you were through
MATRIX: I'm not going anywhere.
A85: 30 Cont.
JENNY: THE COPTER 31
MATRIX: THE COPTER 31
KIRBY 32: Kirby approaches the cabin.
KIRBY: ( CALLING OUT )
MATRIX: ( o.s. ) I know. Startled, Kirby whirls to see Matrix standing behind him.
KIRBY: Silent and smooth.just like He smiles and he and Matrix come together and shake hands.
MATRIX: I better be. You taught me. He affectionately squeezes Kirby's shoulder. Jenny comes out of the cabin toward the two men.
KIRBY: I need to talk to your dad, Jenny.
JENNY: No way, Jose. Matrix gives her a sharp look and Jenny grudgingly goes back inside. Kirby and Matrix begin to walk as clouds billow high above the mountaintops around them. REVISED - "COM.MANDO" - 4/22/85 9

KIRBY: Someone's killing your men.
MATRIX: ( STARTLED )
KIRBY: There must have been a leak. Lawson, Forrestal. Bennett have all been hit.
MATRIX: Who's doing it? X
KIRBY: You've made enemies all over the X world, John. It could be the Syrians, the South Africans, the Russians-or a terrorist group.
MATRIX: We were going to make a normal X life here.
KIRBY: You will.I promise. I'm going X into the city to coordinate with the Federal people. In the meantime, Jackson and Harris will stay with you. Matrix looks the two soldiers over.
MATRIX: They any good?
KIRBY: Real good.
A65: MATRIX - LATER 37 watches the chopper lift off and fly away. Jenny, subdued, comes out of the cabin.
JENNY: Is it bad?
MATRIX: I'm not leaving you. if that's what you mean.
JENNY: Then it can't be bad. She smiles. An intense look comes over Matrix's face, then In a BLUR, he sweeps up Jenny in his arms just before machine gun fire BLASTS the cabin. The VOLLEY OF FIRING SHATTERS the windows and RIPS OPEN Harris' chest, his blood SPLATTERING against the cabin. .Matrix, still clutching Jenny, DIVES through the door into the cabin and HITS the floor. Jackson CATCHES a round in the shoulder, SPINS to the ground, then crawls through the door after Matrix. The three of them lie on the cabin floor as the FIRING CONTINUES to BLAST AWAY at Harris' body, the rounds SMACKING into the side of the cabin. Then the firing stops. Silence.

MATRIX: ( WHISPERING )
A85: 37 Cont.
JACKSON: ( WHISPERING )
MATRIX: I did. Matrix and Jenny move low to the floor toward her bedroom.
MATRIX: ( WHISPERING )
JENNY 40: hears a THUMP and sticks her head out from under her bed to look, but sees nothing. Suddenly, footsteps approach her bedroom door. She pulls her head back under the bed just as two boots enter her bedroom. A knife is attached to one of the boots.
A85: INT. CABIN - DAY 42 Matrix, H&K rifle held ready, silently enters, then moves carefully through the cabin. He peers into the den and sees Diaz, one of the men who killed Matrix's men, sitting in a chair, looking at Jenny's
QÏ¿½91: Matrix steps forward and points his rifle directly at Where is she? Diaz smiles and puts his feet up on a table.
MATRIX: Where is she? Diaz smiles and puts his feet up on a table.
DIAZ: Mellow out, man. We can't talk business with you waving guns in people's faces. Matrix puts the rifle against Diaz's forehead and COCKS the trigger. The smile vanishes from Diaz's face.
DIAZ: She's safe, Major. Whether she stays that way.is up to you. My people got some business with you. Matrix hears a NOISE outside, glances out the window and sees two vehicles RACING away from the house.
DIAZ: .and if you want your kid back, you gotta cooperate. Matrix levels the H&K and BLASTS Diaz in the chest. Diaz and the chair are JERKED violently backward.
MATRIX: Matrix levels the H&K and BLASTS Diaz in the chest. Diaz and the chair are JERKED violently backward.
A85: 43 Cont. He looks down the mountain and sees the vehicles winding along the mountain roads. Matrix slams the Blazer's hood.gets inside.puts his weapons on the seat.then releases the brake. Then, one hand on the wheel, the other on the door frame, he begins to push the car. He steers it not towards the dirt road, but towards the shoulder where a steep incline leads downward. Since the Blazer is pointed the wrong way, Matrix is pushing it uphill-the effort is incredible. the veins on his neck stand out.with a SCREAM, he puts everything he's got into it. and finally it begins to roll downwards. Matrix leaps in. Snaps on the driver's shoulder belt. reaches over and wraps the passenger belt around his body as well. The Blazer rolls over the edge.
A8 5: THE OTHER VEHICLE 51 o.s. of this mishap, rushing down the road.
MATRIX 54: Matrix ELBOWS him in the stomach, DRIVES his fist into the man's Adam's apple, PULLS HIM DOWN, CRACKS the man's vertebrae, grabs the dead man's rifle and SLAMS the butt against the face on the man closing on him. The man's jaw SHATTERS. But three more men are immediately on Matrix and they wrestle him to the ground. He forces his way up again, the three men still all over him. Matrix's eyes suddenly WIDEN as he looks at two boots with an attached knife, then up at the man standing in them. It's Bennett, the man we saw die!
MATRIX: ( STUNNED )
BENNETT: He FIRES at point-blank range. Matrix is BLASTED backward to the ground.
A85: INT. PORT TERMINAL TRANSPORT BUILDING - DAY Bennett and GENERAL ERNESTO ARIUS ( in guerrila fatigues ) walk through a large warehouse filled with tanks, jeeps and soldiers carrying bazookas, machine guns, mortars, etc. It looks like a small army.
SPECIAL EFFECT: An intense white light SHIMMERS at the CAMERA, almost as if the light were floating on water. It is so BRIGHT it hurts our eyes.
DAY: Matrix's motionless body is lying on a slab of a table. His eyes slowly open as he looks at the same BRIGHT LIGHT. That light in on the ceiling of the small room he is lying in. Matrix groggily shakes his head, sits up a little and sees Bennett holding up the bulky gun.
BENNETT: General Arius approaches Matrix.
ARIUS: Remember me, Major?
MATRIX: I remember the people you tortured and killed.
ARIUS: You don't understand a country like Val Verde, Major. It needs a president with an iron hand. It needs my hand again.
MATRIX: Why tell me?
ARIUS: Because you're going to return to Val Verde and kill the president you helped to overthrow me. 57 Cont.

BENNETT: You trained me, Major.
ARIUS: ( TO MATRIX )
MATRIX: And if I don't? Arius looks at Matrix for a beat, then Arius nods to Bennett opens a sliding door to a closet and matrix sees She is gagged and tied tightly to a chair. She is shaking from fear and her eyes are wet with tears. Matrix LUNGES up from the table, but his hands and feet are chained to the table and he is STOPPED. Bennett wheels Jenny out of the closet over to Arius. Arius begins to finger her hair.
ARIUS: So pretty-There are many things I'm going to teach her. 57 Cont.l Matrix FIGHTS at the chains like a crazy man, but he can't move. Arius fingers the shirt collar around her neck.
A85: 57 Cont.l Matrix FIGHTS at the chains like a crazy man, but he can't move. Arius fingers the shirt collar around her neck.
ARIUS: You kill Velasquez, Major, and you'll get her back. You try anything else.

TERMINAL - DAY 62 The three of them pass through the terminal. Matrix looks toward two police officers that are right next to them, but he remains silent. Henriques, Matrix and Sully walk through the X-ray booths as the security guard watches, then they continue on.
SULLY: Have some beers in Val Verde, Matrix, it'll give everyone more time with your daughter. Matrix looks down at the bill, then up at Sully.

Matrix edgily looks around the plane. The Stewardess approaches him.

BAR 101: New Wave music PLAYS as valley gals and sharp dudes dance and mingle about. Sully can dig this scene he puts his dark glasses back on. He sits at a table, puts the briefcase next to his leg and orders a drink. A LATIN MAN wearing a leisure suit, looking completely out of place in a joint like this, enters the bar, and stares at a girl with purple hair. He continues into the bar, catches Sully's eye and sits down at the table with him. He reaches under the table and slides the briefcase away from Sully until its next to himself, then hands Sully, still under the table, a bunch of passports.
BAR: Cindy enters the bar, then sees a young security guard, CATES, coming out of the men's room. She moves around a corner so Matrix can't see her and she stops the There's a huge guy across the way who either honestly needs my help or he's an escaped mental fruitcake. Take a look. Cates moves into the doorway, casually glances at Matrix watching the bar, then Cates moves out of Matrix's view. He removes the walkie-talkie from his belt and speaks into it.
