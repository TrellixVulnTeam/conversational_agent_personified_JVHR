DANIEL: ( to Sami ) This is Zero.
SAMI: Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five.
JULIEN: Let me give you some advice. You don't want to piss him off because he'll kill you for the fun of it. What you want to do is keep your mouth shut and do what we tell you.

BASTALDI: ( to Daniel ) I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage. and tell you that Marcel will be going with you.
DANIEL: This is a considerable move up for you, Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you.
BASTALDI: This is a considerable move up for you, Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you.
DANIEL: You don't trust me?
BASTALDI: I don't trust anyone. You don't get to the top of this game by trusting people. and after all, you are a thief. It's in your nature to steal. I'm just protecting my investment.
MARCEL: That's better.
BASTALDI: Stop it! Both of you!

LAMAR: Now, are you going to give me the suitcases? Or are we going to have to take them?
ZERO: Va te faire foutre!
LAMAR: What did he say?
DANIEL: He said to go fuck yourself.
ZERO: We are tired and bored with your bullshit. So, put that stupid little knife away before Zero shoves it up your ass.
LAMAR: Who is Zero?
JULIEN: He is.
LAMAR: ( to Julien ) He speaks about himself in the third
LAMAR: Maybe Zero would like to get off his ass and take my knife from me?
ZERO: If you insist.
ZERO: Leave now before Zero shoots off those little raisins you call balls.
SAMI: You put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? How stupid is that?
ZERO: Zero did not put it in his bag. He put it in yours.
MARCEL: We are looking for Sophie. Laurant send
SAMI: ( softly ) Ouh La La.
SOPHIE: I wasn't expecting this many of you. I've got a few sleeping bags you can
SAMI: Of to the side, sitting on the couch is WAYNE, 20's, a burn-out with long hair and a scraggly goatee. His face is buried in a bong as he sucks in a lung full of marijuana. He watches a cartoon show on the television.
SOPHIE: ( to all of them ) This is Wayne. My roommate.
RAYMOND: I am Raymond. Thank you for allowing us to stay here.
WAYNE: No problem, man. Hey, you wanna hit?
RAYMOND: No thank you.
RAYMOND: Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and quite well known in France.
WAYNE: Yeah, I dig him.
RAYMOND: Although a cartoon I feel he shares a universal theme: We are all searching for love. No?
WAYNE: Whoa. That's deep.
SOPHIE: You guys hungry?
WAITRESS: Ready to order?
JULIEN: Could we see a wine list please?
WAITRESS: ( smirks ) That's cute.
SOPHIE: They don't have a wine list.
JULIEN: Oh, then we will have the house wine.
WAITRESS: Sure and would you like that before your escargot in white truffle sauce?
JULIEN: I did not order escargot.
SAMI: They don't serve wine here.
JULIEN: What kind of restaurant doesn't serve This kind.
SAMI: This kind.
JULIEN: Okay. I will have a beer.

JULIEN: ( to the others ) C'est quoi root beer?
DANIEL: He'll have a sprite. We'll all have Good. Now that we've gotten the beverage selection out of the way, dare we move on to the main course?
WAITRESS: Good. Now that we've gotten the beverage selection out of the way, dare we move on to the main course?

WAITRESS: And no smoking.
ZERO: ( in French ) No smoking? No drinking? What kind of country is this?
VINNY: ( frightened ) I'm sorry, Frankie. Really.
ZAMMITO: You bleed on me, I'll kill ya.
ZAMMITO: What'd I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What'd I tell you when you came to me for money? Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I not say that? What'd I say to him?
ZAMMITO: That's right. I said don't do it. Did you listen to me? No. You wanted the money. So, I lent you twenty large. Now it's been three weeks and you ain't paid a dime. What do you think that makes me look like on the street? I don't do something to you and everyone will think they can skate.
VINNY: Frankie, I
ZAMMITO: Shut up! Don't you try to make me feel bad about this. You knew what would happen to you if you didn't pay. This is on your head, not mine. Break his arm.
VINNY: Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!
ZAMMITO: That's why we're only breaking one arm.
SOPHIE: There's an exterior alarm system. There's also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector. The control panel is in the bedroom.
JULIEN: I can handle the exterior alarm, but the one in the bedroom is a problem.
SAMI: After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.
DANIEL: ( impressed ) Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door.
JULIEN: What about transportation?
SOPHIE: You can use my car.
DANIEL: Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you'll steal one.
RAYMOND: No problem.
SAMI: When do we go?
SOPHIE: I know they won't be home tonight.
DANIEL: I know they won't be home tonight.

SOPHIE: I've asked them a hundred times to keep in down. They don't listen.
RAYMOND: I will talk to them.

ZAMMITO: Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards.
ZAMMITO: Oh and uh, send a case of steaks over to his house. I don't want the kids to go hungry while he's recuperating.
SOPHIE: You like shoes?
SAMI: No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.

SOPHIE: So, how did you get hooked up with these Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
SAMI: Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
SOPHIE: The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information.

MARCEL: There has to be.
JULIEN: I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.

ZAMMITO: You know why I'm handling it very well? Because you're going to get these guys for me.
ZAMMITO: If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you?
ZAMMITO: Just find them!

SOPHIE: Sounds boring.
SAMI: It's three in the morning. Not much else to do.
SOPHIE: I can think of something.

WAYNE: No you didn't, dude. You were bangin' Sophie. I saw you guys going at it.
DANIEL: You slept with her?
SAMI: Well, actually I would say she slept with me.
SAMI: What's the big deal? It's not like I was on guard duty or something.
DANIEL: You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
SAMI: No. Chicks dig me.
MAN'S VOICE: ZAMMITO'S VOICE
ZAMMITO'S VOICE: It's me. I need an answer from you if I'm going to move.
MAN'S VOICE: We're not just talkin' about a 'piece of work' here. We're talking about a boss.
SAMI: Holy shit.
RAYMOND: Sami holds his hand signaling them to be quiet so he can hear the A pause on the line.
ZAMMITO'S VOICE: Bonanno's a dinosaur. Guy thinks he's fuckin' Vito Corleone or something. The old ways are gone. If we don't change now we're going to get pushed out. I need to know if I can count on your
MAN'S VOICE: The line goes dead. Sami leans back.
SAMI: No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war.
JULIEN: This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war.
MARCEL: The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is.
DANIEL: You know, if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you.
JULIEN: I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself?
SAMI: Yeah, but you did do it. So let's deal with that.
MARCEL: What are you guys so scared of? Zammito doesn't know who we are. We just get out of town and it's over.
ZERO: Oh, you think it's that easy?
RAYMOND: Yeah. We just go home.
DANIEL: We can't.
RAYMOND: I agree with Marcel. I say we go to the airport and get on a plane.
SAMI: They'll be waiting for us at the airport.
DANIEL: You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
SAMI: We have to find Sophie.
RAYMOND: How are we going to do that?
WAYNE: I know where she went.
WAYNE: I heard her talking on the phone. Bay View Motel. It's about five blocks from
RAPHAEL: Tell me the truth Hector. do you think we'll find my car?
HECTOR: Hard to say.
RAYMOND: How do we know what room she's in?
SAMI: Wait here.
SAMI: Hi. Did a woman just check in? She's about five six. Pretty. Dark hair.
MOTEL CLERK: I can't give out information on our C'mon man, I think she's having an affair.
SAMI: C'mon man, I think she's having an affair.
MOTEL CLERK: So are half the people in this place. I can't help you, pal.
MOTEL CLERK: Look, I can't tell you
MOTEL CLERK: Room fourteen.
ZERO: Thank you.
SAMI: I really thought we had something special going. I can't tell you what a disappointment you've turned out to be.
SOPHIE: After last night I could say the same for you.
RAYMOND: The money isn't here.
SAMI: Where is it, Sophie?
SOPHIE: I don't know.
DANIEL: If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again.
SAMI: Who are you waiting for?
SOPHIE: Stick around and find out.
ZERO: He's FBI.
RAYMOND: What is she doing with an agent du FBI?
SAMI: We've been set up.
SAMI: We didn't go to the wrong house. We went to right one, didn't we Sophie?
SAMI: They send us to Zammito's house. The FBI is right across the street watching the whole thing, but they don't move. A crime is going down and they don't move. Because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us.
ZERO: What does arresting us get them?
SAMI: ( to Hadley ) You wanna tell him?
AGENT HADLEY: You're telling it fine.
DANIEL: You see my friend over there? I nod to him and he's going to put a bullet in your knee. You wouldn't.
AGENT HADLEY: You wouldn't.
AGENT HADLEY: That's going to make a lot of noise. Not much time for a conversation after you pull the trigger.
SAMI: He's got a point.
AGENT HADLEY: Okay! Okay! We've been investigating Zammito for years, but we've never had enough evidence for a warrant to search his house. We got word through a snitch that Zammito was planning on taking Bonanno out.
DANIEL: We know all this.
AGENT HADLEY: You just don't take out a boss. You need permission from the other families to do something like that. Our informant told us that Zammito was talking with other bosses and recording their conversations in case they later claimed they weren't involved. Look at these tapes. The guy has recorded every conversation he's had for years.
DANIEL: So we rob Zammito. You arrest us when we come out and the contents of the safe is now evidence which you can use against
SAMI: ( to Sophie ) What are you getting out of this?
SOPHIE: Money. It was supposed to simple. In and out.
ZAMMITO: Mario, I gotta go. When my date arrives will you explain to her I had an Of course, Mr. Zammito.
MARIO: Of course, Mr. Zammito.
SOPHIE: Hi. I'm meeting Frankie Zammito
SAMI: Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.
SOPHIE: Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.
DANIEL: For what?
SOPHIE: Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
DANIEL: What kind of business?
SOPHIE: Black market art. Zammito got to a few key security guards at the Metropolitan Museum. The Bastaldi's supplied the artists to make copies of famous works. They'd switch the paintings, send the originals to Paris and the Bastaldi's would sell them to private collectors.
AGENT HADLEY: We're talking Matisse, Renoir, Monet. We know for sure they replaced Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve sunflowers" last week with a copy. It was on loan from the London National Gallery and they're not going to be very happy when they find out about it.
SAMI: So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother?
AGENT HADLEY: Yeah. He delivers the goods on Zammito. If we got what we wanted we'd let his brother go providing he tells us where the Van Gogh and the other paintings No one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison.
RAYMOND: No one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison.
DANIEL: We're leaving. Raymond get the bag.
AGENT HADLEY: You walk out with that bag and you won't only have Zammito and his people after you. You'll have the entire United States justice department. How far do you think you'll get? I know who you are Mr. Foray? Mr. Zerhouni. Mr. Gayet.
SOPHIE: Zero. That's all I know.
AGENT HADLEY: You'll never get out of the city.
DANIEL: Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!
ZERO: You want Zero to kill him?
DANIEL: I'm going to kill him myself!
ZERO: What about the money?
SAMI: It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't have time to go anywhere else before she came here.
ZERO: We don't know that for sure.
DANIEL: Forget the money! We've got bigger problems than the money right now.
RAYMOND: She probably hid it at her place. The six of us could find it in
SAMI: ( overlapping ) We don't have time to look for it. Hadley's first move is going to be to look for us there.
DANIEL: We're moving. Pack up and be on the street in five minutes.
AGENT HADLEY: This is turning to shit. If word gets out of my involvement in this I'll go to Listen, we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI.
SOPHIE: Listen, we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI.
AGENT HADLEY: I can't bring the Bureau into this. If I do the tapes become evidence.
SOPHIE: They're supposed to be evidence. That's why Bastaldi set this up.
AGENT HADLEY: Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back?
SOPHIE: I thought you wanted Zammito?
AGENT HADLEY: What for? The minute I get him some other Gavone will take his place. I've been doing this for twenty years. When I retire it's not going to be to some trailer park in the suburbs.
AGENT HADLEY: Too many people know about my involvement in this.
SOPHIE: Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything.
AGENT HADLEY: You're right about that.
RAYMOND: I would like to thank you for your If you are ever in Paris here is my
WAYNE: Marcel grabs Raymond and leads him back to the car. Daniel sees Lamar standing across the street.
DANIEL: ( to the others ) I'll be right back.
LAMAR: What do you want now?
DANIEL: Guns. Can you get them?
LAMAR: Man, I can get anything.
DANIEL: Don't bullshit me.
LAMAR: I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that I've got a way with people.
DANIEL: I've got a way with people.
LAMAR: I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?
DANIEL: I'm from Belgium.
LAMAR: Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you.
DANIEL: Why haven't you turned us in?
LAMAR: I ain't no rat. You got money, right?
LAMAR: And, uh, I'm going to have to charge you a commission. kind of like a brokerage How much?
DANIEL: How much?
LAMAR: A thousand dollars?
DANIEL: Daniel hands him his cell phone.
DANIEL: Take this. I'll call you in a few hours. You tell me where we meet.
WAYNE: Hadley pushes past Wayne and enters.
WAYNE: Hey dude, what do you think you're doing?
WAYNE: Uh. excuse me, but don't you need a warrant or something?
AGENT HADLEY: Not today. Where are your friends?
WAYNE: They left about a half hour ago.
AGENT HADLEY: Where did they go?
WAYNE: I dunno.
WAYNE: Hey man, you can't do that!
AGENT HADLEY: What? This?
AGENT HADLEY: Or this?
WAYNE: Jesus. What kind of FBI agent are you?
AGENT HADLEY: I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me, where did they go?
WAYNE: I swear man, I don't know. They packed up and left a half hour ago. All I got is one of their phone numbers in Paris.
MAID: Maid service.
RAYMOND: ( in French ) I know Mama, but I couldn't call you yesterday we were very busy. ( listens ) No, nothing's more important than you. ( listens ) I don't know. I think I'm going to have to stay a few more days.
DANIEL: ( to Marcel ) Did you know about Bastaldi's deal with You're sure?
MARCEL: You're sure?
DANIEL: You're sure?
MARCEL: I think if he told me he was going to steal Van Gogh's "Sunflowers in a vase" I would remember it.
SAMI: ( correcting him ) "Vase with twelve Sunflowers."
MARCEL: Whatever! He never told me about the Van Gogh or any of the other paintings.
SAMI: It makes sense. I mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?
DANIEL: I think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi told him to.
MARCEL: Fuck you! You know I'd never go along with something like this.
DANIEL: Do I?
MARCEL: This ain't about that and you know it. This is about you never forgiving me for leaving the crew.
SAMI: ( surprised ) You guys used to work together?
MARCEL: Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.
DANIEL: ( in French ) You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?
MARCEL: ( in French ) Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the All right, knock it off.
SAMI: All right, knock it off.
DANIEL: ( in French ) All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
MARCEL: ( in French ) I'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you're testing ( in French ) What is that a threat? Are you fuckin' threatening me, Marcel?
DANIEL: ( in French ) What is that a threat? Are you fuckin' threatening me, Marcel?
SAMI: I said knock it off! Now as far as I'm concerned you two girls can bitch slap yourselves silly when this is over, but right now we've got to figure out what's going on.
RAYMOND: It's simple. Bastaldi's moving up. He's closing down his operation and this is his way of saying thanks to all of Well, I say the whole deal is off. In fact, if you ask me, there never was a deal because we were screwed from the

DANIEL: Has to be.
JULIEN: ( freaking out ) This is bad. This is really fuckin' bad. Am I the only one who sees how bad this is?
SAMI: Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool.
JULIEN: Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia. the FBI. the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone, have I? I don't think so, because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city!
SAMI: We've got to get out of here.
JULIEN: That's brilliant! Care to elaborate?
SAMI: You're not helping.
RAYMOND: Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us.
JULIEN: Oh, Jesus. We're dead.

DANIEL: Sami, tomorrow you lift a wallet from someone who looks like one of us.
JULIEN: What for?
DANIEL: We need to rent a car and for that you need a credit card.
RAYMOND: Why not just steal another one?
DANIEL: Too risky. We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.
JULIEN: Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why aren't we leaving town? Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago.
SAMI: It doesn't matter where we go. Between Zammito and the FBI they'll find us. We have to end this here.
ZERO: And how do we do that?
SAMI: I don't know.
JULIEN: That's an excellent plan. Very We'll think of something.
DANIEL: We'll think of something.
BONANNO: Why didn't you tell me about this?
ZAMMITO: You have enough to worry about, Angelo. You don't need my problems. We're family. An insult to you is an insult to me.
BONANNO: We're family. An insult to you is an insult to me.
BONANNO: They knew who you were when they broke in your house?
ZAMMITO: What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?
BONANNO: What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?

DANIEL: How much for the nines?
ELLWOOD: A grand a piece.
DANIEL: I'll need extra clips and ammo.
LAMAR: What the hell you doing, Ellwood? I gave them my word.
ELLWOOD: Zammito's offering twenty grand a head for these guys. You think I'm going to settle for four G's when I can make forty? All right. Reach in easy and put the gun on the floor.
ELLWOOD: I said put it on the floor, not kick it under the bed.

ANGIE: I've gained weight.
ZAMMITO: Yeah, well, it suits you.

ANGIE: ( flatly ) Gee, five bucks. What ever shall we

VINNY: You gonna forget about the money I owe What are you nuts? A debt is a debt. I was thinking I'd throw a little extra work your way. You know, you come down to the club, make espresso for the boys. wash their cars. run some errands. things like that.

JULIEN: ( in French ) I'll drive.
RAYMOND: ( in French ) I'm the driver.
JULIEN: ( in French ) I've never driven a Cadillac before.
JULIEN: ( in French ) This is a car. I think this is the best American car I've ever driven.
RAYMOND: ( in French ) This is the only American car you've ever driven.
SAMI: You set me up, you piece of shit!
SAMI: What are you doing?
AGENT HADLEY: You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
SAMI: Wired? I ain't wired.
AGENT HADLEY: Okay. Okay. I believe you.

AGENT HADLEY: No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
SAMI: Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
AGENT HADLEY: You're fucked, Sami. You know it. That's why you're here.
SAMI: Look, I just want out of this nightmare. I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted.
AGENT HADLEY: Where are the tapes?
SAMI: I can get them but what do I get if I A pass.
AGENT HADLEY: A pass.
SAMI: A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
AGENT HADLEY: Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
SAMI: They don't have a murder weapon?
AGENT HADLEY: No. I have it. The lamp? The one with your fingerprints and her blood on it?
AGENT HADLEY: Of course they could always get an anonymous tip. Find it in the dumpster behind the motel.
SAMI: You want the tapes for yourself. You're going to sell them.
AGENT HADLEY: I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
SAMI: You didn't have to kill Sophie.
AGENT HADLEY: Yes I did. Lose ends are messy.
SAMI: What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
AGENT HADLEY: When this is over you can say whatever the hell you want. I'll be long gone. Besides, who's going to believe you? You're just a two-bit crook.
SAMI: And you're a dirty cop. At least I don't pretend to be something different than what I am.
AGENT HADLEY: When you've got the tapes call me on this number. We'll make the exchange and that'll be the end of it.

RAYMOND: ( in French ) I'm not going to leave you.
JULIEN: ( in French ) We both know I'm already dead.
JULIEN: ( in French )
DANIEL: Raymond's face fills with sadness. He shakes his.
SAMI: It's not your fault, Daniel.

RAYMOND: He's right. Do you have any idea what Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve Sunflowers" is worth?

DANIEL: We still have to get out of here.
MARCEL: Maybe if we gave the tapes back
ZERO: ( strongly )
ZERO: They killed our friend. It's personal now. Besides, if we do that, then Julien died for nothing. The tapes are the He's right. The tapes give us leverage with Bastaldi.
SAMI: He's right. The tapes give us leverage with Bastaldi.

ZAMMITO: Try to get this through that fat, stupid fuckin' head of yours. If Half Tooth Tony finds these guys before we do and Bonanno knows what was in my safe we are all dead.
ZAMMITO: He looks over at Eddie who is only half way to the table.

DANIEL: Can I trust you, Sami?
SAMI: Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
DANIEL: If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.

SAMI: Does it really matter what I say?
DANIEL: I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.

ZAMMITO'S VOICE: Of course. I need an answer from you if I'm going to move.
MAN'S VOICE: We're not just talkin' about a 'piece of work' here Frankie. We're talking about a boss.
ZAMMITO'S VOICE: Bonanno's a dinosaur.
DANIEL: I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This guy's an idiot. How he's lived this long is a mystery.
BONANNO: ( seething ) I don't think it will be a mystery much He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.

BONANNO: I only ask so I can call you when the arrangements are made.
DANIEL: How about if I call you?
SAMI: Same place. One hour.
SAMI: What the fuck was all that about at the hotel last night? I thought we had a Hey, you're not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world. I took a shot. It didn't work. Did you bring the tapes?
AGENT HADLEY: Hey, you're not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world. I took a shot. It didn't work. Did you bring the tapes?
SAMI: The lamp?
AGENT HADLEY: Just a second. You must think I'm a real moron.
ZAMMITO'S VOICE: I just came by to tell that "piece of work" you asked for on Johnny Wicks It's done.
BONANNO'S VOICE: Good. How'd he go?
ZAMMITO'S VOICE: Like the crying rat bastard that he was.

AGENT HADLEY: I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
SAMI: You didn't have to kill Sophie.
AGENT HADLEY: Yes I did. Lose ends are messy.
SAMI: It's a little arty I know, but it has great content, don't you think? You were so busy looking for a wire you probably didn't even think about a video camera. It was on the statue. Anyway, I've sent a copy of the whole tape to the Chicago P.D. and the FBI. They'll get it tomorrow. If I were you I'd take the day off.
EDDIE: Hey boss, some guy named Hadley. Says he's got some tapes you want?

ZAMMITO: Yeah. It's mine.
RAPHAEL: No. It's mine.
ZAMMITO: The hell it is.
RAPHAEL: I'm telling you that's my car! And someone's gonna pay for it!
ZAMMITO: And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.
RAPHAEL: Fuck you, grease-ball!
ZAMMITO: Fuck me? Fuck you!
RAYMOND: What's he doing?
MARCEL: He's looking around for us.
ZERO: Zero can't stay like this much longer. His leg is hurting.
BASTALDI: DANIEL ( V.O. ) ( in French )
BASTALDI: ( in French ) Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has been a big
BASTALDI: ( in French ) A million! I don't have that kind of ( in French ) Don't bullshit me, Laurant! I know about the Van Gogh.
BASTALDI: ( In French ) I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back.
DANIEL: ( in French ) Put the money in the rowboat and untie it. The current will carry it down river. When we see that the money is there I'll call back and tell you where the tapes
DANIEL: This is for Julien.
BASTALDI: Oh, Merde!
SAMI: Did you have to use that much explosive?
DANIEL: I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.
DANIEL: You didn't check it?
MARCEL: I'm sorry! I was caught up in the excitement of the moment. I should have checked. I made a mistake. I suppose that none of you have ever made a mistake
SAMI: This is great. After everything we've been through we've got eight hundred euros and an autographed baseball.
MARCEL: The baseball is mine.
SAMI: No! You can't have the baseball! You're not entitled to the fuckin' baseball!
MARCEL: I'm the one who took it. It's my If you say baseball one more time Zero will shoot you.
ZERO: If you say baseball one more time Zero will shoot you.
MARCEL: Raymond, don't you think they're over reacting a little?
RAYMOND: No. I think they have a right to express their anger with you in light of the fact that you're.
MARCEL: Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry. but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
SAMI: Give it to me, Sami.
MARCEL: Give it to me, Sami.
SAMI: Marcel tries to take the ball out of the bag. Sami pulls it away. Marcel grabs the bag. Both of them tug on it. Marcel pulls hard and the bag rips down the seam. The baseball falls out and rolls off the bridge into the river.
SAMI: Marcel stands there holding the inside liner of the bag. Sami throws the canvas bag to the ground in frustration. Something catches Daniel's attention. DANIEL'S POV of the black canvas. The lining has been ripped away. A light breeze blows lifting the underside of the black canvas. There is a flash of color. Another gust of wind turns the black canvas over. On the other side is Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve sunflowers". Daniel's jaw drops. The others notice his stunned expression and follow his stare. THEIR POV of the priceless painting. They stand there, too shocked to move at first, then rush forward. They have almost reached the painting when a truck passes them. The wind kicks up the painting, blowing it over the railing. They reach out to grab it, but it is too far away. They stand there, watching as it slowly floats down to the river below.
