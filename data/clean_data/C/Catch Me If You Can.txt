JOE SHAYE: Let me ask you something, Amdursky. if you had so much fun working undercover, why did you transfer into bank fraud?
AGENT AMDURSKY: I didn't transfer. I was demoted. ( off Joe's look ) Demoted is the wrong word. It was more like-punished. I screwed up in the field.
JOE SHAYE: What about you, Mr. Fox? Did you fuck up in the field and get punished?
FOX: No. I've never worked in the field before. I was in the L.A. public relations office, but we were shut down after the riots.
JOE SHAYE: That's just great. I ask for backup, they drag the bottom of the Pacific.
