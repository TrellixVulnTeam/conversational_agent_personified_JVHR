HASARI: I'll send money soon.
HASARI'S MOTHER: Don't let the children out of your sight. Not for a moment.
HASARI'S MOTHER: Help your parents. Don't fight with each other. And, Manooj, stay away from the cinema, do you hear?
HASARI'S FATHER: A man's journey to the end of his obligations is a very long road. Yours begins here.
MANOOJ: (to his neighbor) Our farm has died, so we are moving to Calcutta to become rich!
VEEJAY: (passing the flask)
GANGOOLY: (smile widens)
RAVI: I hope this is all right. The room hasn't been aired or the bed turned, but --
VEEJAY: Oh, he doesn't care about that, do you, Max? Here, look here.
VEEJAY: Help yourself. Be comfortable. Ravi, come on, go, go, let's leave the young man to himself.
PORTER: It pleases you?
MAX: No fruit basket? No mini bar?
PORTER: Bar? Of course -- many, many. But make care, Sahib. Please, for me. If it is lady you like to know -- yes? -- you let me. Huh? Very sweet girl, good nature, very sweet. Or boy, very good...
PORTER: No like boy? Something then for smoke -- mmmh, very good for smoke!
PORTER: Maybe you like two girls -- look a little Chinese, but very great pleasure.
HASARI: (a beat)
RAFIK (BOY): Why live like a beggar when you can live like a maharajah?
HASARI: I thought you were only taking a little.
ATTENDANT: We pay more, we take more.
HASARI: I'm feeling a little dizzy.
ATTENDANT: It'll pass.
MAX: (she doesn't get it)
MAX: (she doesn't get it)
MAX: Well well. Seek punishment and ye shall find.
ARUN: Don't go -- what are you doing?
HASARI: It sounds like someone needs help.
HASARI: What are you doing? (calling back) A man's being beaten here!
MAX: (checking out his accommodations)
MAX: (as Hasari nods)
MAX: What was that -- a Shetland pony?
JOAN: I would have to inspect it more closely, but I believe that was one of our economy-size rats.
JOAN: Watch your --
MAX: Thanks -- got it.
MAX: Pardon the expression, but Jesus H. Christ.
JOAN: (to Max)
ASHOKA: (to Hasari)
HASARI: Someone has blessed us. A job, a roof, a school. Soon I'll be able to send money home... (looking at Amrita) ... and put away a little bit for your dowry.
SCHOOL GIRL: Rickshaw wallah!
RAM: (calling)
MAX: (he gets it)
JOAN: (a beat)
MANOOJ: Are you the American doctor?    Are you coming here to help us.
MAX: No, I'm the visiting American soccer star, El Max.
MANOOJ: Do you go to the cinema in America, El Max?
MAX: When I was your age -- two movies, plus cartoons every Saturday.
MAX: There you go, little guy.    Ut -- what's this?
SHAMBU: Daddy, there is the doctor from America. He saw two movies every Saturday. What's in your fist? Open, Daddy!
MAX: (to Joan)
MAX: Tell her again to breathe in short little bursts now.
MAX: All right!   Now, tell her to push.
MAX: Again.   Yes!   Again.   It's coming.
MAX: We've got it, we've got it.     Yeah!
JOAN (O.S.): Jesus, my brother, you who I am trying to believe are the light and salvation of the puking world
JOAN (O.S.): Please see that we are living in madness and darkness here...
JOAN (O.S.): ... and we need help. Om, Jesus, om and amen.
BETSY (V.O.): Yes, yes, yes, that's right, yes! I turned in your ticket!
BETSY: (to herself)
JOAN: Well, well, well, I do so love to be surprised.
MAX: Okay, for starters, pick me out someone with something easy I can heal, make me look good. (to Aloka) Aloka, you're my assistant, let's go.
JOAN: Max, knock it off, give us a bit of hush. (as he does) What happened?
MAX: I changed my mind.
JOAN: And I'm a bloody bathing beauty.
MAX: Okay, so I got left.
JOAN: Smart girl... So how long am I stuck with you?
MAX: Two weeks -- or until Mom sends me a ticket.
MAX: No way. Six weeks -- and that's my best offer.
JOAN: Two months -- and that's my final offer.
MAX: (a beat) Done.
JOAN: Jesus and Mary. The Lone Ranger rides again.
JOAN: Watch your --
MAX: Thanks -- got it.
ASHOKA: Not working? How will my father eat this evening?
HASARI: I was just...
ASHOKA: You have a daughter?
HASARI: Yes, Babu.
MARWARI (O.S.): Rickshaw wallah!
ASHOKA: Keep working. Give this to Sister Joan and your friend the doctor when you go home.
MAX: (to Aloka)
HASARI: (giving her the note)
MAX: (to Ashoka)
ASHOKA: Who gave you your rickshaw?
HASARI: The Godfather.
ASHOKA: Who provides the food you eat?
HASARI: The Godfather.
ASHOKA: Remember:   Loyalty.
ASHOKA: You taking that to the clinic? (as she nods) You like it there? (as she nods) And they love your smile, don't they?
LEPER WOMAN: It is too beautiful to believe.
MAX: (to Poomina) (to Joan)
MAX: (a litany)
ASHOKA: Well.    What have you got to say?
HASARI: I told them that your father provides us with a great deal and that --
ASHOKA: From this minute, you   are off the list! You will leave    your rickshaw here... where it will   be reserved for a man who deserves   our trust.
HASARI: Please, Babu, this is as if the ground has opened up. I have to speak to Mr. Ghatak!
ASHOKA: My father's ill! You are speaking to me!
JOAN: (a beat)
MAX: (raises his hand)
HASARI: Take more.
HASARI: Take more.
JOAN: It's not like  he's royalty or anything, so  I'm not persuaded we have to wait  for the plane to actually take  off.
ALOKA: No.   We should go.
MAX: What were those three choices again?
ANOUAR: (Max nods)
MAX: (to Hasari)
HASARI: (a beat)
MAX: (whispering)
MAX: They'll admit him, but we have to pay for the blood. I gave him all I had. He wants more. Do you have anything?
ALOKA: Sister Joan gave me this.
MAX: We haven't got any more!
MAX: If this child dies while you stand here, I'll kill you.
MAX: Now, I need an X-ray room and I need an O.R. nurse.
ATTENDANT: Not possible. You can't give care, you're an American. You must be an Indian doctor.
RAM: (then fearful)
GHATAK: (to Hasari now)
CHOMOTKAR: The only thing that matters is the bundle of rupees we take to the munshi each month to feed and to answer the daily needs of our children!
RASSOUL: Listn to me! Listen now! Listen to me! (when the pullers quiet) Friends! I ask you to vote for an unlimited strike. Inkalabad zindabad! Long live the revolution! Rickshaw Workers Union zindabad!
ASHOKA: That's what I thought. All right, get to work! Customers are waiting!
HASARI: Friends! The Godfather at least is a caring man! This one, though, the son --
HASARI: Friends -- don't! If we stand --
HASARI: The life of a rickshaw puller is not one a man would choose if he had a choice. Our feet blister and burn up from the boiling asphalt, our noses burn from the fumes of countless motor cars and buses, our backs curve permanently from the loads we carry hour after hour, day after day. But I am proud to be one of the human horses who carry my countryman from place to place and I am thankful for the opportunity to make a living. But I will not keep silent anymore and I will not be cheated and threatened anymore. Life is hard enough. No more.
HASARI: Is there someone you care about?
HASARI: Then I must speak to his father and I must complete your dowry.
HASARI: You will make people sigh at how beautiful you are. And I shall drop tears of joy.
RAM: At my wedding I became so frightened, my father gave me things to drink to calm me down. I went out to piss and fell asleep under the village tree. When I woke I thought it was the tree I'd married. I still love that tree.
HASARI: How can I help?
ANOUAR: I think Aloka would have a gentler touch than you, Max Daddah. Maybe she should perform this surgery on her own.
MAX: Last time you told me you were more than two women could manage.
ANOUAR: Yes, but given a choice between one and none, I will accept the one.
MAX: Okay, you ought to be good for another few days. Send in the next patient.
MR. GHOSH: (considering this)
MEETA: Anouar!
ANOUAR: Max Daddah!
MAX: We're here!   We're here!
OTHERS: It's the doctor. Save Doctor Big Brother!
MAX: (a distant laugh)
MAX: (a beat)
HASARI: (to the kids)
ASHOKA: (to the Goonda)
MAX: Why don't you go on home.   I'll stay with him.
HASARI: I was dreaming the sound of rickshaw bells, and now I hear them.
HASARI: Are they here for me?
HASARI: A city so big. When we arrived, we didn't have a place to live, a friend.
RAM: ( he shows Max)
MAX: I thought that's why we've been writing all these letters.
RAM: Yes, of course, I love her from here, yes; but, what if I go home and find I don't love her from there.
SHAMBU: Daddy needs gold, right?
SHAMBU: Do you think this is pretend gold or real?
