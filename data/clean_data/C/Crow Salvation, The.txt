ERIN: Why are there so many?
RANDALL: Just hold on to me.
ERIN: It's because they're doing this on his birthday.
GONZALEZ: Mr. Randall. Sir. Do you think this execution will bring you a sense of closure?
RANDALL: Leave us alone!
GONZALEZ: A difficult time for everyone Interesting fact. It will take about twenty-one cents of electricity to execute Alex Corvis tonight on this, his twenty-first
WALSH: He didn't order that.
MERCER: We found the man with the scar.
WALSH: ( intense whisper ) Get it out of here.
OLD WOMAN: Yes, I've come to a lot of these over the years, but this one has many unique aspects. Youth of the condemned. That's unusual. Fifty three stab wounds. Kind of a record.
GONZALEZ'S VOICE: And Corvis still maintaining his Oh, they all say that.
OLD WOMAN: Oh, they all say that.
TOMMY: I don't fault him saying I lied on the stand. Facing the chair, you do what you gotta do. But I saw those two fighting that night.
WALSH: You ok?
ALEX: What's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. And I'll be seeing her again soon. Only what will I say? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? That he's down here laughing?
WALSH: Tell her. we'll get him.
ALEX: We won't.
WALSH: Someday he'll surface and I'll get him for both of you. I promise. I'll find the guy with the scar.
ERLICH: This mystery man with the scar. .the zigzag, whatever.
GONZALEZ: Some people here seem to.
DUTTON: People here are protesting the execution of a kid just turning twenty-one. A kid who had a tough life. No parents, no dough. Always had to fight for everything. It's a tragedy, it really is. But I don't see a single sign telling me Alex Corvis is innocent.
MERCER: I was facing the hot seat, I'd want my attorney banging down the door of the Supreme Court, not playing board games. But maybe that's just me.
WALSH: Your move.
MERCER: No. It's time.
ALEX: I don't want you to watch. I don't want to give them the pleasure.
MERCER: Ok. C'mon now.
MINISTER: The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
WARDEN: Alexander Frederick Corvis. Do you have any last words?
ALEX: I loved Lauren. I still do. I'm
MERCER: Cruel, who's to say, but it sure was unusual.
GUARD ONE: Look at this. Goddamn helmet melted That, my friend, is a deterrent.
MERCER: That, my friend, is a deterrent.
MERCER: CRUNCH. The sound of something breaking as the SHOVE Alex into the cubby hole.
GUARD ONE: Why do they even autopsy these guys? Cause of death is pretty fucking obvious.
RANDALL: ( to Erin ) I'll meet you atthe car, honey.
DUTTON: We all wish this had ended better.
ALEX: ( to his own reflection ) What happened?
ALEX: Follow the leader.
RADIO GUARD: We've got unauthorized movement in "B five."
MERCER: ( into radio ) Mercer. I'm on it.
MERCER: ( into radio ) Found our intruder. It's got a beak and a death wish.
MERCER: ( still into radio ) Get me some backup. We got one loose on the row. ( through the bars to Alex ) Now who the fuck are you?
ALEX: It's my birthday.
MERCER: Yeah, well. here's a present for
ALEX: Go ahead. Make a wish.
MERCER: Alex wheels around as Guard One squeezes the trigger. CROWVISION The Taser Darts speed toward Camera. RESUME Alex shunts himself to the side and the TASER DARTS impale themselves in Mercer's thighs. He drops fibrillating. A CHEER goes up from the men in their cells, who become progressively rowdier as the guards BOLT and Alex follows, strength in his stride, nightstick in hand. Pieces of FLAMING TOILETPAPER flung now from the cells of AT THE FAR ENTRANCE the two Guards scramble to get the door closed behind them before Alex catches up. They'd make it except Alex hurls. THE NIGHTSTICK flying end over end like a throwing knife, catching the trailing guard in the back of the head, dropping him in the door, propping it open. ALEX enters the cage entrance to Deathrow, sharing the space with the Guard still standing.
ALEX: ( pats pockets, then )
RADIO GUARD: Unauthorized movement in B five, B six, C three, four, five.
ALEX: I hear the pitter patter of little
BULLHORN VOICE: Do not proceed. Back slowly away from the fence.
ALEX: Alex turns, sees. A HALF DOZEN GUARDS emerge from the stairwell to the top of the roof, level weapons at Alex.
MERCER: Then who was the fucking Houdini?
ALEX: Happy birthday.
ALEX: ( checking out desk ) Police? Evidence? ( then, to Crow ) Look. I like what we've got going here. But I can think of lots better to do with it than fighting crime. Know what I mean?
LAUREN: I'm your Angel. Come here.
ALEX: No! I didn't.!
TOMMY: His knife. Corvis.
ALEX'S VOICE: You lie!
ALEX: You lie, you lie, you lie. Thomas Leonard.
DUTTON: What the hell was that?
ALEX: I thought I'd be with you now.
LAUREN: ( "Chinese" pseudo dub ) Your Shaolin style is no match for my kung fu.
ALEX: I'm not dead. And I'm not alive. And I'm remembering. And it hurts.
LAUREN: Your. flying crane style is no match for my. drunken tiger kick.
ALEX: I can't be alive. Not without you.
LAUREN: Your. mad monkey. love . is no match for.
RESUME: I want to be with you forever.
ALEX: I want to be with you forever.
LAUREN: Only forever?
ALEX: What happened to us?
ERIN: Nathan looks over. Sees she's holding the Locket.
RANDALL: Honey. I just can't.
ERIN: Stay in the car. I'll only take a Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
RANDALL: Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
ERIN: It's not that. Really. It's just. now that he's gone, I think it's
ALEX: It's ok. I'm not going to hurt Don't come near me!
ERIN: Don't come near me!
ALEX: I was a friend of your sister's.
ERIN: I know her friends.
ALEX: That locket you're holding. You have one just like it.
ERIN: Yeah, no kidding.
ALEX: Your father gave them to both of And he's right over there by the What did you do to your face?
ERIN: And he's right over there by the What did you do to your face?
ALEX: Someone else did it.
ERIN: You're a friend of the guy who killed her, aren't you? You almost sound like him.
ALEX: He didn't kill her.
ERIN: How do you know?
ALEX: I know everything about your sister. I'll prove it to you.
ERIN: ( loud now ) Stay away from me! Dad! Dad!
RANDALL: Watch out!
ERIN: Watch out!
RANDALL: What were you yelling about?
ERIN: This guy said he was a friend of Lauren's. He had like paint all over his face.
RANDALL: Are you ok?
ERIN: What's that supposed to mean? He was right here. He was!
HOOKER: Yo, Tommy. Red light special. Even you can afford it.
TOMMY: ( sees Alex, then ) Sssshhh. She's resting.
ALEX: Sssshhh. She's resting.
TOMMY: Where the fuck did you come from?
ALEX: Big bang, primordial ooze, divine hand of a benevolent creator? All possibilities. Although recent events have given me doubts about the benevolent creator.
TOMMY: I don't know you, man.
ALEX: Capital case nine nine dash C one one five. Alex Corvis. Exhibit A.
TOMMY: Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl.
ALEX: You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
TOMMY: What's your damage, man? Corvis hacked up that girl like a
ALEX: One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car.
TOMMY: There's no scar. Corvis made it Wrong. Answer.
ALEX: Wrong. Answer.
TOMMY: Who are you?
TOMMY'S WIFE: TOMMY'S WIFE enters from the bedroom, SCREAMING. Heavy eye makeup, looking like she just woke up. OS, a TODDLER CRIES as she throws herself on Alex and they spill back inside.
TOMMY: Honey. Take the baby. Get out of here now!
TOMMY'S WIFE: He's all I got. Tommy and the baby. Don't take him. The baby needs a
ALEX: Your baby is crying. Go.
TOMMY: They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."
ALEX: ( repeats, insistent ) What did they give you?
TOMMY: A job. Construction. Twelve an Write down their names. All of
ALEX: Write down their names. All of
TOMMY: You already got 'em. Right here. These cops said the needed an eyewitness, or Corvis would walk.
TRACY: Oh no.
DUTTON: Let's hope not. License and registration please.
TRACY: She's. sick. Actually she never had Mai Tais But you, you've had them.
DUTTON: But you, you've had them.
TRACY: Not tonight. Honest.
DUTTON: If you had a license, I bet I'd have seen it by now. How old are you? Fifteen?
TRACY: Look, I'll tell you the truth. Jannie drove us and was supposed to drive us back, she has a license, but I mean. look at her. Get up, get up.!
DUTTON: Why don't you get out.
TRACY: You want me to walk a straight I want you. to bend over.
DUTTON: I want you. to bend over.
TRACY: Look, can I just call a cab?
DUTTON: What did I say?
ALEX: ( mimicking Dutton ) I want you. to bend over. Officer
DUTTON: Where'd you come from? Out of the car. Now!
ALEX: Question. These hands?
DUTTON: You're dead, ditch weed.
TRACY: Omigod, omigod.
ALEX: You're up.
DUTTON: That was a fucking hollow point!
ALEX: I guess it's true. Guns don't kill
DUTTON: Keep that thing away from me.
ALEX: This is not just some "thing." It's A C zero zero five.
DUTTON: You're the skel broke into the evidence room.
ALEX: A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
DUTTON: There's no scar, you freak. The Corvis kid made it up.
ALEX: He was innocent. You framed him. You. And Erlich. And Larkin. And Toomey. What do you think, Officer Dutton? An eye for an eye?
DUTTON: Bitch killed herself when she shot a cop in the leg. If she' just acted like a girl nothing would have happened. So you're right, spooky. Happy?
ALEX: I'm working on it.
MADDEN: A moment of panic as the guys bent over the machines freeze. Raise their hands, slowly turn. Then lower their hands.
ERLICH: You fuck. Don't do that.
MADDEN: How's the month end?
ERLICH: Oh yes. Never been better.
MADDEN: Where's Dutton?
ERLICH: Probably parked near some high school with a hardon. Fuck never Anyone at all curious why?
MADDEN: Anyone at all curious why?
TOOMEY: No one saw anything, Mad.
MADDEN: You know why Dutton's not here? Rigor mortis! He's dead.
TOOMEY: Since when?
MADDEN: Since last night. As usual, you're right on top of things.
LARKIN: It was supposed to end when Corvis died. Remember? The kid no one would miss?
ERLICH: Don't look at me, asshole.
LARKIN: Hey, I didn't kill anybody.
ERLICH: Back off. I mean it.
MADDEN: Shut up! Erlich and Larkin settle Crime scene's a goddamn clusterfuck. Every reporter in town's trying to get a look at Dutton's body. I suggest we get a line on this before someone else does.
LARKIN: Who'd give a shit about Corvis at this point? Kid didn't have a friend in the world even when he was alive.
ERLICH: I can think of one.
GONZALEZ: . rumors multiply as officials refuse to confirm or deny reports of multiple, multiple stab wounds.
ERIN: Dad! Come in here!
RANDALL: What is it?
ERIN: The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car.
GONZALEZ: They're moving him now, body covered. It would appear that thirty seven year old Phillip Dutton is dead in the line of duty.
COP: Out of here! Now!
GONZALEZ: Shocking even for these mean streets, the word "Daisy" apparently cut into his head by the perpetrator, still at large. A name. Perhaps a message.
RANDALL: What? What is it?
ERIN: Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.
RANDALL: Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message.
ERIN: That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about It still doesn't mean.
RANDALL: It still doesn't mean.
ERIN: He said he'd prove it.
WALSH: I don't know about any knife. I'm trying to forget that case.
ERLICH: Well someone isn't. They killed It wasn't me.
WALSH: It wasn't me.
ERLICH: No shit. You couldn't get close to him. But I'm betting you know who did. Who's into Corvis? Huh?
ERLICH'S VOICE: You're the only one gave a flying fuck about him when he was alive.
WALSH'S VOICE: Lauren Randall did.
ERLICH'S VOICE: Hey. Bitches are crazy. Richer they are, crazier they get.
WALSH: Maybe if you hadn't fried an innocent kid.
ERLICH: Who is it?
WALSH: How about the real killer. You think of that?
ERLICH: If you're covering for someone, that's jail time. I got my eye on
WALSH: Walsh moves cautiously to the curtains, draws them back. Nothing. He leans out the window.
ERLICH: No, no.
ALEX: The Germans really know how to make a car, don't they?
ALEX: ( re: Lauren knife ) I heard you were looking for this.
ERLICH: You're the guy killed Dutton.
ALEX: I want you to think of me as the guy who killed you.
ERLICH: Stop the car.
ALEX: The WOUND closes. Knife still in Alex's hand.
ERLICH: Fuck. Me.
ALEX: What happened to your leg there Officer? Hunting accident?
ALEX: In Saudi Arabia they cut off the hands of petty thieves. What price for a life? Two lives?
ERLICH: Not my arm! What you fucking want?
ALEX: I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want. to know why.
ERLICH: Why? Why's anything happen? It's all money, man. Money. The girl just got in the way.
ALEX: The scar. Which of you has it?
ERLICH: Alex poises the knife for another descent.
ERLICH: Are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to die.
ALEX: How can you die if you're already You're him. Corvis.
ERLICH: You're him. Corvis.
ALEX: I was talking about you.
ELVIS: My dream. comes true. right
ERIN: Daisy. How did you know?
ALEX: I told you, I knew your sister.
ERIN: You killed that cop Dutton.
ALEX: And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn. I know who you are. That's why you paint your face. To I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
ERIN: I know who you are. That's why you paint your face. To I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
ALEX: I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
ERIN: You killed Lauren! You killed her!
ALEX: Not me. Dirty cops killed her. Dutton, Erlich.
ERIN: My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.
ALEX: No. Listen to me. Lauren found out something they didn't want her to
ERIN: No! Why are you haunting me?
ALEX: Because you need to understand. And you need. to be careful.
SERGEANT#2: Listen up! Yo! We got a cop killer out there.
LARKIN: He knows. I saw him. Fucking zombie Calm down.
MADDEN: Calm down.
LARKIN: You calm down.
TOOMEY: You didn't testify. You're not on the list.

SECRETARY: Glad I'm not you.
MADDEN: Right back at ya.
CAPTAIN: Sit down.
MADDEN: Yeah, we do.
CAPTAIN: Shut up.
MADDEN: I know.

CAPTAIN: Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment Guy dressed for Halloween?
MADDEN: Guy dressed for Halloween?
CAPTAIN: Good for you. You do know something.
SECRETARY: You're the only one who makes it go away.
CAPTAIN: You're the only one who makes it go away.
RANDALL: ( trying to be casual ) What are you doing there?
ERIN: I think I dropped an earring.
RANDALL: Looks like you have them both on.
ERIN: Alex Corvis didn't kill Lauren. Cops did. Didn't they?
RANDALL: It's not what you think.
ERIN: You killed her!
RANDALL: Stay away from me! Stay away!
ERIN: Stay away from me! Stay away!
RANDALL: Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
RANDALL: They killed her because she found About you.
ERIN: About you.
RANDALL: About them. You've got to leave it
ERIN: Don't call me that! Don't call me
RANDALL: I would never hurt you or Lauren. Never. Believe me.
ERIN: I don't believe you.
RANDALL: Please. Come inside.
ERIN: I'm never going back in that house again. Get away.
TOMMY'S WIFE: Please! Leave him alone!
TOMMY: I'm not making this up. He had a crow with him.
LARKIN: Caw, caw, that's what you're telling He said I lied at his trial. It's Alex Corvis.
TOMMY: He said I lied at his trial. It's Alex Corvis.
LARKIN: So we're talking. a ghost. With a pet bird.
TOMMY: Corvis. It's.
LARKIN: ( cutting him off ) Take your time. Think before you speak. Cause at this point I got to hear something besides the crap you're been spewing.
TOMMY: He said the whole trial was a setup. That I caused an innocent kid to die. Is that true?
TOMMY'S WIFE: No, please.
WALSH: He looks out the window a second. Then scans the room again.
ALEX: Dream on.
WALSH: My God. It's really you under there.
ALEX: Two down. Two to go.
WALSH: "Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
ALEX: The cops from my trial. They killed Lauren. The whole thing was fixed.
WALSH: I'm thinking. that explains a
ALEX: Lauren's father's involved. He bought the cops fancy cars, I don't know what else. It's a company called D-E-L-T. I think Lauren found out.
WALSH: What do they do that they had to kill her?
ALEX: I was hoping you'd find out.
WALSH: Yeah. I sure will.
ALEX: This is where it happened. Right over here.
ERIN: Yeah, I know.
ALEX: Are you ok?
ERIN: When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right? But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on . is that I sent them here. I told them she came here sometimes. With her dirtball boyfriend. That's exactly what I said.
ALEX: . is that I sent them here. I told them she came here sometimes. With her dirtball boyfriend. That's exactly what I said.
ERIN: . is that I sent them here. I told them she came here sometimes. With her dirtball boyfriend. That's exactly what I said.
ALEX: Erin. It's not your fault.
ERIN: ( losing it now ) It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
ALEX: No. You don't.
ERIN: Yes I do, I really do. There were four of them.
ALEX: There were four of them.
ERIN: He's holding his hands over her eyes, transferring IMAGES that shake them both. ALEX/ERIN'S INTERNAL POV Jolting FLASHES. A Plainwrap stops where the Mercedes is now. A hand slams the car into Park. Doors open. Four men get out, seen dimly, but they're Dutton, Erlich, Larkin, Toomey. Erlich reaches back in to drag Lauren out of the back seat, her hands cuffed in front of her. Dutton flips up her skirt with his nightstick.
ALEX'S VOICE: Four large men. And still. She grabbed one of their guns. Got off a shot, then ran, ran for her
ERIN: I don't want to know.
ALEX: She ran. Them breathing down her . all the way from the road to this tree. This tree. Here's where it happened.
ALEX'S VOICE: . all the way from the road to this tree. This tree. Here's where it happened.
ALEX: This tree. Here's where it happened.
ERIN: I don't want to see!
ALEX'S VOICE: She turned and faced them and went down kicking and punching and fighting them, fighting death as they stabbed her and stabbed her. Fifty three times.
ALEX: She fought for her life because life is worth living.
CAPTAIN: Why wasn't the incident reported?
MERCER: Nothing to report. All inmates were present and accounted for.
CAPTAIN: So you pretended nothing happened.
MERCER: Hey, Corvis fried. I don't really see how it could be him.
CAPTAIN: No. I wouldn't expect you to.
MERCER: Be forewarned. Nature takes its Bon appetit.
CAPTAIN: You lost him! Now lay off the fucking doors!
MADDEN: They botched the execution.
CAPTAIN: Could say that.
MADDEN: Christ. It was Corvis. Tommy Leonard was right.
SECRETARY: Maybe you were a little harsh on
MADDEN: Fucking crow.
CAPTAIN: Sign of the dead come back to life.
MADDEN: How about sign of a big black bird?
CAPTAIN: The dead can return, given sufficient motivation. And Corvis has that.
SECRETARY: This guy David Jenkins came back as a ghost because my uncle owed him four dollars. Followed him everywhere. Ruined his life.
MADDEN: Time out. You really saying he's back from beyond?
CAPTAIN: He's looking for something. Won't stop until he finds it. Sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want.
SECRETARY: The man.
ALEX: . with the scar.
ALEX: . took everything I ever cared about. Left me with nothing.
ERIN: So you're going to kill him?
ALEX: Have to find him first.
ERIN: My father.
ALEX: All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
ERIN: I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is.
ALEX: It's what Lauren would do.
ERIN: I want to forget. Forget what I know. Forget myself. Forget
CAPTAIN: You know it doesn't work this way.
NATHAN: I'm out of this.
CAPTAIN: Partnerships don't end like that. Friendships don't.
NATHAN: Our friendship ended when Lauren
CAPTAIN: Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening You mean Alex.
RANDALL: You mean Alex.
CAPTAIN: I mean Lauren.
RANDALL: You killed my daughter.
CAPTAIN: An accident, Nathan.
RANDALL: ( exploding now ) She was eighteen years old! There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times! Where's the fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is
CAPTAIN: I watched her grow up. Just like you. I know how her mind worked. She kept snooping around because she was worried about you. What you'd gotten yourself into. So stop blaming me. And blame yourself.
RANDALL: ( beat, quietly ) I do. Every day.
CAPTAIN: Erin knows, doesn't she?
ERIN: Dad?! You home?
WALSH: It's like a bowl of spaghetti. D-E- L-T is owned by Westwind Builders, Nathan Randall's company. But DELT in turn owns a dozen other corporations. A big mess to wade through, so I checked out Tommy
ALEX: Leonard, Dutton, Erlich. They don't matter. I want the King.
WALSH: We're getting there. Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "The Hole."
ALEX: The strip joint?
WALSH: I believe they call it a connoisseur's club. Owned by DELT.
ERIN: Walsh opens the door and Erin enters, wild and blood smeared, remnants of the Crow mask around her eyes.
ALEX: It's ok, it's ok.
ERIN: It's not. I can't take it.
ALEX: Erin. Who?
ERIN: I don't know. I found him lying

ALEX: Toomey and Larkin. They're expecting
BOUNCER: I need to see some I.D., pal. Circus in town?
ALEX: I don't think you want to do that. Lot of innocent people here. A lot of people, anyway.
WALSH: We'll be safe in my car. Nobody will recognize it. Let's move yours in back, no, down the block. Hope it's nothing fancy. There's a chop shop around the corner.
ERIN: You followed me here.
CAPTAIN: No. Erin, I put out a bulletin on your car because. there's bad news. And I thought you should hear it from me.
ERIN: How did he kill himself?
CAPTAIN: How did he kill himself?
ERIN: No. I mean. how did he kill himself How do you figure he killed himselfwith a gun, rightwhen it wasn't anywhere near where you found him?
WALSH: Erin. Don't.
ERIN: Back the fuck off! Now! He left this. Names, addresses, a note to you. These people he was involved with killed Lauren. He couldn't bear it anymore.
CAPTAIN: He left this. Names, addresses, a note to you. These people he was involved with killed Lauren. He couldn't bear it anymore.
WALSH: My God. He's right, it's all here.
ERIN: The note. Show it to me.
CAPTAIN: It's right there, under that paper. Here. Look.
MADDEN: You need help?
CAPTAIN: Hurry. We don't have much time.
ALEX: How old are you?
ALEX: Lauren? You were here?
LARKIN: ( after the fact ) Don't move.
ALEX: They look up and. BAM! Alex DROPS LARKIN with a shot to the forehead. BAM! He MISSES TOOMEY as bullets from below EXPLODE all around him. Alex scampers across framing as. The BARE BULBS burst, all but one, plunging us back in to near darkness as Alex drops to the ground near Larkin's fallen body. Jacks up the sleeve. No scar. Alex spots Toomey, rolls out as. THREE COPS pump rounds into Alex. BAM! Alex takes the middle Cop out, a TOONEY-LIKE GUY who falls onto Toomey, behind him. ALEX turns, forced to defend himself as FULL AUTO FIRE breaks open, the other flank, more advancing cops. While. TOOMEY crawls out from under the fallen copy, then backs out the door on hands and knees while. A FINAL EXPLOSIVE FUSILLADE leaves only Alex standing. As the echoes dissolve. Alex Alex moves to where Toomey was, bends down to check the body. THE NAMEPLATE - "TOOMEY" But the pin isn't fastened The badge askew. RESUME - ALEX rolls the body over, finds another nameplate underneath. "Hauser." Heads off in search INT - "THE HOLE" - INTERNET PORN FACILITY - NIGHT Toomey is clearing the "No Admittance" curtain when.

ALEX: I'm losing you.
LAUREN: Your zigzag love scar is no match Did you have to do that?
GIRL: Did you have to do that?
BOYFRIEND: How about "thank you."
GIRL: He's bleeding.
ALEX: I don't bleed.
BOYFRIEND: And delirious. Better steer clear.
ALEX'S POV: The Guy wraps his arm protectively around the girl, walks her off. Running into a COP at the next intersection. They POINT at. ALEX takes off, ducking into an alley. Confused. CAMERA CREEPS BACKWARD as he gathers his thoughts.
ALEX: SMASH. His arm PUNCHES through the glass, turn the knob. Alex enters, arm bleeding badly. He yanks a large piece of glass from his flesh. Painful. Alex registers that the rules have changed. He finds a necktie of Walsh's, uses it to bind the wound, staunch the flow. He scans the room again looking for. Something. But everything seems ok. He passes. The Chess Box, the picture of Lauren and Alex gone. Just a piece of TAPE left, sticking to the top of the open lid.
CAPTAIN: I hate that picture.
ALEX: Where are they?
CAPTAIN: Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion?
ALEX: Where are they? Last chance.
CAPTAIN: Or what? You'll bleed all over my
ALEX: I'm looking for my friends.
CAPTAIN: See, I heard you were looking for some guy with a scar. How's that going? You find him? Yes? No?
ALEX: You sent them. I had no choice.
CAPTAIN: Bullshit. You're a killer, that's all you are. A clown with a bird and a rising death toll. You think the world did you wrong?! You did the world wrong.

ERIN'S VOICE: When I think of Lauren fighting and dying, it tears me apart, but it also reassures me. That Lauren and Alex were meant for each other.
ERIN: I love Alex. As my sister always hoped I would. And I love Lauren. And I know, because of this, that love does not die. I'm alive. Thinking of them. Hoping that, sometimes, they're thinking of me.
