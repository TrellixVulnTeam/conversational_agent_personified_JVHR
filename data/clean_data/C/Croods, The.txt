THE CROODS: Written by
GRUG: Raaaaar grooooOOOOoooowwwll ERF ERF As suddenly as he began, Grug stops. Panting, he waits for the echoes of his outburst to fade. Grug TURNS to the cave entrance, he prepares to BELLOW a signal, but before any sound escapes his lips A CAVE GIRL, EEP, bursts from the cave.
EEP: We've been in that cave forever.
GRUG: Three days is not forever.
EEP: It is with this family.
GRUG: Eep would you come down here? You're being so dramatic. A LITTLE GIRL, SANDY, charges out next. Her display is more terrier-like.
UGGA: As soon as I get Sandy, I'll go back in, and you can give the signal.
GRUG: No, I mean, you're already out now.
GRUG: Never mind, Thunk. Just, come out.
THUNK: ( not so fast ) Uhh, but if you don't give the signal, how do I know you're my dad?
GRUG: The signal isn't so you know it's me, it's so you know I wasn't eaten by an Then why is the signal an animal noise? I mean, doesn't that just confuse things? Grug sighs.
THUNK: Then why is the signal an animal noise? I mean, doesn't that just confuse things? Grug sighs.
GRUG: Sigh. Hoo hooooo! Hoo hooooo! Thunk comes out growling, and barrels into Grug. Thunk picks up a boulder and throws it. It ricochets off the cliff wall and careens into Grug. Grug gets plowed over by the boulder.
UGGA: Mom, we're ready to leave.
GRAN: Still alive! Grug's face drops.
GRUG: It's still early.
GRAN: And you're still fat.
GRUG: Breakfast formation! The Croods form up in a flying wedge, with Grug in the I want to see some real caveman action out there. We do this fast. We do this loud, we do this as a family and never not be afraid. Go!
THUNK: YAY, BREAKFAST!!!! COMPRESSED TIME - The Croods RUN out of Crood canyon, across the wide expanses of desert.
YAY, BREAKFAST!!!!: COMPRESSED TIME - The Croods RUN out of Crood canyon, across the wide expanses of desert.
THUNK: ( HUFFING )
GRUG: Who's up? Eep's hand SHOOTS up. Thunk is less than enthusiastic.
EEP: Gran FACE-PLANTS, her head buried in the sand. Only her tail is showing.
GRUG: Tails. Thunk's in.
UGGA: Get um Mom! Do it for the Croods! Gran's cane HOOKS the gerbils in the middle of their tail and WHIPS them up and over her shoulder.
ON GRAN: DRIBBLING the egg down-range with her cane like a hockey player. LIYOTES POP UP from behind hoodoos. They SWARM in behind her. The Liyotes TRIP Gran. They steal the egg, and HIT THE GAS. They are INCREDIBLY FAST.
GRAN: Old lady down! Eep, avenge me.
ON EEP: Crouched in the shade of a scrubby bush, like a runner on the blocks - she has the Liyotes in her sights. Eep
EEP: A bunch of Jackrobats see Eep and swarm around her. She loses her footing and throws the egg to Grug.
GRUG: Heads Up! Grug catches the egg and runs by the entrance of a small cave. Thunk following close behind accidentally trips over the tail of a sleeping Bear Owl knocking Grug to the ground and fumbling the egg once again. Thunk catches the egg just as the Girelephant bears down on him from behind and lifts him onto one of its tusks. The family members meet up as they begin their long run back to the cave. An entire swarm of animals chase the Croods as they head back to their cave. The Bear Owl is awakened and goes after everyone on the Grug protecting his family from the BearOwl tosses each family member onto the Girelephant's back. Grug dodges the BearOwl's attack and uses him as a launching pad to get himself safely on the Girelephant. Thunk is happy to see Dad is safe.

THUNK: Oh hey Dad, can we eat now?
GRUG: Just wait till we get home. Eep put on the brakes. The entrance to Crood canyon appears on the horizon.
THUNK: Alright! Good one, dad!
GRUG: Here you go, Thunk. Drink up. Grug tosses the egg to Thunk, Thunk fumbles it and it cracks open.
THUNK: Sorry, dad.
UGGA: Looks like fast food tonight! The family passes the leaky egg around quickly, each Crood gets a taste. Thunk is the last Crood to get a mouthful, he hands it over to Grug the egg is empty.
GRUG: That's alright. I ate last week. A SHADOW TOUCHES Grug's feet. He looks up - the sun is setting behind the canyon wall. He HOLDS UP his hand to gauge how much daylight is left.
GRAN: Two knuckle warning.
UGGA: Come on Croods. Go, go, go.
GRUG: Come on, come on. Darkness brings death! We know this. The Croods RUN INSIDE THE CAVE. Ugga picks up a heavy stick off the floor.
UGGA: The moon is full. Bath night. ( grumbling, Gran tries to run
AWAY ): You too, Mom.
GRAN: Run for your life. Ugga pulls Gran back.
UGGA: Mom, you've got ants. ( hanging Sandy up ) Whack! Like she's cleaning a rug, Ugga SMACKS Sandy hard with the stick. Dust and bugs fly off of her.
GRAN: ( UPSET )
GRUG: Is she still out there?
UGGA: You know she hates the cave, Grug. ON EEP clinging to the side of the sheer rock face above Crood cave. She RAISES HER HAND to `catch' a few more moments of sun.
EEP: Please come back tomorrow. ON GRUG getting his `bath.'
GRUG: How can she not like the cave? It's so It is a little, dark, Grug.
UGGA: It is a little, dark, Grug.
GRUG: It's not that dark. Grug is finished with his bath.
EEP: Okay, okay!
GRUG: Come on. Behind Grug, the Bear Owl appears up the canyon. It SPOTS Grug and the open cave and RACES to attack. Grug sees the BearOwl in full attack mode.
SIGH: CUT TO:
GRUG: That was too close!
EEP: I was watching. I was fine.
GRUG: What were you doing up there, Eep?
EEP: I don't know.
GRUG: What were you looking for?
EEP: Well then why did you go up there?
GRUG: Well then why did you go up there?
EEP: ( ANNOYED )
GRUG: Why don't you know? Stop looking for things. Fear keeps us alive Eep. Never not be afraid. Eep climbs up on a ledge and curls up in the corner where a tiny spot of light seeps in.
EEP: ( TO HERSELF )
GRUG: Hmmm? What was that?
EEP: ( a little louder ) I mean, why are we here? What are we doing this for?
CROODS: No one said survival was fun.
GROAN: No one said survival was fun.
GRUG: No one said survival was fun.
EEP: Nothing is fun.
GRUG: Hmm? Would you come down here. Eep? No answer. Grug CLIMBS up. Ugga PULLS Grug back down.
UGGA: Grug. Off.
GRUG: Grug climbs back up.
UGGA: I just don't see why she needs her own ledge. That's all. That's what this is She's working through some things and needs her own space.
GRUG: I just don't see why she needs her own ledge. That's all. That's what this is She's working through some things and needs her own space.
UGGA: She's working through some things and needs her own space.
GRUG: What things? How long is this going to take? Really? I mean she already doesn't listen to me. A pebble hits Grug in the head. It came from Eep's See? She's listening.
UGGA: See? She's listening.
GRUG: If she wants to survive, she has to follow our rules.
UGGA: How about a story? Eep loves those. Grug brightens.
GRUG: ( BRIGHTENING )
THUNK: Oh yeah, tell us a story. The Croods minus Eep gather in a semi-circle on the ground. Grug retrieves Sandy and her Krispy Bear from the bone-crib.
GRUG: Ok. Can I borrow that? Thank you. Eep! Your old favorite?
EEP: I haven't played with that thing in Tonight we'll hear the story of Krispy Grug sits and waits a beat for Eep to join, but she stays As Grug talks, he gestures at a rough sketch on the wall of the cave.
GRUG: Tonight we'll hear the story of Krispy Grug sits and waits a beat for Eep to join, but she stays As Grug talks, he gestures at a rough sketch on the wall of the cave.
UGGA: Ugga covers Sandy's ears.
GRUG: Yes. And one day, while she was in a tree, the curious little bear wanted to climb to the top.
THUNK: And no sooner than she climbed to the top, she saw something new and died. Grug SWATS the painting.
GRUG: And no sooner than she climbed to the top, she saw something new and died. Grug SWATS the painting.
THUNK: Just like that?
GRUG: Yes! Her last moments of terror still frozen on her face. Grug holds out Krispy Bear. The family is terrified.
GRAN: Oh, same ending as everyday.
THUNK: ( FREAKED OUT )
GRUG: Good man, Thunk. Pan across the walls to reveal they are covered with stories all seemingly with the same ending.
UGGA: Alright, everyone sharpen your teeth and let's pile up. All their worst fears confirmed, the Croods snuggle into one big heap, warm and comfy. Grug casts a glance to Eep's ledge. She doesn't budge.
CREATURE: Nuh! Nuh! The Creature defensively raises its arms, hands in front of its face.
GUY: Hands? Eep GASPS, shocked to see HUMAN HANDS attached to this monstrosity. The Creature slowly puts his hands to the sides of his grotesque head, and RAISES its mask. It's a boy. he's BEAUTIFUL! This is GUY.
EEP: Eep LEAPS BACK a few paces, DROPPING the rock on Guy's Eep moves swiftly to silence him. She POUNCES on him and TWISTS his head sideways. Guy is SUFFOCATING. He feels around for a stick and BASHES Eep in the side of the

EEP: Eep moves swiftly to silence him. She POUNCES on him and TWISTS his head sideways. Guy is SUFFOCATING. He feels around for a stick and BASHES Eep in the side of the
GUY: ( GASPING )
EEP: .You talk.
GUY: I'm a person, like you. Eep TOSSES the boulder aside and LIFTS Guy with one hand.
EEP: Eep DROPS Guy on his head.
GUY: OW! Wow. Eep jams her foot over Guy's mouth.
EEP: Quiet! I'm not supposed to be out here. Guy BITES her foot.
OW!: She KICKS Guy in the stomach. He ROLLS sideways. Guy is getting the worst of this encounter. Eep kicks Guy off- frame. We HEAR the fight continuing.
GRUG: ( TO UGGA )
UGGA: What? Grug!
GRUG: Stay in the cave! Grug stands outside the entrance to the cave. Peering into utter darkness. He steels himself. and then releases his hand from the "door."
GUY: ( in pain, defeated ) Wow. You're really strong. The flame DWINDLES. Guy MOVES toward it. Eep BLOCKS No! It's mine. No, no. I caught it!
EEP: No! It's mine. No, no. I caught it!
GUY: It's dying. I can fix it! Eep doesn't want to.
EEP: It does what you tell it?
GUY: Well, yeah, sort of.
EEP: The sun?
GUY: No, no. Fire.
EEP: ( to the flame ) Hi, fire.
GUY: ( LAUGHING )
EEP: But you said it was dying.
GUY: Uh sorry,
EEP: It comes from where you come from?
GUY: No. I make it. Eep BALLS her fist, GRABBING Guy tightly by the hair.
EEP: Make some for me.
GUY: Ow. Okay, it doesn't come out of me.
EEP: Make. MAKE! MAKE IT! Eep SQUEEZES Guy like a tube of toothpaste.
GUY: You do this a lot. Something CRACKS. Eep DROPS Guy - he's broken.
EEP: Are you dead? Can I have your fire if you're dead? Belt RUBS two flat rocks together and places them on Guy's chest like defibrillator paddles. Guy BOLTS Hey, those are cold!
GUY: Hey, those are cold!
BELT: You think? Listening shells, activate. Belt AND Guy use shells to LISTEN to the ground.
GUY: You think? Listening shells, activate. Belt AND Guy use shells to LISTEN to the ground.
EEP: I don't even know you.
GUY: ( pained, rushed ) Ow. I'm Guy.
EEP: And this is Belt. Cook, conversationalist, navigator, also keeps my pants up.
GUY: And this is Belt. Cook, conversationalist, navigator, also keeps my pants up.
BELT: Hhiiyaa! Yaaa!
EEP: What are "pants up?"
GUY: Who are you?
EEP: ( cutting her off ) Let me clarify, Eep. The world is I'm calling it.
GUY: ( cutting her off ) Let me clarify, Eep. The world is I'm calling it.
EEP: I'm calling it.
GUY: I'm calling it.
BELT: Da da daaaaa.
EEP: How do you know? Guy and Belt both do gestures to accompany the Da da daaaa. It seems very important to them.
GUY: I've seen it. It's coming this way. First, the Earth is going to shake. Then it breaks open. Everything falls in. Fire. Lava. I don't mean to sound too dramatic, but Aaaaaaaugh. Believe me, everything we're standing on, all this right here, will be gone. Again with the gestures. It's a little weird to Eep.
EEP: I can't. Guy hands the shell to Eep. And Eep is mesmerized. Guy pulls his hog-mask back down.
GUY: Okay. Here. If you survive, call me. Eep test-blows the shell. It makes a sound, she giggles. When she looks up to thank Guy, he is GONE.
EEP: Thank you. Hello? Hey! Eep BUMPS directly into Grug.
GRUG: Are you hurt? What took you?
EEP: Nothing. I left on my own.
GRUG: You. youuuuuuu. ww-what!?
EEP: Dad, let me explain. A low GROWL interrupts them. ON THE BEAR OWL Sniffing around. It passes over a log. CRANE DOWN to reveal Grug hanging under the log by one hand, Eep dangling in the other.
GRUG: You're grounded.
GRUG: Things are tense between the two. At the KEYHOLE, they are met by the rest of the Croods.
UGGA: Grug! What happened!?
EEP: Grug! What happened!?
UGGA: Grug! What happened!?
GRUG: You know what, I am so mad right now, that I can't talk to her.
UGGA: You'll never believe it. I found something new.
EEP: You'll never believe it. I found something new.
CROODS: The Croods all SNATCH up stones. They form a defensive Eep is trapped in the middle of the defensive formation. She SQUEEZES out.
GRUG: New's a big problem! Eep is trapped in the middle of the defensive formation. She SQUEEZES out.
EEP: Wait. Wait!
UGGA: Eep. Stay inside the family kill circle.
EEP: It wasn't bad.
GRUG: New is always bad.
EEP: No. He was nice.
GRUG: What!? Excuse me? He?
EEP: Oh. Well, I thought he was a warthog, but then he turned into a boy.
GRAN: Strange. Usually it's the reverse. Grug RAISES an eyebrow.
THUNK: Eep's got a boy hog! Eep's got a boy Eep ELBOWS Thunk in the back of his head.
EEP: There was a boy. Watch, okay. I'm gonna call him. Eep pulls out the SHELL. She BLOWS into the shell - the sound ALARMS the Croods. They SMACK the shell from Eep's hand and SMASH it with their rocks. Eep is incredulous. The dust clears - the panting Croods are satisfied the object is gone.
GRUG: It was dangerous.
EEP: ( VERY ANGRY )
THUNK: Owww! My sniffer!
GRUG: Okay Eep, that's it. We're going back to the cave and you're going to stay in there until you're older than. her!
EEP: What!? You can't keep me inside forever! Eep throws a tantrum of epic proportion. She SLAMS a rock on the ground. It SHATTERS to dust. CREAK! A strange GROAN is heard from under the ground. Then a small amount of sand falls from up above. A crack starts to splinter under their feet.
GRUG: Get to the cave! GO! The Croods RACE through the CANYON NARROWS, fighting their way through falling boulders and shifting ground, heading towards the safety of their cave. The Croods see the cave entrance. The canyon walls above their home start to crack. Grug sees that the falling rock will crush the cave.
UGGA: Yes. Grug, the cave, it's gone.
GRUG: Grug searches the rubble for any sign that the cave might still be there. He finds one handprint, split in two. He carefully fits them back together. Emotional, he lowers his head. As Eep steps forward, a shaft of light filtering through the dusty veil from the wreckage crosses her face As the dust descends, Eep sees A NEW WORLD beyond.
EEP: You really need to see this. The dumbfounded Croods stare in awe at the beautiful The Croods look out at the new world.
GRUG: No. No one is going anywhere. Grug pulls Eep back from the precipice.
UGGA: Just go! Go! Go! The Croods run towards the precipice with the Bear Owl closing in. They reach the edge. The Bear Owl dives. The Croods LEAP. They hang for a moment and begin tumbling down a steep jungle hill.
GRUG: Just go! Go! Go! The Croods run towards the precipice with the Bear Owl closing in. They reach the edge. The Bear Owl dives. The Croods LEAP. They hang for a moment and begin tumbling down a steep jungle hill.
GRUG: One, two, three, four, five BEAT. Grug smiles. Gran lands in a heap behind him.
GRAN: ( winces in pain ) Oh. Where are we?
GRUG: I don't know, I'm not sure. Down. In a lower place. One thing's for sure, we can't go back the way we came.
ON SANDY: Sniff sniff sniff ( hushed, urgent ) Sandy? What is it? Sandy LUNGES at something almost disappearing into a Grug BARELY catches Sandy by her leg. Grug PULLS her back like a dog on a leash.
SANDY: Sniff sniff sniff ( hushed, urgent ) Sandy? What is it? Sandy LUNGES at something almost disappearing into a Grug BARELY catches Sandy by her leg. Grug PULLS her back like a dog on a leash.
UGGA: ( hushed, urgent ) Sandy? What is it? Sandy LUNGES at something almost disappearing into a Grug BARELY catches Sandy by her leg. Grug PULLS her back like a dog on a leash.
GRUG: No, no! Come back, Sandy! Sandy has a MOUSEPHANT in her mouth. Grug knocks it from Sandy's mouth. A gaggle of mousephants run out from the bush and scurry away.
THUNK: ( RAMBLING )
GRUG: Eep and Grug LOOK UP.
THUNK: I'll take care of this. Grug launches into his Threat Display -
GRUG: I'll take care of this. Grug launches into his Threat Display -
THUNK: Alright dad, go get `em! Oh, oh, now you got em Now they're really hitting you. Dad I got it, just stop running into their fists. Gran joins in and punches Grug in the nose.
GRAN: Hah, I'm loving this.
UGGA: Grug, when you're done, we should get Wide shot: Grug is being bounced back and forth like a pinball from one punch Monkey to the next. The Punch Monkeys are whooping and hollering - this is great fun! The Punch Monkeys let go of Grug and begin running away for no apparent reason. Grug staggers backwards into the family.
GRUG: That's right! You can't get past this!
CHUNKY: A colorful 'bush' rears up - it's not a bush, it's a MACAWNIVORE! The Croods react, terrified Grug throws a rock at it. The Macawnivore catches the rock and SPRINGS! -
ROOOAR!: A colorful 'bush' rears up - it's not a bush, it's a MACAWNIVORE! The Croods react, terrified Grug throws a rock at it. The Macawnivore catches the rock and SPRINGS! -
CROODS: Climb! Climb! Climb! Grug pushes and forces the Croods up a huge tree then as it steps away it is actually a giant animal. GRUG'S POV: A cave!
GASPS: Climb! Climb! Climb! Grug pushes and forces the Croods up a huge tree then as it steps away it is actually a giant animal. GRUG'S POV: A cave!
GRUG: Climb! Climb! Climb! Grug pushes and forces the Croods up a huge tree then as it steps away it is actually a giant animal. GRUG'S POV: A cave!
THUNK: Hey look! This cave has a tongue. SEQ. 1250 - GUY TO THE RESCUE The Land Whale stands up and then SPITS the Croods out through its blow hole. The Croods land in a heap.
GRUG: Okay, that's one, two, three, four, five. six.
GRAN: And seven. if we're counting Chunky the Death Cat.
CHUNKY: The Macawnivore appears from behind some nearby grass. It looks at the Croods with delight. Suddenly, the shadow of the setting sky passes over the Macawnivore. It freaks out and retreats into the forest.
THUNK: Hah! It's scared of the dark. wait. we're scared of the dark. And for good reason, because as the SHADOW from the setting sun falls across the Croods. Suddenly, thousands of PIRANHA OWLS BURST from the grasses around the Croods and form a huge undulating cloud above them. It's a beautiful sight. The cloud of Piranha Owls then SETTLE on a massive LAND
GRUG: Kill circle! The Croods form their defensive circle, brandishing Eep spies a SKULL lying in the sand. She SPRINTS for it.
GUY: ( Sigh. ) Grug pushes Eep aside and shows Guy his threat display.
EEP: ( Sigh. ) Grug pushes Eep aside and shows Guy his threat display.
GRUG: SMASH CUT TO: SEQ. 1275 - FIRE GOOD, FIRE BAD Suddenly, Guy and Eep are circled by the Croods. They are in defensive ape-like positions. Each doing their threat display.
CROODS: ERF ERF
ERF ERF: Guy stands in front of Eep defensively.
GUY: Cavemen! Stand back! They're practically animals. See their bony, sloping foreheads?
EEP: Cavemen! Stand back! They're practically animals. See their bony, sloping foreheads?
GUY: Cavemen! Stand back! They're practically animals. See their bony, sloping foreheads?
EEP: Oh. yeah!
GUY: The huge primitive teeth?
EEP: Er. yeah.
GUY: The excessive body hair? Oh, that one's got a tail.
EEP: Uhhh. yeah. Guy PULLS his knife.
GUY: Close your eyes. I'm going to have to take their lives.
EEP: ( slapping the knife away ) No. It won't help.
GUY: Eep nods toward Thunk.
THUNK: Ah, the sun is in his hands!
EEP: No. No. It's "fire."
UGGA: Where did it come from?
EEP: ( PROUDLY )
GRUG: Make some for me!
EEP: It doesn't come out of him.
GRUG: Make. Make it. POP! Guy's ribs are cracked for the second time.
GUY: You know, you're a lot like your Guy falls in a heap.
EEP: Great, now he's broken.
GRUG: Whoa! Stay back. We don't know what it As Grug moves around the circle, picking up sitting Croods and placing them a safe distance from the fire, he talks to them like a kindergarten teacher:
THUNK: Dad, Sandy's hurting fire. Grug reaches down and scoops up Sandy. ( NOTE: From this point, Grug will hold onto Sandy, no matter how much she struggles, kicks and bites. )
GRUG: Sandy! No! Fire is not a play thing!
UGGA: Aww, what a cute little guy.
GRUG: Hey, stay back. The Croods snatch at the embers as they dance in the air around them.
THUNK: It likes me! ( after a beat ) Hey! IT'S BITING ME!! Thunk takes off running like a maniac. The flame explodes into embers, which starts more fires in the grass around him. Grug looks at the growing fires with utter confusion.
GRUG: Thunk! Uh, try hiding from it in the tall dry grass! Thunk sprints through the grass, arms flailing, as a ring of fire blazes up.
THUNK: ( pleading with fire ) Stop please, please. I'm only nine. Gran cackles at her grandson's misfortune, but then she realizes her WALKING STICK IS ON FIRE. Angrily, Gran starts to slam the burning end of the stick on the ground, trying to put it out. But she only ends up making more small fires.
UGGA: Ooh, more fire babies. While Gran tries desperately to save her cane, Ugga starts throwing sticks on the small fires, which begin to grow in size.
EEP: So, your Dad, he's trying to kill me.
GUY: So, your Dad, he's trying to kill me.
EEP: Yeah. But I won't let him.
THUNK: I don't like you anymore!
SANDY: Gran, who is still trying to put out her stick, is batting it into every tree and bush she can hit.
GRAN: Get out! Out! Ugga carries a REDWOOD above her head and then tosses it onto the small fire.
UGGA: Eat up, babies! WHOOSH! Ugga ignites a massive bonfire. The Croods appear like a bunch of violent, lunatic CLOSE ON GRAN Gran is pounding her walking stick on the ground. PULL BACK TO REVEAL - she is standing on the edge of a giant corn field that is slowly catching on fire.
GRAN: Die! Die! POOF! The fire on her cane has finally gone out.
EEP: They're not so scary once you get to know Eep and Guy are HIT by the speeding corn.
GUY: Who are you people?
UGGA: Oh, I'm sorry. We're the Croooooods! And you are?
GUY: Uh, Guy.
CROODS: ( WAVING )
THUNK: Wow! Looks like magic. And smells like Popcorn kernels RAIN DOWN upon the Croods. They are
GRUG: Don't eat it, it's new.
CROODS: Still alive!
BELT: Guy BURROWS out the side of the popcorn pile like a prisoner escaping Alcatraz.
GUY: gasping for air ( checks to see if he's been
SPOTTED ): Hey, where's Guy? Guy RUNS for the mountain. Eep POUNCES on Guy like a Going somewhere?
EEP: Hey, where's Guy? Guy RUNS for the mountain. Eep POUNCES on Guy like a Going somewhere?
GUY: Going somewhere?
EEP: Going somewhere?
GUY: The mountain? High ground? End of the world, remember?
EEP: That already happened. It destroyed our Noooo. That was just the beginning of the end. The end of the end is still coming.
GUY: ( STRUGGLING )
GRUG: ( as if to a dog ) Eep. Drop it. Eep SETS him down. Guy BOLTS but discovers Eep hasn't let go of his hand. Guy is YANKED backwards like he's been tied to a piling.
EEP: We can't let him go! What if we don't find a cave before sunset? What if it takes a few days? What if the birds come We need his fire, dummy! WHOOSH! Grug grabs Guy and throws him in a log.
GRAN: We need his fire, dummy! WHOOSH! Grug grabs Guy and throws him in a log.
GRUG: Fine. You're staying with us till we find a cave. Grug hoists Guy in the log onto his shoulder.
GUY: What? No I'm not. Don't make me part of this. Stay here if you want, but let me go. I've got a dream, a mission, a reason to live.
EEP: ( BRIGHTLY )
GUY: ( THINKING FAST )
GRUG: ( BARELY LOOKS )
EEP: Dad really has his heart set on a cave.
GUY: Uh, there, are, caves on that mountain.
EEP: Have you been there?
GUY: It's a mountain. Mountains are safe. Mountains have caves. And water. And Mom? Did you hear that? I can get my own stick!
THUNK: Mom? Did you hear that? I can get my own stick!
GUY: Yes. Sticks. Caves and sticks. Crazy sticks. Let's go. On cue, a RUMBLE. This gets Grug's attention. Grug STOPS. The Croods wait to see what's going to happen next. A Mammoth FALLS out of sight, SWALLOWED by the Da da daaaaa.
BELT: Da da daaaaa.
THUNK: Ugh. That thing is weird. Belt antagonizes Sandy by sticking his tongue out at her. Sandy goes at Belt again.
EEP: No no, it's okay Sandy. That's just a Grug takes a step back. Turns.
GRUG: I've made a decision. We're going to, that mountain! Don't ask me why. It's just a hunch. It just feels right.
UGGA: I don't know Grug. We've never really walked that far.
THUNK: I don't think my feet can do that.
GRAN: I'll never live long enough to get there.
GRUG: ( LIGHTING UP )
THUNK: Aaaaaaaaugh. Get her off. Get off.
UGGA: If you're not ready to challenge her, then don't look her in the eye. We follow Sandy as she moves past Gran.
GRAN: Could you keep your big giant arms on your side of the trail! Sandy moves past Ugga, Eep and Guy who is still stuck in the log and being carried by Grug.
UGGA: No more touching. No more touching.
EEP: Isn't this fun? We're taking our first trip together. Thunk accidentally bumps into Eep.
GRUG: Do you want me to turn this family around? Do you?! Because I will turn this family around so fast! The camera slowly pulls out from the family in chaos as they walk across the burned out landscape.
THUNK: Dad, I gotta go!
GRUG: Come on, you can hold it.
THUNK: I don't think so.
THUNK MOANS: THUNK ( CONT'D ) ( NEAR TEARS )
GRUG: ( RELINQUISHING )
THUNK: Ow! Something bit me!
GRAN: ( LOUD )
UGGA: Maybe we should have stopped for water.
EEP: Dad, can I take a turn carrying him?
GRUG: How about now?
EEP: How about now?
GRUG: ( even louder ) NOW?!?!
EEP: ( even louder ) NOW?!?!
GRUG: ( even louder ) NOW?!?!
EEP: ( even louder ) NOW?!?!
NOW?!?!: ( even louder ) NOW?!?!
GRUG: ( even louder ) NOW?!?!
NO!: ( even louder ) NOW?!?!
EEP: ( even louder ) NOW?!?!
GRUG: I can do this all day long. No, no, no, and still no.
GRAN: I'm not dying on an empty stomach.
UGGA: Grug, we're all pretty tired.
THUNK: I'm pretty dizzy, so I'm just going to lay down for a minute.
GRUG: We'll eat when we get there.
GRAN: It's taking too long! I'm grabbing a Gran jumps up and tries to grab Belt. Belt pulls a bone knife and defends himself.
GUY: No. No. No. Don't do that. He will cut you. That's not food, he's a pet. My What's a pet?
GRAN: What's a pet?
GUY: An animal that you don't eat.
GRAN: We call those children.
GRUG: No man should have a pet. It's weird, and wrong. It's ( spies giant bird ) .It's food!
GUY: No, no please!
GRUG: Not that. That.
GRUG: Food fixes everything. Grug grabs Thunk.
THUNK: Eep shows her hunting face.
GRUG: Not you! You're still grounded!
THUNK: My feet hurt.
ON GUY: Leaning against a rock next to Gran, Sandy, Eep and Ugga. Guy notices Eep is agitated. She STARES in the direction the men went.
GUY: You look tense.
EEP: I'm not tense.
GRAN: Angry girl wants to be doing what they're Ow! I wasn't ready!
THUNK: Ow! I wasn't ready!
THUNK: Why are you doing this?
GUY: What are they doing?
UGGA: Get it off! You stay away from me.
THUNK: Get it off! You stay away from me.
GUY: No seriously, what are they doing? The Turkeyfish squashes Grug into the ground. Then continues chasing Thunk.
THUNK: ( to Turkey Fish ) You've got a ton of eggs. Just make another egg! Thunk FLIES INTO FRAME and SPLATS against the rock. The Turkey Fish climbs to the top of a nearby rock and dives Now you're just rubbing it in.
GRUG: There! Who's hungry for scorpion? The Croods PULL at the legs. They TWIST and SNAP OFF like lobster legs.
GUY: What happened to the egg and the bird?
THUNK: ( STILL PUNCHY )
GRAN: Not enough. Not enough. I need more. I need more! Gran looks hungrily at Guy.
GUY: ( CONCERNED )
UGGA: You're too skinny. If she was gonna eat anyone it would be
THUNK: THUNK ( CONT'D )
AAAAAAAAAUUGHHHHHHHH!: THUNK ( CONT'D )
UGGA: Sandy gets up from the table.
THUNK: Someone get a stick! Get her off! Guy looks on, horrified.
GRUG: Hold her still. Use a rock. Ugga would you just hit her legs. Guy LEAVES. Eep chases him and pins him down.
EEP: Why are you rolling away?
GUY: Owww! I just want something to eat.
EEP: You have bug for dinner. Plenty of bug!
GUY: Please. I'll let you help me hunt.
EEP: Ahhh! They're all over me. Tell my EXT. GRASSLANDS - AFTERNOON Guy lays a snare in the low grass. He WALKS to the base of a rotund, spikey tree, unwinding more rope as he goes. He TIES the rope around the base of the tree. Then he hands the loose end to Eep. Belt stretches his arms WIDE. Guy STOPS jumping and points up to the top of the Eep takes the cue. She LEAPS up and grabs the leaning top of the tree. Her weight gently BENDS the tree top down to the ground.
THUNK: Ahhh! They're all over me. Tell my EXT. GRASSLANDS - AFTERNOON Guy lays a snare in the low grass. He WALKS to the base of a rotund, spikey tree, unwinding more rope as he goes.

She LEAPS up and grabs the leaning top of the tree. Her weight gently BENDS the tree top down to the ground.
GUY: Guy carefully SETS the trigger.
EEP: What do you call this?
GUY: A trap.
EEP: What does it do? Guy makes sound effects to get his point across as he describes the trap.
GUY: ( explains with sounds ) soft whistle Raargh, Thump thump thump, thubububububub soft whistle poom! How long have you been alone? Belt opens his arms wide showing Guy has been alone a long, long time.
EEP: How long have you been alone? Belt opens his arms wide showing Guy has been alone a long, long time.
GUY: How's your acting? ON THE TURKEY FISH getting ready to eat the TRIP-GERBILS. The Turkey LIFTS the creature to his mouth to DEVOUR it, but he's INTERRUPTED by a WHISTLING sound. He TURNS to see the silly little puppet dancing about. The Turkey Fish DROPS his meal and cautiously APPROACHES the puppet. ON GUY AND EEP working the puppet. Eep is having the time of her life.
EEP: Just move your arm. no, your other arm. Oh, that one's mine. In their struggle to UNTANGLE themselves, Eep and Guy inadvertently insult the Turkey Fish. It CHARGES. Eep and Guy don't notice. The Turkey Fish MISSES the snare, LEAPS the rock and SNATCHES the fake bird off of Guy's head, THRASHING it.
GUY: Yeah, I noticed. Eep BOLDLY STANDS in front of the bird. The Turkey Fish grabs Guy and tosses him high across the open field. He goes flying through the air, screaming. ON GRUG - hearing the commotion. Guy lands back in the Where's Eep? Eep is in full parkour as she runs from the Turkeyfish.
GRUG: Where's Eep? Eep is in full parkour as she runs from the Turkeyfish.
GUY: She's awesome. Grug STEPS FORWARD. He's going to SPRING the trap.
GRUG: Dad, no! She LEAPS the snare, PUSHING Grug DOWN. The Turkey Fish HITS the trigger. The snare TRIPS. The bird BITES at the cavemen, but comes up short. The Turkey Fish WHOOSHES BACKWARDS into the air. He FLIES a couple hundred feet up. . and CRASHES down in a cloud of feathers.
EEP: Dad, no! She LEAPS the snare, PUSHING Grug DOWN. The Turkey Fish HITS the trigger. The snare TRIPS. The bird BITES at the cavemen, but comes up short. The Turkey Fish WHOOSHES BACKWARDS into the air. He FLIES a couple hundred feet up. . and CRASHES down in a cloud of feathers.
THUNK: It's an avalanche of flavor. THE CROODS are eating like wild animals. They practically MAUL each other for scraps. HOWLS and SNARLING fill the night air. Guy is amazed and shocked at how the Croods are wolfing it down.
GUY: ( TO BELT )
EEP: What are "left-overs?"
GUY: ( CONFUSED )
EEP: We never have that much food. Grug is struck by Eep's words. Ugga sees Grug is hurt. Guy and Belt are struck by this as well.
UGGA: Grug, how about a story?
GRUG: That's a good idea. How about a story Yeah a story, tell us a story! Croods gather around Grug.
THUNK: Yeah a story, tell us a story! Croods gather around Grug.
GRUG: Once upon a time there was a little tiger who lived in a cave with her family. There were a lot of rules, but the big, simple one was to never leave the cave at night. And the door was so heavy, you'd think it would be easy to remember.
THUNK: So easy to remember!
GRUG: I know! But, while everyone was asleep, she went out anyway.
CROODS: Yes! And no sooner than she did, her cave was destroyed and everyone had to go on this long, sucky walk, with some weirdo they met, and died! The end.
GRUG: Yes! And no sooner than she did, her cave was destroyed and everyone had to go on this long, sucky walk, with some weirdo they met, and died! The end.
GUY: Whoa! I did not see that coming. Twist ending. My stories never end like that.
THUNK: Yes! Two stories in one night! The Croods LEAVE Grug and GATHER around Guy. Guy is uncharacteristically dumbstruck.
GUY: Okay. But it won't be as good as Grug's. Um, once upon a time, there was a beautiful tiger. She lived in a cave with the rest of her family. Her father and mother told her, "You may go anywhere you want but never go near the cliff, for you could fall."
GRUG: And die. Good story. Thinking the story is over, the Croods begin to get up. As Guy begins talking again they settle back down.
GUY: But when no one was looking, she would go near the cliff, for the closer she came to the edge, the more she could hear, the more she could see, the more she could feel. Finally, she stood at the very edge, and she saw a light. She leaned out to touch it, and slipped.
GRUG: And she fell.
GUY: And she flew.
CROODS: Where did she fly?
GASP: Where did she fly?
THUNK: Where did she fly?
GUY: A place with more suns in the sky than you can count.
EEP: A place with more suns in the sky than you can count.
GUY: A place with more suns in the sky than you can count.
THUNK: It would be so bright.
GUY: A place not like today, or yesterday, a place where things are better.
GRUG: Tomorrow isn't a place, you can't see it!
GUY: Oh yes, yes it is. I've seen it. That's where I'm going. Grug studies Guy. Is he crazy? Eep though is entranced. Eep and Guy lock eyes. There is something growing between them. Grug and Belt see it too. Grug is not thrilled.
GRUG: Well, WE are going to shut our eyes and sleep. And when we wake up we're going to find the place that has everything we A cave. Grug stuffs Guy neatly back inside the log. Grug CURLS UP by the fire with the LOG TUCKED UNDER HIS ARM far away from Eep.
EEP: A cave. Grug stuffs Guy neatly back inside the log. Grug CURLS UP by the fire with the LOG TUCKED UNDER HIS ARM far away from Eep.
GRUG: A cave. Grug stuffs Guy neatly back inside the log. Grug CURLS UP by the fire with the LOG TUCKED UNDER HIS ARM far away from Eep.
GRUG: snoring, tossing and turning
GUY: SMASH CUT TO: SEQ. 1600 - CROODS GET SHOES EXT. CORAL FIELDS - MORNING The Croods trudge behind Grug as he cautiously makes his way to the mountain. Grug SNIFFS, and TESTS the ground - he moves like a man in a mine field. Meaning SLOWLY.
THE LOG: Eep walks alongside Guy, who is still being carried by Grug in the log.
GUY: That was too close. It almost caught us.
GRUG: I was watching. We were fine.
GUY: We've got to move faster. Do you people have any other speed aside from "wander?" I'll take a shamble at this point.
EEP: Hey, do you have a minute? How did the tiger fly?
GUY: I only share when I'm outside the log. I'm funny that way.
EEP: ( WINKING )
GRUG: He's loose! Grug goes to retrieve Guy, and STEPS on something sharp.
THUNK: You mean these rocks? Ahh owww! Do not step on these rocks! Thunk steps on the coral - it CRUNCHES under his feet.
GRAN: Step aside, girls! Gran steps out, and then SCREAMS.
GRUG: Hello? Nobody's listening! No one is listening. You cannot walk on those! Guy stands on the coral without flinching.
GRAN: Well, there goes our chance for survival.
THUNK: And our log! Grug must make the choice to go after Guy.
GRUG: Okay. Arraugh! Grug cringes and bellows with every step. Guy still locked inside the log, hops away as fast as he can. Grug leaps out and grabs the log only to loosen it as Guy jumps to a coral patch below.
GUY: Ow, ow, ow. Guy now free runs and hides behind a giant shell. He looks back at the Croods as they try in vain to cross the field and feels pity for Eep.
THUNK: Ow! Jumping doesn't help, I mean, just briefly, but it doesn't get better! Ow! Do not walk on your hands, the hands do not help at all. Guy looks back at the stranded Croods. Then he looks again to the tall mountain. Belt sees that Guy is having a hard time leaving the Croods. He needs to make a choice. Belt makes it for him.
BELT: Eeccoomme on! Belt walks Guy back to the Croods
GUY: I can help you, but we're going to have to make a few changes around here. The log ride is over. Drop the log. Grug grudgingly DROPS the log.
GRUG: Okay, smart, Guy. now what? Guy SMILES.
THUNK: Ahhhh! Good fish. Eep is covering her eyes.
GUY: Okay. Now you can look. Eep peers down at her new boots.
EEP: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh! I love them! Where are my feet!?
GUY: They're still there!
EEP: Oh, okay. Eep slips, and falls into Guy's arms.
GUY: Whoa. You're really
EEP: Really? Thank you! Grug walks over as the two fall to the ground.
GRUG: Hey, wait. Whoa. Whoa. WHOA!!
GUY: ( SWEATING )
GRAN: These shoes are great! Where do you get these ideas?
GUY: Ah ha. On cue, Belt produces a piece of chalk. Guy stands Thunk against a wall. Guy stands next to him. Belt OUTLINES them. Guy excitedly gestures to the I'm calling it, a brain. I'm pretty sure it's where ideas come from.
THUNK: Dad. I don't have a brain.
GRUG: We've gotten along just fine without brains till now. Cavemen don't need brains. We have these. Heeya! Haha! ( balls his mighty fists ) That's what I'm talking about! Ideas are for weaklings. Grug punches at the air in front of Guy making him wince.
THUNK: Good fish. Don't eat my feet.
EEP: So. How'd the tiger fly?
GUY: He jumped on the sun and rode it to Grug doesn't like seeing his daughter so close to Guy.
GRUG: No, no, no! The family moves across, Grug is the last to follow. Grug spies Chunky the Death Cat below him. Grug WHACKS Chunky in the face with a stilt. Chunky ponders the strange sticks Grug is perched on, then WHACKS a chunk out of them. Grug DROPS down by a yard or so. Panicking, Grug RACES across the chasm, losing stilt height with every SWIPE of Chunky's paw. Grug doesn't make it across - SNARLING and BITING sounds emanate from the canyon.
THUNK: Hi dad! Bye dad!
GUY: You've seen rain before. right?
EEP: We don't get out much. Guy opens an Umbrella to cover himself from the rain. Belt pulls Eep under the umbrella to be close to Guy.
BELT: Belt makes an Origami boat. He and Sandy sail across the rain puddles. Grug seeing Guy and Eep snuggling under the umbrella, grabs the umbrella away from Guy. Grug gets hit by The rest of the Croods open their umbrellas to take cover as they enjoy the RAIN.
GRUG: ( FRUSTRATED )
EEP: Oh dad, you say that about everything. Eep goes to jump in the water. Guy STOPS her.
GUY: Oh really? Okay. Guy CANNONBALLS. Then SURFACES. Eep tentatively HOPS in. Guy STEADIES her. Then shows her how to move her arms in a swimming motion. Guy SUPPORTS Eep by holding one hand under her tummy. She begins to SWIM. Gran and Ugga SMILE mischievously - a positive vibe is The Croods ALL JUMP at once. Grug is left alone. Belt uses Grug's arm as a diving platform. Gran, Sandy and Belt are doing synchronized swimming. Then Grug sees Eep and Guy SURFACE - Eep is on Guy's shoulders! This is too much for Grug!
EEP: Oh really? Okay. Guy CANNONBALLS. Then SURFACES. Eep tentatively HOPS in. Guy STEADIES her. Then shows her how to move her arms in a swimming motion. Guy SUPPORTS Eep by holding one hand under her tummy. She begins to SWIM. Gran and Ugga SMILE mischievously - a positive vibe is The Croods ALL JUMP at once. Grug is left alone. Belt uses Grug's arm as a diving platform. Gran, Sandy and Belt are doing synchronized swimming. Then Grug sees Eep and Guy SURFACE - Eep is on Guy's shoulders! This is too much for Grug!
GRUG: Augh! No no no! Not cool. Not cool. Not cool. Grug DIVES IN to put a stop to any potential shenanigans. Grug's huge tidal wave SWAMPS Guy and Eep. Grug SINKS to the bottom. ON GRUG laying on the bottom. His family SWIMS above him on the tails of Fishcats, confident and free and buoyant. A lone bubble escapes Grug's nose, like oil oozing from a sunken wreck. He's feeling mighty extraneous. Grug sees the Macawnivore swimming towards him. Grug swims for his life. Ends in a big splash.
GUY: So the bear says, "Your cave?" I've been dumping my bones here since last week.
GRAN: Last week, haha. That's a funny story!
GUY: It's not a story! It's a joke.
GRAN: What's a joke?
GUY: You know, just making something up. to make you laugh.
GRAN: Hah, I don't get it.
GUY: Here you go, one for you, and this ones for you.
THUNK: Grug is annoyed by everyone blowing their shells.
GRUG: Okay. Okay. That's enough. I don't see why the kids need their own shells.
GUY: So if anyone gets in trouble, we can call the others.
GRUG: Wait you're saying we should split up?
GUY: We can try more paths at once. It's the fastest way through.
GRUG: Croods stick together.
GUY: They can handle it.
EEP: We can do it, dad.
GRUG: No no no no no. It's my job to keep you safe. I'm still in charge and we are not splitting up. ( seeing Eep and Guy together ) Except for you two. And that's final. Grug SITS down like a silverback gorilla. Just then, A HUGE RUMBLE. The EARTH STARTS TO SHAKE VIOLENTLY. The Croods and Guy are KNOCKED DOWN into the Maze each `falling' into a separate entrance. They disappear into the rift like a penny dropped down a As Grug and Guy slide passed each other. Frustrated Grug, tries to punch Guy.
GUY: Oh, hello.
GRUG: ( VERY FRIGHTENED )
UGGA: ( trying to calm him ) We're okay, Grug.
THUNK: Dad? I'm freaking out a little bit. Just tell me what to do. Just what do I do right now?
GRUG: Stay where you are. I'll find you.
GUY: No. Too slow. Everybody, keep moving forward and we'll get out.
THUNK: ( ALMOST HYPERVENTILATING )
GRUG: ( ALMOST HYPERVENTILATING )
ON THUNK: Looking very frightened.
THUNK: It's gonna be okay. I'm gonna pass out. Thunk PICKS UP his shell, and tentatively makes his way, alone, into his branch of the maze. ON EEP ( OR GUY? ) in another part of the maze. She puts her hand on the giant wall to her LEFT. PULL BACK and see that they are actually in parallel `channels' but with the huge wall between them. ON Gran and Ugga - encountering carnivorous flowers. ON Thunk - encountering a croco-pup. ON Eep - finding a flower dropped on her path. ON Grug - reaching a fork. Ugga and Gran don flowery camouflage. Thunk THROWS his shell at the Crocopup, MISSES. To his surprise the Crocopup returns the shell. Thunk plays fetch with this portly beast, which shows him the way through the maze.
EEP: You dropped these. Guy slips and falls onto a huge lilypad. He smiles up at They share a moment before Eep shyly vanishes again. Grug finds himself back at the entrance of the maze. He grumbles and enters a different tunnel.
GUY: Come with me. Eep and Guy turn to each other, just as Thunk emerges and tosses a rock for the Croco-Pup to fetch.
THUNK: Here boy, catch! A shell note signals Ugga, Gran and Sandy's arrival. There is an obvious change in the ladies.
EEP: ( APPROVING )
BELT: ( APPROVING )
UGGA: Grug lets out another blow on his horn.
THUNK: Good boy. Whose my good boy? You need a name, you want a name? I'm going to call you - Douglas. Look at him. Can you do tricks? Roll over. Come on Douglas, roll over. Douglas ROLLS OVER, right OFF the tree.
GRAN: I was in love once. He was a hunter, I was a gatherer. It was quite a scandal. We fed each other berries. We danced.
BELT: Ha ha ha ha.
GRUG: ( PANIC )
UGGA: Grug, they're okay. Guy's with them.
GRUG: Oh, oh, `Guy'. `Guy' is with them. Well thank you for bringing me that interesting Guy update! A BEAT - Ugga regards her husband
UGGA: Oh, okay. I'm gonna go up and why don't you join us when you stop being a big Ugga climbs up the tree to be with the rest of the Grug isn't thrilled with Ugga's shot at him. He picks up two rocks and tries to make fire.
GRUG: Sleep pile? How about a story, huh? Grug listens intently. All he hears is laughter.
TREE TOP: Thunk, Sandy Belt and Gran are sitting around a torch, listening to one of Gran's stories.
GRAN: And then Torg said "Know it? I drew it!"
THUNK: That makes no sense. Ugga arrives and sits next to Guy. She takes in the I know it was hard for you to bring us along, but they had the best day of their lives. Thank you for that. A RUMBLE distracts Guy. He looks to the horizon. FIRES and SMOKE on the horizon mark the leading edge of the collapse. Eep comes to his side.
UGGA: ( TO GUY )
GUY: I want to show you something. Guy LIGHTS A TORCH and leads the Croods up, up, to the forest canopy. Guy BLOWS OUT his torch. The night sky is revealed in all its glory. The Croods are amazed. Music POUNDS as the spectacle SWEEPS around the Croods. Perched on the canopy of the forest the Croods seem to sit at the very brink of the universe.
THUNK: More suns in the sky than you can count.
GUY: Every sun that crosses our sky, comes to rest up there.
EEP: That's where we'll be safe. ON GRUG ARRIVING at the tree top. When he sees the stars he DUCKS back down, terrified. He overhears the rest of the conversation. Eep with tears in her eyes.
GUY: That's where we'll be safe. ON GRUG ARRIVING at the tree top. When he sees the stars he DUCKS back down, terrified. He overhears the rest of the conversation. Eep with tears in her eyes.
EEP: I'm going with Guy.
GRUG: ( WHISPERED )
EEP: Come with us.
UGGA: I can't go without Grug.
GRAN: Well, that makes one of us. Count me in!
UGGA: Really Mom? Now? Grug continues to listen in.
GRAN: Grug has no idea how to protect us. In fact, he has no ideas at all.
UGGA: No, that's not true. What about that one time when he a.
GRAN: Face it! If he actually had an idea of his own I'd, I'd have a heart attack and Grug smiles to himself.
ON GRUG: Grug smiles to himself.
ON UGGA: The whole family is searching for Grug. He has
UGGA: The whole family is searching for Grug. He has
THUNK: He's a big guy. How can he just disappear like that?
EEP: He's a big guy. How can he just disappear like that?
GUY: He's a big guy. How can he just disappear like that?
THUNK: Hey wait. Let's ask that ugly lady if she's seen dad.
UGA: Grug SPINS AROUND. He's wearing a rasta-style wig made from knotted grass. The sight SHOCKS Ugga.
GRUG: Haven't seen him.
UGGA: ON GRUG with the family standing around him.
GRUG: ( Playing to Eep ) Yeah, Wow. Like, I was up all night cuz like all these, ideas just kept coming to Grug LIFTS his tunic, a Boa Constrictor is wrapped around his waist.
GUY: Is that a snake?
GRUG: Belt! New and improved! It's even self- tightening. Ow! The constrictor SQUEEZES Grug till he turns blue. Grug SMACKS it and it relaxes a little.
UGGA: What is that on your head?
GRAN: It's called desperation. Grug strokes his weird, fake rasta-hair.
GRUG: ( swings his long hair around ) I call it a "rug." Rhymes with Grug. And this one. I call it a "ride." Rhymes with Grug. Grug regards a boulder as if it's a Ferrari.
GUY: That, doesn't
GRUG: It's gonna get us places faster than Grug climbs on top of the rock, facing the wrong way.
THUNK: I wish I had a ride.
ON THUNK: His face SLATHERED with reddish mud.
GRUG: Painting is a thing of the past. I call this, a "snap-shot." Grug takes a huge flat stone and SMASHES it against Thunk, forcibly transferring the mud image to the rock. Grug shows the Croods.
THUNK: Let's do it again. I think I blinked. Thunk PASSES OUT.
GRUG: I call them "shades."
THUNK: The sun doesn't hurt my eyes anymore! Where do you get these great ideas?
GRUG: Since I don't have a brain, they're coming from my stomach. Down deep below, and then up again into my mind. Thunk walks into a tree. All the other Croods RAISE their "shades" in time to see Grug walk over a cliff.
GUY: Grug. We have to keep moving.
ON GRUG: See, I got ideas, I got thoughts. ON Grug lifting a huge flat rock over his head.
GRUG: See, I got ideas, I got thoughts. ON Grug lifting a huge flat rock over his head.
ON GRUG: Standing on one side of a primitive Teeter-Totter.
EEP: I know. It's bad. Grug tosses a massive boulder on the opposite end. Grug is LAUNCHED into the sky. Grug becomes a speck in the sky. He is HIT by LIGHTNING.
UGGA: I know. It's bad. Grug tosses a massive boulder on the opposite end. Grug is LAUNCHED into the sky. Grug becomes a speck in the sky. He is HIT by LIGHTNING.
GRAN: I almost feel sorry for him.
UGGA: What are you trying to do Grug?
ON GRUG: Burned and battered, laying in the bottom of a turtle shell boat. Ugga is attending to his injuries.
GRUG: I thought if I could have ideas like Guy, maybe Eep would listen to me. Maybe she wouldn't want to go with Guy. Ugga gets a PAINED look on her face.
UGGA: Oh Grug, is that what this is all about? Ugga is about to confess her thoughts of going to Tomorrow with Guy when Grug interrupts her.
GRUG: And I also thought it would kill your mother. So you know? Win win.
GUY: We're here. The view of the mountain is beautiful. Thousands of birds fly overhead darkening the sky. The shell boat hits the shore. The Croods step out onto An explosion goes off on a nearby mountain. A PLUME of magma BURSTS from the water in the distance. Grug looks around for shelter and spots a cave.
GRUG: Cave! Everyone inside. Come on! Hurry up, let's go. Go, go. The Croods don't want to move.
EEP: ( GENTLY )
UGGA: ( GENTLY )
GRUG: We're gonna jump on the sun and ride it to Tomorrow with Guy.
GRAN: We're gonna jump on the sun and ride it to Tomorrow with Guy.
GRUG: Wait, so you're all going to do this? Silence from the Croods answers his question.
THUNK: Sorry, dad. Thunk joins the others. It's the last straw.
EEP: You have to stop worrying for all of us.
GRUG: It's my job to worry. It's my job to follow the rules.
EEP: The rules don't work out here.
GRUG: They kept us alive.
EEP: That wasn't living, that was just, not dying. There's a difference.
GRUG: Ugga, everyone, you have to listen to me. Ugga doesn't move.
EEP: We would be dead if we listened you. Grug is STUNNED.
GRUG: Guy, run. Grug lunges toward Guy, SCREAMING.
UGGA: Guy, run. Grug lunges toward Guy, SCREAMING.
GRUG: Grug ATTACKS Guy - they fall down an embankment.
AAAAAAAAAAUGHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!: Grug ATTACKS Guy - they fall down an embankment.
GUY: This is pointless. We're running out of time. Everything is collapsing. You're being irrational and counterproductive.
GRUG: Big words anger me. Keep talking.
GUY: Belt THROWS fruit at Grug. The fruit HITS Grug square in the face. He's blinded. He doesn't stop.
GRUG: I. am. a. CAVEMAN.
GUY: No, no, no wait. Guy and Grug do a slow-motion PLUNGE over a tar-fall. As they descend Grug SWINGS at Guy, coating himself with tar. Grug's arms are held like glue. His punches stop well short of Guy's face. Guy and Grug arrive in a wide pool of tar. They SINK slowly.
GRUG: Hnnnnnngh! No. What is this stuff that saves you from my punches?
GUY: ( HOLLOW ) GUY ( CONT'D )
GRUG: No. I have to get back to them.
GUY: Grug! Stop! Grug looks to Guy.
GRUG: Family. Yeah.
GUY: Family. Yeah.
GRUG: Grug looks at Guy again - he needs more than that. Guy takes a deep breath - this is going to be hard.
GUY: I was little when it happened. The last thing my parents told me was, "Don't hide. Live. Follow the Sun. You'll make it to Tomorrow." This resonates with Grug. A thread of light trickles through the storm, falling just near enough to Guy he can gather it in his palm.
GRUG: You followed the light. My daughter is a lot like you.
GUY: No. She's like you. She loves you but always forgets to say it. Just like you forget to tell her. Grug ponders this. A CHANGE comes over Grug. He focuses on Guy. This hits Grug hard.
GRUG: ( CRUSHED )
GUY: It's okay. That's what Dads do. Grug smiles. He regards Guy in a different light. He sees him not as a boy but a man. Someone good enough for his little girl.
GRUG: That's right. but we can't do that from here. We need one of your ideas. The music TURNS.
GUY: Belt! Emergency Idea Generator, Belt hits Guy in the head with a rock.
BELT: Yeah, I know. But he's doing the best with what he has. Let's go. Grug and Guy are holding bones connected to the puppet. Belt SIGNALS to Guy.
GRUG: Yeah, I know. But he's doing the best with what he has. Let's go. Grug and Guy are holding bones connected to the puppet. Belt SIGNALS to Guy.
GUY: Yeah, I know. But he's doing the best with what he has. Let's go. Grug and Guy are holding bones connected to the puppet. Belt SIGNALS to Guy.
GRUG: Scared? I'll show you scared. Hand me those acting sticks!
GUY: Hold on! The puppet breaks apart, the Macawnivcore turns to Grug and Guy. He is not pleased.
BELT: Da da daaaaaa. The Macawnivore dashes towards the pair. They try to run from him. The Macawnivore's paws slip slowly backwards into the nearby tarhe's stuck. The tar snaps him back and throws him far from Grug and Guy. Belt blows a whistle signalling a field goal!
GRUG: Yes. You did it! Grug PATS Guy on the back. Grug realizes his hand is stuck to Guy's back. The Croods come running to help them.
UGGA: Grug and Guy TURN to see the rest of the Croods. Grug waves to the family with Guy stuck to his hand.
THUNK: Grug and Guy TURN to see the rest of the Croods. Grug waves to the family with Guy stuck to his hand.
GUY: Hey, we're okay! The family stops to take this in.
GRUG: Take us to Tomorrow.
GUY: Hurry! Come on. We're gonna make it! When the Croods rush toward "Tomorrow," it is a golden, ethereal image created by a perfect alignment of sun, clouds, and mountain. From the Croods POV it looks as if they can cross a solid bridge of clouds and climb onto a waiting sun.
EEP: You were right.
GUY: There it is. The sun. We can do it! We can ride it to Tomorrow. Even Grug is taken with the sight - it's there after all. The Croods stare at the open meadow across from them. Tremors violently SHAKE the ground.
UGGA: We have to go back to the cave. Hurry, hurry, stay together. Let's keep moving. Move, move! Everybody hold my hand. Thunk let's go. Go! Let's stay But Grug doesn't join them. Instead, Grug takes a step TOWARD the precipice, peering into the curtain of ash as if trying to burn a hole straight through it.
GRUG: No more dark. No more hiding. No more What's the point of all this?
BEAT: GRUG ( CONT'D )
BEAT: GRUG ( CONT'D )
UGGA: No. We don't know what's over there. Maybe nothing. It's too risky.
GRUG: It's a chance. Belt wipes a tear off his face.
GUY: I'll take that chance. Grug LIFTS Guy above his head.
GRUG: You know, I've wanted to throw you away ever since I met you.
GUY: Heh. That's a joke, right?
GRUG: What's a joke? Grug's comment freaks Guy out. ANOTHER ANGLE shows Grug with a twinkle in his eye. Belt puts on his helmet for safety. With a titanic effort, he HURLS Guy in to the void. The Croods wait an eternity. Then - a HORN SOUNDS.
UGGA: He made it. He made it.
GRUG: Okay, Thunk. Your turn.
THUNK: You're not coming, are you?
GRUG: When you make it, so will I. Grug HURLS Thunk.
UGGA: You did good.
SANDY: Grug wipes a tear from Ugga's eye. Then lifts her above his head. He HURLS her across.
GRUG: Gran is next in line.
GRAN: No mush, just throw me. Grug LIFTS her above his head.
GRUG: Time to go.
EEP: No. I have too much to say to you. I need to fix everything and I don't have I can fix it. Grug embraces Eep.
GRUG: I can fix it. Grug embraces Eep.
EEP: This works good. What do you call it?
GRUG: I was thinking of calling it a Hug. ( clears his throat )
EEP: No. I like a "Hug."
GRUG: I love you. Eep takes in the full effect of her dad's words.
EEP: The ground begins to shake and break apart around them.
GRUG: Never be afraid. The gap grows wider. Grug lifts Eep and makes the greatest throw of his life. The tumult parts briefly. Grug can see his entire family safe on the other side. He waves a last goodbye. To his surprise, a shaft of sunlight has settled on his open There. I see him! The family waves to Grug to let him know they are okay.
GUY: There. I see him! The family waves to Grug to let him know they are okay.
GRUG: ( PLEASED ) GRUG ( CONT'D )
GRUG: They're in trouble. Hang on! I'm The scale of his problem sinks in.
MACAWNIVORE: CUT TO:
GRUG: Grug leaps onto the Macawnivore's back as the birds move in closer. The ground begins to break up violently as lakes empty themselves and entire forests turn sideways. The Macawnivore rushes into a giant rib cage that Grug has coated with tar. The Piranha Owls hit the rib cage and stick to it. As they fight to free themselves, the rib cage lifts off the ground. Grug takes a giant tree branch, ignites it, and uses it as a rudder, scaring the Piranha Owls and prompting them to fly in one coherent As the cage flies, above the fiery landscape, Grug sees Douglas, sitting forlornly with the shell still in his Grug doesn't even debate it, he runs back for the little Grug JUMPS out of the cage and rushes over to grab the gerbils. Then Grug notices a familiar Liyote hiding under a nearby rock. He GRABS the Liyote. Grug sees the TRIP-GERBILS stranded as well. Grug TWIRLS the Trip- Gerbils around his neck like a scarf.
ON EEP: Standing at the edge of the cliff alone, BLOWING her shell horn. Behind her, Sandy HOWLS. Gran puts a comforting arm around her grandchildren, even she has a tear in her eye. The ground begins to shake softly.
GUY: It's not safe here.
GRAN: I'll tell her. Gran walks up to Eep. Eep continues to blow her shell horn. Eep and Gran share a moment. Eep breaks into tears. Gran looks at her shell horn and BLOWS it loudly. Eep is happily surprised. The whole family, even Guy, steps up next to Eep and begins BLOWING their shell horns. It's clear from Eep's expression she has no intention of I never got to tell him. Ugga appeals to Eep.
EEP: I never got to tell him. Ugga appeals to Eep.
UGGA: Eep, if your Dad were here, he would tell
YOU TO: GRUG ( O.S. ) GET OUT OF THE WAY!!! Wow, you sound just like him. Ugga looks up. Guy LOOKS UP. Everyone looks up!
THUNK: Wow, you sound just like him. Ugga looks up. Guy LOOKS UP. Everyone looks up!
SANDY: He did it!
EEP: He did it!
GUY: He's riding the Sun. but not very well. Everybody out of the way! Grug CRASHES near the family. They run to meet him.
THUNK: Ahhh! Where's the danger? Who blew their But all Grug sees is his astonished family staring back at him. Eep RUNS to him, HUGS him ferociously, nearly knocking him down.
UGGA: Ahhh! Where's the danger? Who blew their But all Grug sees is his astonished family staring back at him. Eep RUNS to him, HUGS him ferociously, nearly knocking him down.
GRUG: Ahhh! Where's the danger? Who blew their But all Grug sees is his astonished family staring back at him. Eep RUNS to him, HUGS him ferociously, nearly knocking him down.
EEP: I love you too. The rest of the Croods begin running to Grug. Grug hugs each of them like never before.
GRUG: One, two, three, four, five, six. Grug puts his arm around Guy.
BELT: And a half. All the animals join in hugging Grug.
GRUG: And a half. All the animals join in hugging Grug.
THUNK: Douglas! Dad you saved him!
GRUG: Well, a boys gotta have a pet. Suddenly the group rises up as the Macawnivore stands near them.
EEP: You really need to see this. The whole family takes this amazing view in then looks to Grug for his decision.
GRUG: We should go there.
THUNK: Let's do that again. I think I blinked. BACK TO THE SHORELINE, RUSHING ever closer to the beach.
EEP: Our world is still plenty harsh and hostile. But now we know the Croods will make it. ON BELT riding on the back of the Crocopup, delivering a drink to Gran, PULL OUT to reveal she is in a sled, hitched to a team of Liyotes. The liyotes are tending to her. Gran sips her drink.
GRUG: Release the baby!
EEP: Well, sort of. Thunk breaks through the trees riding a LANDWHALE. Sandy and Belt are riding the Crocopup. Eep and Guy are riding the BearOwl.
BEAT: Belt and Sandy poke their heads up at the base of the
