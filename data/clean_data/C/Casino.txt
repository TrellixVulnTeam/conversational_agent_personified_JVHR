ACE: You fuckin' piece of shit.
LESTER: Hey, that's just fuckin' - That's bullshit. You know, you know, what the fuck?
ACE: You remember when you called him that night? When you said goodbye to him? He didn't say, 'Don't get married, I'll be right down, we'll get married.' He didn't say that to you, did he?
GINGER: ( Whispering ) No, he didn't.

GINGER: ( Throwing the iron on the counter ) He's such a prick. He had some guy from the hotel beat him up. He didn't want to do it himself. Oh, no, he didn't want to get his own hands
GINGER: So, why'd he have to do that, huh?
GINGER: Tell me.
NICKY: I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
GINGER: ( Interrupts ) Yeah, no shit.
NICKY: Well, you gotta understand it. He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you.
GINGER: No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise.
NICKY: Oh, you did? I didn't know that.
GINGER: Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so. so what?
NICKY: You know. the first time I ever saw your guys together. I never saw him so happy. I mean, I know he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything,
NICKY: I never see - You know, I never seen him act like that with anybody else. I think he's crazy about you. I mean, he really loves you. He does.
GINGER: Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right? You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
NICKY: Am I right?
GINGER: Am I right?
NICKY: I can see that. Sure.
GINGER: So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
NICKY: You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?
GINGER: Mm, you want to steal it?
NICKY: No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more.
GINGER: I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more.
NICKY: Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?
GINGER: I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini. Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake. I mean it.
NICKY: I know what you mean.
NICKY: Listen, Ginger. you know, this is probably not. I don't have the answers anyway. and this is probably not what you want to hear right now, because you're a little upset with I do.
GINGER: I do.
NICKY: I understand that. But, you know, I think you should try to make the best of it now. Go slow, you know. See what happens.
GINGER: He could have killed him! Okay? He could have killed him.
GINGER: He didn't have to hit him. It's not exactly like I'm sleepin' with the guy! And he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! What the fuck is that all about?
NICKY: Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried.
GINGER: ( Sighs, her voice starts to crack ) He gives a fuck what I do?
NICKY: ( Getting up ) Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
GINGER: All right?
NICKY: All right?
GINGER: ( Walking over to him, smiling. )
GINGER: Thanks for puttin' up with me.
NICKY: And take it easy with this shit, will you? I mean, this can only make matters worse.
GINGER: Oh, come on.
NICKY: You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
GINGER: ( Fidgeting with his jacket, then holding his face in her hands, smiling. ) You're so nice. ( She begins to cry. )
NICKY: Come on, now, I don't want to see you unhappy.
GINGER: ( Tenderly strokes his head )
NICKY: She embraces NICKY, wrapping her arms around him.

SECRETARY: ( Into telephone ) Mr Rothstein? County Commissioner Pat Webb is here to see you.
ACE: ( Over telephone ) ( Into telephone ) .give me a minute.
ACE: ( Into telephone ) .give me a minute.
SECRETARY: ( Over telephone )
SECRETARY: ( To WEBB ) It'll just be a minute.
SECRETARY: Mr Webb. Can I get you anything?
WEBB: Oh, no. No, thank you, little lady.
ACE: ( Into telephone ) Okay, send him in and call me four minutes after. Mr Rothstein. ( With hand outstretched to ACE. ) I'm Pat Webb.
WEBB: Mr Rothstein. I'm Pat Webb.
ACE: How do you do?
WEBB: Hey, it is my pleasure.
ACE: Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
WEBB: Oh, thank you, sir. Hey, house is doin' well. Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant.
WEBB: Hey, house is doin' well. Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant.
ACE: No, that's quite all right.
ACE: Why don't you have a seat?
WEBB: Hm? Oh. Thank you, sir.
WEBB: Uh, I come here personally to kind of smooth over a fracas about a certain matter. See, uh, maybe you didn't know it, but, uh, Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town. He's got lots of friends here. Now, his family and their money go back many, many years. Now, friends vote. family and money votes. That's important to me. and you. And if you'll think about our little problem along them lines. and you forgive me for sayin' it, maybe he did not deserve to be fired.
ACE: I'm sorry, but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. That means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on. Either way, I cannot have a man like that workin' here.
WEBB: Before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges.
ACE: Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.
WEBB: Are, uh - - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?
ACE: I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him.
WEBB: ( Chuckling ) You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar. ( Chuckles. ) But, he is my brother-in-law, and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back.
ACE: I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do that.
WEBB: Well, could there be any position. further down the trough?
ACE: ( Pause ) I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted.
ACE: ( Into telephone ) Okay, thanks. ( To WEBB. ) Um. you know, that's it. I'm sorry.
WEBB: Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner. you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor. Thank you for your time.
ACE: No problem. You bet.
WEBB: ( Smiles slightly ) You bet.
ACE: What happened to my pills?
GINGER: ( Waving the pill bottle ) Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills I didn't take your pills.
ACE: ( Waving the pill bottle ) Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills I didn't take your pills.
GINGER: I didn't take your pills.
ACE: Look - for my ulcer, I take a half a one of these, a half a one of these. And that's when I have extreme pain. I had a three-month supply. What'd you do with 'em?
GINGER: ( Sobbing ) You didn't have to beat him up!
ACE: ( Walking back to the bathroom )
GINGER: ( Sobbing ) I was just tryin' to help him. It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy!
ACE: Yeah, how do I know?
GINGER: ( Sobbing ) You can't make me stop caring.
ACE: What? What?!
GINGER: I said, you can't make me stop caring about people.
ACE: ( Trying to calm her ) ( Stepping up to the bed. ) Ginger. I'm tryin' to make the best of everything here, you know? I mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes. Uh, I mean. people look up to you in this town. I don't know what to think -
GINGER: ( Interrupts ) You know what, Ace? I don't give a shit! I'm gettin' out of here. ( Crying. ) I am.
ACE: ( Walking around the bed to her ) It's okay. Look. ( holding her face, gently ) .you gotta get a hold of yourself.
GINGER: If not for me, at least for Amy.
ACE: If not for me, at least for Amy.
GINGER: ( Sobbing ) Okay, okay.
ACE: ( Gently ) You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.
GINGER: I don't need one.
ACE: Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff.
GINGER: That's all you care about. You don't care about me at all.
ACE: ( Bending down to her ) Yes, I - yes, I do.
GINGER: No, you don't.
ACE: How could you say that? You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than You can do it. You can do it.
GINGER: ( Sobbing ) Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay. Okay. I'll try. I'll try.
GINGER: I'll try. I will. Don't be mad at me, okay. I will.

GAGGI: What the hell's he gonna do now?
STONE: I don't know
GAGGI: What's he doin'? He knows all those guys he yelled at are friends of ours. What's the matter with him, making all this mess?
STONE: Maybe he could run things with another job title. Wouldn't be the best, but, uh, what are we gonna do?
GAGGI: However he runs things, it's gotta be quiet. Let him hide upstairs in the office. Say he's the janitor, I don't give a shit. But, please, whatever job he takes, make sure it's something quiet.

STONE: What do you propose?
ACE: I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should. get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad?
STONE: They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.
ACE: All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying.
STONE: I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out.
ACE: ( Sighs ) I can't do that.
