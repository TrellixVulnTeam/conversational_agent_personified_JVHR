PRODUCTION DRAFT: April 14, 2000
JUNIOR: Hear the big news, Lieutenant? It's the twenty-first century. We got electricity now.
JUNIOR: Got these supermarkets, too. Big places, freezers full o' ice
GORDY: Open up.
GORDY: Screw the twenty-first century.
GORDY: Second alarm. Multiple dwelling between Third and Lex.
GORDY: Top story's fully involved. We're supporting inside. Two lines up the stairs.
GORDY: Junior and Mike
GORDY: Sal and Ronnie.
GORDY: Stairs're screwed. Hug the wall.
GORDY: Knock it back! Two floors up. I heard screaming. Couldn't get there.
FIREFIGHTER #1: Two floors up. I heard screaming. Couldn't get there.
GORDY: FIREFIGHTER #1
FIREFIGHTER #1: End of the hall.
GORDY: Give me the hose!
MIKE: This place is gone! It could flashover any second!
GORDY: Give me the goddamn hose!
GORDY: It's okay. Esta bien, esta bien. Come with me. Con mio.
MATT: Look what we made!
ANNE: Nice rocket. That took a while.
GORDY: He was awake when I got home. His throat still hurts.
ANNE: That's a bad word.
MATT: That's a bad word.
GORDY: You're right.
ANNE: She feels Matt's forehead. Gordy's done it already.
GORDY: No fever.
ANNE: ( to Matt ) You better see Dr. Bob. ( to Gordy ) And this time, no opening fire hydrants to play in till he's completely well.
GORDY: Yes, ma'am.
ANNE: How was your shift?
GORDY: ( shrugs ) The usual.
ANNE: Dreamed I did a triple axel in an ice skating championship.
GORDY: ( beat; calls after Come back and let me see those legs again.
ANNE: Dr. Bob can squeeze him in at twelve. I have a patient relations meeting at twelve- fifteen. Can you take him?
GORDY: I have a game. But yeah, if we do the handoff at the doctor's.
ANNE: ( into phone ) Yes, he'll be there. Thanks. ( hangs up; to Gordy ) Five-of in front of Dr. Bob's. Don't be late. ( to Matt ) Let's get you out, sweetie. Your father just can't keep you dry.
GORDY: Luis, get back! Pick up your man!
GORDY: We lose, win, whatever. But one thing we never do. We never, ever give up. Right?
GORDY: Seeing Gordy approach, the gangbanger and crew drift off. Reaching Luis
GORDY: What was that about?
LUIS: Told 'em I wouldn't play with 'em
GORDY: Try Fifth.
GORDY: He jams money in the pay dish.
GORDY: I'm getting outta here.
GORDY: Gordy reaches the corner. Sees Anne and Matt. Whistles. In b.g., behind Gordy, we see the cop get into a brown 34 ANNE AND MATT 34 hear the WHISTLE. Matt sees Gordy.
MATT: There he is.
GORDY: He tries to stand, then falls down, screaming in pain, a large shard of glass embedded in his leg. People come to help him, but Gordy only cares about finding Anne and Matt. He looks around desperately but can't see them, when. His eyes go to the spaceship, in pieces on the pavement.
GORDY: 45 EXT. COLOMBIAN CONSULATE 45
PARAMEDIC #1: We're gonna give you a shot.
GORDY: I need to see them!
PARAMEDIC #1: We gotta help you right now.

DRAY: Device functioned in front of the Colombian Consulate just as a motorcade full of brass arrived.
PHIPPS: Who were the brass, and why were they here?
DRAY: No one's talking yet, but it smells high-level. There were Colombians and Americans in the cars. Three of 'em ate it. Guy on the phone
DRAY: is one of the survivors. Name's Brandt. C.I.A.

DRAY: We've been giving him room.
JUNIOR: Gordy looks up him, meets his eyes.
JUNIOR: Me and Mike are here.
GORDY: . I was late. They shouldn't have been there.
JUNIOR: It's not your fault.
GORDY: I need to see them.
MIKE: No. You don't need to see 'em that way, Gordo.
JUNIOR: Get those goddamn people outta
PHIPPS: Put that tape out fifty more
PARAMEDIC #1: He needs to go to the hospital. We can't take that glass out.
MIKE: If he's not bleeding to death, leave him. He's not moving till they do.
PHIPPS: Chalk 'em and move 'em.
PHIPPS: We gotta get on this quick. I need to talk to him.
PHIPPS: Mr. Pitt, if you can you tell me. What'd you see?
GORDY: ( looks up; beat ) What'd I see? I saw my family
MIKE: This guy didn't do the bombing, Gordo. He's just trying to get the people who did.
GORDY: I didn't see anything except the
PHIPPS: I know this is hard. I'm sorry I had to bother you.
MIKE: We're gonna roll you to the hospital now and get that glass
PHIPPS: Joe Phipps. F.B.I. Counter- terrorism task force.
BRANDT: Mike Brandt.
PHIPPS: What got this place blown up?
BRANDT: We'll have this discussion somewhere else more secure, after I get your clearance.
PHIPPS: Whatever it takes. But I got a bomber in the wind. I need everything you can give me, and I need it now.
ANOTHER ANGLE: Mike is on a cell phone nearby as Sal, the other veteran from the engine company, enters and approaches him. Into the phone
MIKE: Hang on.
SAL: Tell me about it.
MIKE: Tell me about it.
SAL: How's he holding up?
MIKE: He's shut down. We were hoping they'd keep him here, and he wouldn't have to go home right away, but they're cutting him Want me to stay at home with him?
SAL: Want me to stay at home with him?
MIKE: Rookie's taking the first shift. I'm just getting the schedule at the firehouse rearranged now.
SAL: Hey. Got here as fast as I could.
SAL: I know it sucks. It really
SAL: How's the leg?
RONNIE: Cut's deep, but no major vessels were severed. He's got a load 'o silk holding it all together.
JUNIOR: Just came over the police radio. Consulate surveillance cameras caught the bomber in the act. He was disguised as a cop. . I saw him. I saw a cop.
GORDY: . I saw him. I saw a cop.
SAL: Christ. Gordy.
GORDY: I gotta help 'em get the bastard.
PHIPPS: How long before we have a secure computer network?
DRAY: An hour. They're building it now.
PHIPPS: What do you got?
PHIPPS: Do it.
PHIPPS: Run a total analysis. I want to know if this asshole's right or left-handed. I want everything you can get outta this film.
PHIPPS: Any helpful information coming outta Colombia?
AGENT: Not yet. Sat-Intel hasn't picked up any related data-traffic,
DRAY: Gordon Pitt's here. He says he saw a cop at the scene.
PHIPPS: The cart was stolen from the Central Park Precinct yesterday.
GORDY: That's him. That's the son of a bitch I bumped into.
PHIPPS: The bomb's in the cart.
PHIPPS: We think the bomb was triggered by a cell phone. The guy doesn't have one in his hands here. Did you see a cell phone when you ran into him?
GORDY: . No.
PHIPPS: How much time passed between then and the explosion?
GORDY: . Seconds. Five, ten.
PHIPPS: We think maybe he got into the brown Ford. You see him then?
GORDY: All I cared about was getting to my wife and boy.
DRAY: ( to Phipps ) Guy still had enough time to get out a phone and dial it in.
PHIPPS: ( beat, then, by way We might need to call you in again to look at some photos.
GORDY: . I touched him.
GORDY: How's that for collateral damage?
PHIPPS: Mr. Ortiz-Dominguez has agreed not to press charges if you make full I've already paid. With my
GORDY: I've already paid. With my
PHIPPS: Take care of it.
PHIPPS: Gordy, this is Mike Brandt.
BRANDT: Mr. Pitt.
BRANDT: I'm very sorry for your loss. I lost people, too.
PHIPPS: . Mike was in the motorcade that day. He's the chief U.S. intelligence officer overseeing Don't worry, Mr. Pitt, we're gonna get the son-of-a-bitch.
BRANDT: Don't worry, Mr. Pitt, we're gonna get the son-of-a-bitch.
GORDY: You know where he is?
BRANDT: We believe The Wolf's in hiding in an area of Colombia controlled by the E.L.C., extreme Marxist guerrillas. He thinks he's in a safe haven.
PHIPPS: I know it's hard for you right now, Mr. Pitt. We're all sorry. But why don't you go home. We're taking care of things.
BRANDT: Here's my card. Call me any time.
GORDY: What kind of twisted people do things like this?
OROSCO: You interested in the big picture or all the unpleasant details?
GORDY: My family died because of what's going on down there. I want to know all I can.
OROSCO: Well, basically, the situation in Colombia sucks.
MIKE: Haven't heard from you in a couple Been busy.
GORDY: Been busy.
MIKE: Yeah. I can see that.
GORDY: E.L.C. attack platoon. These assholes kill innocent people all the time in Colombia.
GORDY: Thirteen dead in a bus. A market. Twenty-seven dead. A whole family. Anne and Matt didn't mean shit to them. Or him.
MIKE: Hey, we never turned down free beer, and rookie's buying, you believe that? He certified today, he's off probation.
GORDY: ( still looking at Ronnie couldn't find a fire with both hands.
MIKE: ( smiles ) Yeah. Let's go tell him that.
MIKE: C'mon, Gordo.
MIKE: We aren't gonna let 'em drink all the beer, are we?
MIKE: Low on beer, Ronnie.
RONNIE: Yeah. I'll get more.
MIKE: I'll tell you what'll be great: when you get back to work with us.
JUNIOR: Yeah, how long is it?
SAL: Week, two weeks?
GORDY: Shrinks say ten more days.
SAL: Like I said.
MIKE: Fucking doorknob they put in temporary command.
GORDY: Morgan, the guy from 23, right?
JUNIOR: What a jerkoff.
SAL: Even makes you look good, Gordo.
RONNIE: Hey, Gordy
GORDY: I'm gone three weeks and this place falls apart.
JUNIOR: The temp lieutenant put it out back, and Art hit it with his We're having problems with the portable pump again, too.
RONNIE: ( calls to Gordy ) We're having problems with the portable pump again, too.
GORDY: Who backed over that?. My tools still here?
SAL: Upstairs in your locker.
GORDY: Figured you guys would've sold my stuff at a yard sale by now.
GORDY: You ever stay on one channel long enough to hear what they're
GORDY: Go back! Go back!
MIKE: But Gordy has charged in and grabs the remote from Mike, switches channels back to CNN.
MIKE: This guy, Quaddafi, that Bin Laden. We never get these
BRANDT: . Senator, the failure of one operation shouldn't cause your committee to question financing everything else we're doing down
BRANDT: . I know it looks bad, and I appreciate your support. Together we'll get it done. Yeah. 'bye. Without his father's money, that asshole'd be keeping bees for a living. What?
UPDEGRAF: Gordy Pitt's on the phone.
BRANDT: He's called every day.
UPDEGRAF: He's called every day.
BRANDT: I don't need it.
UPDEGRAF: Mr. Pitt, Mr. Brandt'll have to get back to you.
GORDY: Tell him not to bother.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER: Business or pleasure, senor?
GORDY: . Pleasure. One moment, senor.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER: One moment, senor.
IMMIGRATION SUPERIOR: If you would come with me, Is there a problem?
GORDY: Is there a problem?
IMMIGRATION SUPERIOR: We know who you are, Mr. Pitt.
GORDY: Says so right there in my We're aware your wife and child were killed in the bombing in New We have C.N.N. here, too. It's better for you to visit another country. For your own . You giving me a choice?
IMMIGRATION SUPERIOR: We're aware your wife and child were killed in the bombing in New We have C.N.N. here, too. It's better for you to visit another country. For your own . You giving me a choice?
GORDY: . You giving me a choice?
IMMIGRATION SUPERIOR: Yes. But not about staying in
IMMIGRATION SUPERIOR: These men will escort you onto whatever flight you wish.
IMMIGRATION SUPERIOR: It's The Wolf you're after, yes?
IMMIGRATION SUPERIOR: . Then I've just done you a bigger favor than you know.
DAY: Gordy's flanked by the armed policemen, one with a Rottweiler. As they walk, a PA announcement in Spanish is repeated in English.
CAB DRIVER: My cousin, Ever.
GORDY: How far's Colombia?
CAB DRIVER: Beyond those mountains. The trail is very dangerous, but do not worry, Ever will get you there. You can pay him then. You can pay me now.
CAB DRIVER: Gracias, senor.
CAB DRIVER: Que la vaya bien.
GORDY: Aqui? Colombia?.
COLOMBIAN GIRL: She jumps backward over the line.
COLOMBIAN GIRL: She does it again.
COLOMBIAN GIRL: Panama. Colombia.
GORDY: The little girl runs back again, and Gordy watches the refugees disappear around the bend. Then turns back uphill and approaches the line the little girl drew in the dirt. Looks down at it. Crossing over means he walks into a world dangerous enough to cause these people to flee for their lives, and. Just as Gordy charged into the fire-engulfed tenement past a tide of more sensible rats going the other way, he now steps over the line and advances into Colombia.
BRANDT: Find your fucking leak?
ROCHA: Not yet. And it could be your fucking leak.
BRANDT: All due respect, Noel, it's not likely. And we don't need the whole world looking into what we're doing down here. We find the son-of-a-bitch again, we're bypassing protocols.
UPDEGRAF: Check this out.
BRANDT: Jesus Christ.
UPDEGRAF: ( to Rocha ) The man whose wife and son died in New York. One of your units found his passport and credit cards on some gunrunners near Panama. Gunrunners say they left him What, he thinks he can get The Wolf himself?
BRANDT: What, he thinks he can get The Wolf himself?
ROCHA: We have too much time and too many people invested to have a loose cannon walking around.
BRANDT: ( beat; hands papers Throw out the net. Have him picked up. Just make sure no one kills him.
ONCOMING DRIVER: Inspecion militar. Chequeo de
GORDY: Habla Ingles?. Que pasa?
GORDY: Where are all of you going?
GORDY: None of these people have papers?
OLDER MAN: Gordy realizes the old man's saying "land mine." To the young woman
GORDY: Gordy moves to catch her. Just manages to stop her as she reaches the far bank. Gordy points to where the land mine detonated.
GORDY: Mina. Mina.
GORDY: 115 GORDY 115
GORDY: Don't move. Don't move.
GORDY: You'll be okay. You'll be okay.
GORDY: Guerrilla bastards.
GORDY: No! Alto!
COLOMBIAN WOMAN: No autobusses para este lugar. Solamente el barco en el rio. El rio.
COLOMBIAN WOMAN: El rio.
ARMSTRONG: Hey, yo, dude, here's a seat, man!
GORDY: No, that's okay
ARMSTRONG: I was hoping for someone I could communicate with.
ARMSTRONG: Only room's at the back near the bano, and I'd advise against it, unless you like poop.
ARMSTRONG: Philip Armstrong. Assiniboia, Sasketchewan, Canada. Deerborn Heavy Equipment.
GORDY: . Gordy Pitt.
ARMSTRONG: Hey, howya doing? I love Germany.
GORDY: Austria. American now.
ARMSTRONG: I love America. Never been to Austria. Where from in America would that be?
GORDY: New York City.
ARMSTRONG: I don't like New York City. Buildings're too big. What kinda work you in?
GORDY: ( hesitates, then ) Coffee. I buy beans.
ARMSTRONG: Can't drink caffeine. Makes my stomach do the rumba. I like that commercial guy with the sombrero and the mule, though. Headed upstream, eh? Where to?
GORDY: . You've never been to Caguan, How do you know?
ARMSTRONG: . You've never been to Caguan, How do you know?
GORDY: How do you know?
ARMSTRONG: 'Cause no one in their right mind would ever go back. Caguan's in the guerrilla zone run by the E.L.C. E.L.C. as in 'Extra Loathsome Communists.' They don't care, and they kill. I'm going there myself. But I have a 'get outta jail free' card.
ARMSTRONG: E.L.C. travel pass. I can go anywhere I want. Everyone needs equipment fixed.
ARMSTRONG: If you don't have one of these, you don't want to be up there,
GORDY: Por favor.
GORDY: Con mucho gusto.
ARMSTRONG: Got kids, eh?
UPDEGRAF: One of Rocha's infiltration teams just radioed in. We got our big
ARMSTRONG: That little kid and I had a nice, long snooze. We're almost to Beautiful country.
GORDY: It better be. A lotta people're dying for it.
ARMSTRONG: ( looks overboard ) Y'know, I haven't noticed one darn body floating downstream this whole trip, have you?
GORDY: I was thinking. Maybe we could travel together into Caguan. You could show me around.
ARMSTRONG: ( shakes his head ) Pass is only good for one person, if that's your idea, which I think it is. Besides, I can't risk traveling around up there in the company of a big gringo with a dumb-ass cover story about coffee
GORDY: I've got money. I'll buy the pass from you.
ARMSTRONG: I've worked too hard for it. And you don't have that kind of money on you.
GORDY: I'll be getting some life insurance money
ARMSTRONG: ( shaking his head ) It's all cash and carry down here,
ARMSTRONG: Mompos. You want to have some fun, we'll hook up later. I always schedule a stopover. To sample the local wares and such. Life can be what you make it here on the frontier.
GORDY: No, thanks.
ARMSTRONG: Gotta get off the boat anyway. Mompos is the last stop. From here into the guerrilla zone you can only travel by panga. If you change your mind, I'll be at the Tropicale later. It's a gringo bar. Just follow the cockroaches.
ARMSTRONG: Sicarios. Death squads. Avoid those dudes at all costs.
ARMSTRONG: Federales are looking for someone.
FAT FEDERALE: Senor Pitt?
FAT FEDERALE: You'll have to come with us.
GORDY: FAT FEDERALE
FAT FEDERALE: Come with us, please.
ARMSTRONG: I never met a nose I couldn't hang a spoon on.
ARMSTRONG: And now Armstong also realizes something's up. Turns and sees Gordy. Sees the cap in Gordy's hand as the Fat Federale addresses Gordy
FAT FEDERALE: Come along, Mr. Pitt.
ARMSTRONG: Police catch you trying to steal my hat, you asshole?!
ARMSTRONG: Fucking hat thief!
ARMSTRONG: Get outta here
FAT FEDERALE: Armstrong's still unsteady on his feet and sits down on the metal bunk.
ARMSTRONG: That stun gun wasn't cool.
ARMSTRONG: Haven't peed my pants in a real long time.
GORDY: ( beat ) You shouldn't have helped me.
ARMSTRONG: Yeah, well, I guess all these assholes down here are just starting on my nerves.
ARMSTRONG: So what the hell did you do to land us in here? And don't jerk me around, eh?
GORDY: The Wolf killed my wife and son in New York.
ARMSTRONG: . Oh, you're that guy, eh? I'm sorry, man. And what, you came down here to even things out?
ARMSTRONG: Did you even have a plan?
GORDY: Yeah. Go to Caguan, find The Wolf and kill him.
ARMSTRONG: Beat. Armstrong sees the look on Gordy's face. By way of a warning
ARMSTRONG: If you can't kill them, don't even talk to them.
BRANDT: Enjoy your trip?
BRANDT: We asked you to leave it to us.
GORDY: And you guys still haven't got It's not over yet. The guys next door are in The Wolf's elite bodyguard unit. Where he goes, they go. We're gonna ask questions. And we're gonna get answers. And you're staying right here till our bomber's dead.
BRANDT: It's not over yet. The guys next door are in The Wolf's elite bodyguard unit. Where he goes, they go. We're gonna ask questions. And we're gonna get answers. And you're staying right here till our bomber's dead.
GORDY: Don't breathe.
ARMSTRONG: ( weakly ) You're not running through the fire, eh?
GORDY: Close your mouth.
GORDY: I'll find a boat to take us
ARMSTRONG: No. I told you. The pass is only good for one person. And you're too dangerous to travel with.
ARMSTRONG: It hasn't been there since we
ARMSTRONG: Aw, hell. I was through with this place anyway.
ARMSTRONG: I'll call ahead and tell Felix I'm not coming, and you're my replacement. He'll meet you in Caguan and take you to the plantation. What do you know about diesel engines?
GORDY: All the fire trucks are diesels.
ARMSTRONG: You'll have to be Austrian, eh? They hate Americans. Name's gotta change, too, in case they're watching the news. It'll buy you a little time to look around Caguan. But you'll never find The Wolf.
GORDY: Heinrich Beckmann.
ARMSTRONG: My Austrian name.
GORDY: My Austrian name.
ARMSTRONG: Luck got you this far. But up there, luck doesn't make it. I hope you know you're gonna die.
BOATMAN: La zona guerrillera.
FELIX: Come with me.
GORDY: Come with me.
FELIX: Come with me.
FELIX: Armstrong should have called sooner. We don't like changes here. If I didn't need the equipment fixed, I'd send you
FELIX: But now we have to see the E.L.C. Supervisor for Caguan.
ELC SUPERVISOR: Your passport was stolen.
GORDY: In Mompos.
ELC SUPERVISOR: . Mompos is a shithole. Not like Caguan. Why didn't Armstrong come?
GORDY: He was arrested in Ecuador. He got drunk and fooled around with a police officer's wife.
FELIX: ( in Spanish ) We need to fix the equipment. We have delivery deadlines to meet.
ELC SUPERVISOR: ( in Spanish ) He's your responsibility. Don't let him out of your sight.
FELIX: Si. Gracias.
FELIX: The Supervisor made you my responsibility. You don't go anywhere without me, you No problemo.
GORDY: No problemo.
GORDY: The E.L.C. guards your coffee
FELIX: . Coffee beans? Shit. Armstrong didn't tell you much.
FELIX: The problem's with the diesel generators. The sons-of-bitches keep breaking down.
FELIX: We're using portables to keep production going, but they don't supply enough power to the heat lamps, and we have to dry a lot of. 'coffee beans.'
FELIX: We can fix anything, but these keep dying on us. You'll start now. I'll have tools brought to Armstrong's a magician with them. Let's hope you have his skill.
FELIX: Gordy has to think of something fast. Beat. He throws a machine part against a wall angrily.
GORDY: I can't work with these pieces of Junk? These generators cost a Then treat them that way.
FELIX: Junk? These generators cost a Then treat them that way.
GORDY: Then treat them that way.
FELIX: ( beat, then ) Armstrong always fixes them.
GORDY: Armstrong wants your money. He makes them work, but he doesn't fix them. To do this right, we gotta order parts from Europe. In the meantime, I can make something temporary. There must be a machine shop in town.
FELIX: . Yes.
GORDY: Let's go.
FELIX: Let's get moving.
GORDY: I'm thirsty. How about you? Want to get something to drink?
FELIX: We have to get back.
GORDY: I've been working all day out in the sun. I need a drink. nice cold beer? How about it? I saw a bar in town.
GORDY: With the spare parts, I'll have the generators running in two hours. We have time for a couple beers.
FELIX: Okay. Just a beer. Maybe two.
FELIX: This is mine. This is the reason I come here. right, Berta? Me Si, amor.
BERTA: ( playing along ) Si, amor.
FELIX: . She's hot, isn't she?
GORDY: Long beat. Gordy makes the play he's been contemplating.
GORDY: Armstrong said to watch my butt around here. I guess the fucking Americans come down and shoot everyone all the time.
FELIX: Especially now, since the bomb in New York.
GORDY: Yeah, I heard about it. Who did
FELIX: The Wolf, and they'll never catch Ever see him?
GORDY: Ever see him?
FELIX: ( beat; eyes Gordy ) If you know too much around here, it can get you killed.
GORDY: ( beat; eyes Gordy ) If you know too much around here, it can get you killed.
FELIX: ( beat; eyes Gordy ) If you know too much around here, it can get you killed.
GORDY: Tell me what doesn't get you killed around here.
GORDY: We'd better get back, huh?
FELIX: ( checks his watch ) . Shit. It's late.
GORDY: You're too drunk. I'll drive.
FELIX: One day, I'm going to screw Berta.
FELIX: . I'll take her to a small restaurant. We'll have lobster and drink lots of wine. I'll get her drunk. We'll drive home. I'll carry her inside. I'll kiss her. And then, I'll screw her in my bed.
FELIX: . And when I am done screwing her, she'll never want to look at another man again.
FELIX: What the fuck are you doing?!
GORDY: Hey, easy. What's the problem?
FELIX: You're going the wrong goddamn I am?. Looks different in the Turn around!
GORDY: I am?. Looks different in the Turn around!
FELIX: Turn around!
FELIX: You drive where I say. Or the Supervisor will have us both shot.
FELIX: It's afternoon. Yesterday, you said it would only take two more
GORDY: I have this one ready to go.
FELIX: What about the other one?
GORDY: I just need another part from town, and it's five more minutes.
FELIX: . Shit. Fine. Let's go.
FELIX: Why're you bringing the tool box?
GORDY: The old part's in there. I need to match it, and it's all greasy.
GORDY: Berta working today?
FELIX: Ha! Puta!
GORDY: You as thirsty as I am?
FELIX: Felix gets into the Land Cruiser.
GORDY: We can't stop for one beer?
FELIX: There's beer at the plantation.
GORDY: ( thinking fast ) There's no Berta at the plantation. I like drinking beer around pretty girls, not a bunch of guys with automatic rifles.
FELIX: To hell with Berta.
GORDY: What happened? Last night you were in love with her.
FELIX: . I had a dream. I fed her lobster, got her drunk, and she rejected me for another man. Dreams tell the future.
GORDY: . That wasn't a dream, that was the alcohol talking. You saying two men can't go have a beer and look at women's breasts because of pink elephants?. Nothing makes any sense down here.
GORDY: Go ahead and shoot me, and you fix the goddamn generator. Part's in the back.
FELIX: You know I'm your man, baby.
GORDY: I have to piss.
GUERRILLA: Gordy stops. The two standing men walk toward him. The other two men get out of the truck to provide backup. One guerrilla approaching Gordy stops short and stands off, cocked-and-locked, as the other comes up. Gordy carefully produces the travel pass. The guerrilla looks it over. In butchered Spanish
GORDY: Yo trabajo con Felix. Felix la cantina. Con Berta.
FELIX: Are you trying to get us both I went for a walk. I figured you wanted to be alone with Berta.
GORDY: I went for a walk. I figured you wanted to be alone with Berta.
FELIX: ( to the guerrillas; I'll make sure he's on a shorter
FELIX: 214 INT. LAND CRUISER - NIGHT 214
FELIX: You're working all night, Beckmann. That generator gets fixed, and you're out of my hair in the morning.
GORDY: That make you happy?
GORDY: Where's my money?
FELIX: You'll get it in the morning.
GORDY: This where Armstrong stays?
FELIX: This is where you stay. A boat will take you down river at seven.
GORDY: Come on, baby. come on, baby.
GORDY: Just in time.
BEATEN MAN: ( in Spanish ) Organize the others. Find him.
FELIX: ( in Spanish ) He can't be far. You'll catch
BEATEN MAN: ( in Spanish ) Keep looking.
WIDER: Gordy bursts from his hiding place.
GORDY: No! Stop! Alto!
GORDY: Get back!
WOMAN: 255 GUARDS 255

THE WOLF: You want to kill me? Come and kill me.
THE WOLF: You Americans think you have all the answers. And really, you're so naive.
THE WOLF: . You see one peasant with a gun, and you never ask why he has to have it. You just run to give your billions to the nearest soldiers, no matter how merciless or corrupt they are.
THE WOLF: That's why I'm teaching America a lesson. that's why there'll be more bombs. and more families like yours will pay the price.

SELENA: Claudio used to be a teacher. I was a medical aid worker. We met in Guatemala, in an Indian village called Guamaunco. We were married there. Sophia, our daughter was born there. Claudio was kind and loving, and we were happy. We were there four years when the civil war broke out. The guerrillas were all around us, but left us alone. Then they made an attack on the army nearby. The next night, soldiers came to our village. They were led by American 'advisors'. They accused us of helping the rebels. Our women were raped. Our men were tortured. Our homes were burned. We crawled out into the fields, but they threw grenades, and Sophia.
SELENA: . my baby girl was hit by shrapnel. she bled to death in Claudio's arms.
SELENA: Claudio joined the guerrillas. When that war ended, we moved to the next war, and the next. Each fight has only deepened his hatred. And poisoned his soul. He's unable to love anything Why are you still here?
GORDY: Why are you still here?
SELENA: Because I know he was a good man, who's been consumed by rage because of what he lost. Just like you.
GORDY: I'm not like him.
SELENA: Not yet.
GORDY: He kills innocent people. He's planning to kill more.

PHIPPS: That's okay. We'll keep trying.
