BROOKE VO: ( phone filter ) There's never been anyone like you, since you. I love you Vaughn. I love you like no-one else ever has, or could. I'm not going to try to persuade you. Just follow your heart. OK?
VAUGHN: I don't know. I mean I want you, I want to be with you. You know that. It's just . . .
VAUGHN: Can you . . . just give me twenty four hours ­ OK?
BROOKE OS: ( phone filter ) Are you lost? You sound lost.
VAUGHN: Thought I'd try a new way home. Beat the traffic, you know.
BROOKE OS: ( phone filter ) A little girl fell in love with a little boy. Still falling over here!

BROOKE: ( laughter, phone filter ) See ­ even she's on my side! ( beat ) I love you Vaughn. Once upon a time.
VAUGHN: I love you too. I gotta. . . I'll call you ­ OK. Bye baby.
BROOKE OS: ( phone filter ) Another call. Is it her?
VAUGHN: ( hesitant ) ( phone filter )
BROOKE OS: ( phone filter ) I guess you better take it.

VAUGHN: Mia. Hi honey.
MIA OS: ( phone filter ) Mia? Who's she? It's late. Pip wants a goodnight kiss. Where are you? Vaughn?
CUT TO: 1.02 INT. SUBURBAN SEMI ­ DAY Vaughn sits in the conservatory and drinks his morning tea. His gaze out into the garden is broken by something in the cup, in the tea, that gets his attention. Troubled and preoccupied, he frowns as he looks at the tea in the tea cup. His daughter PIP ( 8 ) rushes into the conservatory in her pyjamas and throws herself on him ­ her beloved, wonderful
PIP: Vaughn catches her and tickles her and laughs with her. But his indecision darkens his tired eyes with stress. 1.03 INT. GARDEN SHED ­ DAY Vaughn SAWS wood fastened in a workbench vice. The usual garden shed clutter of garden furnature and bikes around him. There is a tense, manic regularity to his saw strokes. A sound, OS, makes him stop sawing:
BROOK VO: Once upon a time.
VAUGHN: OK. See you later.
CUT TO: 1.04 INT. SUBURBAN SEMI ­ DAY Vaughn pretends to read the paper in the kitchen. The front door opens. The voices of Mia and Pip approach, OS. MIA ( 30s ) enters the kitchen with several shopping bags. She doesn't look at Vaughn. Vaughn watches in a distracted way.
MIA: Pip - you helping me or what?
MIA: ( not looking at Vaughn ) Any more takers? What the fuck is wrong with you?
MIA: Wrong time of the month?
MIA: Don't worry. Seriously.
SUPER: I love you with every fibre. To the end.
MIA: ( still no eye contact ) You out later then darling?
SUPER: Don't do this to me - please?
VAUGHN: Yeah. Probably. I don't know.

SUPER: Do I disgust you that much?
CUT TO: 1.05 INT. SUBURBAN SEMI ­ DAY Vaughn, Mia and Pip sit at the table eating lunch.
PIP: But why not? Daddy said we could. Daddy?
VAUGHN: I'm not sure sweetheart.
BROOK VO: ( seductive whisper ) You promised.
MIA: Daddy's not feeling too well, darling. I'm sure a swim will do us all good.
PIP: Daddy? Please? Mia said you'd. . .
MIA: Mummy. It's mummy! Who's Mia!?
PIP: Mamma Mia! Sure thing, nitwit. Let's give it half an hour to let our lunch go down. I'm fine.
VAUGHN: Sure thing, nitwit. Let's give it half an hour to let our lunch go down. I'm fine.
SUPER: Daddy you are a lying piece of shit.

MIA: Come on. Milkshakes later!

BROOKE: Vaughn Black. Will you come out and play?
BROOKE: Thank you.
BROOKE: Beer, water or tea? The world's your oyster.

VAUGHN: White, one sugar. Thank you.
SUPER: This is going to work. All I want!
BROOKE: My lord.
BROOKE: What you did . . . I mean I appreciate what you've done for me ­ for us. All I can tell you is that it will be worth it. We're meant to be together, V. You've always said that.
VAUGHN: Come on. You don't owe me anything. I made a choice.
BROOKE: I've been waiting to show you.
VAUGHN: My God, Brooke. It's . . . You want to grab a shower. We should go out and celebrate.
BROOKE: You want to grab a shower. We should go out and celebrate.
VAUGHN: You're telling me I stink. Mea
BROOKE: She screams a little, laughs a lot. She buries her nose in his armpits ­ or tries to. They play-fight and kiss. The kiss develops into more. She wants him. They are lost in each other until Vaughn slows them down, pulls back slightly, gently.
VAUGHN: I'll take a shower.
BROOKE: I'll show you. Might even watch you. A man in my shower. The little boy a little girl fell in love with. Once upon a time.
VAUGHN: ( the boy inside ) He's still in there somewhere.
BROOKE: And now . . .

CUT TO: 1.17 EXT. SCHOOL ­ DAY Snow has turned the world into a postcard. With a kiss and a wave, Mia drops Pip off at primary school. She looks like she hasn't slept, but manages to be cheerful.

BROOKE: Got something for you lover-boy.

VAUGHN: How is she?
SUPER: My family is my world. Forgive me.
MIA: Don't start, Vaughn. What kind of a fucking stupid question is that? How's my daughter now that I've walked out on her and her mother and run into the arms of my childhood
MIA: Jesus ­ the false caller IDs on your phone. `Office'? I mean please. And remember eye contact? You should try private browsing ­ or at least clear your history every now and again. For someone who's in fucking IT . . . So what now? You want some clothes, your tool box, the toaster: a divorce?
MIA: Have them all. On the house.
MIA: Now fuck off, please? It's over. You piece of shit . . .

VAUGHN: Babe? ( nothing, so ) Brooke?
BROOKE: She laughs and runs toward him, but he isn't impressed.
BROOKE: What's wrong?
VAUGHN: What d'you think? Were you always this stupid?
SUPER: What d'you think? Were you always this stupid?
BROOKE: Blimey ­ someone lost their sense of humour.
BROOKE: I thought you'd be pleased for me. I got a job!
VAUGHN: That's brilliant. When?
SUPER: I don't care anymore.
BROOKE: Start on Monday. It'll be good for us ­ we can be DINKYs.
SUPER: I beg you with all my life.
VAUGHN: It's great ­ really.
SUPER: Forgive me ­ I want only that.
BROOKE: You're hungry. Thirsty? Let me get you a drink. Drink for my king. Then maybe . . .
SCREAM: Vaughn pulls back from her, looks at her. Her terror.
VAUGHN: Tell me! For God sake . . .
VAUGHN: Who did this to you?
BROOKE: Does it matter? He was jealous. He's everything you're not. Vaughn? You love me. Baby? You don't need to fear him. They're just scars. Oh God, no. Vaughn? They're just scars for God sake. This is my body!

CY: Cy walks way ahead of Mo. The hell out of here.
MO: Wait ­ I gotta sign you out man. Paperwork. You got the forms?
CY: Man? What the hell happened to `sir'?
MO: Sir? You're a knight? The queen dub you or something? If I don't call you sir that doesn't mean I don't respect. It just means I don't call you sir.

CY: OK. What the fuck is the matter with all this? I've got my thing, now I just want to get out of here. Let's sign the papers ­ and I can't quite believe there are papers ­ and I'm done. Clear?
MO: Clear. So what's on the ( the VHS ) video?
CY: Jesus. Mind my business is on the video. Is that all right?
MO: It's fine, bro; but hostility ain't working. Not in here.
MO: It was that show - that play you were directing. Silver something. Shit. Four, five years back. Come on, man ­ you must remember.
CY: OK. I remember. So can we go now?
MO: Sure, but look: what's with all the storage. You moving house or something?

MO: I know your true potential. I know your talent doesn't belong packed up in here. Your greatness. And you've failed.
CY: What are you doing?
MO: You don't think I know how you feel. I feel it. In here. I feel failure in here every day and every fourth Sunday. I feel like brilliance left to rot, too. That's how you feel ­ no? You feel it when it wakes you to tap on your shoulder and say `this is what you could have been, this is what you are' Storage boxes? What happened?
CY: ( shocked )
MO: You're sorry for yourself. That's in your face.
CY: This is fucking absurd. ( of his broken phone ) Criminal damage. Threatening behaviour.
MO: Cy ­ we're done here, seriously. Then I'll sign you out. You can ask about the mobile phone you dropped; but I doubt you can claim it on us. Just tell me why you're all stored up in here. Then . . .
CY: Mo, isn't it? What does that mean ­ `Mo'? In any event I can promise you repercussions. I don't care what you think of me. I won't be treated like this. Brave Mister Caudwell. Genius. Solid citizen I don't think. Just need to know what you're doing. Then that's the end of it all. My landlord asked me to move out.
MO: Brave Mister Caudwell. Genius. Solid citizen I don't think. Just need to know what you're doing. Then that's the end of it all. My landlord asked me to move out.

MO: Couldn't pay your rent. Why don't you just say that. I couldn't pay my rent, Mo. That's fine. It's called la crunch du credit. And here we are.
MO: We're almost, nearly, seriously out of here, Mister Caudwell.
MO: On timers ­ saves power. You must know. Auto-ma-tic.
MO: Time to go home, Cy. My only ask is this. And you don't have to say yes, say anything. All I ask is we do it again.
MO: ( strange laugh ) I know. I know it sounds strange. Bit silly even. But if you just let me run the thing again, this time I'll nail it ­ swear.
MO: ( of the VHS in Cy's hand ) I mean. On a fucking VHS video cassette. Where's Noah when you need him?
MO: Let's run this again from the top, Cy.

CY: What the fuck, sunshine. Equity subscriptions lapsing are they?
MO: Cy, seriously, man who directed nothing: let's just get this right. Then we can get on with things. You can go back your self-loathing and I can continue my rounds.
CY: What!? Screw you. ( loud, to anyone again for help ) FUCK YOU!
CY: What the fuck is the matter with you? Jesus Christ!
MO: Jesus not in here, bro. Christ a nipple sucked by mugs. One born every minute, tick tock.
MO: OK. So what's the brief?
CY: What's the scenario? Set the scene for me. Point me in the right direction. Even Brando needed goalposts.
MO: What's the scenario? Set the scene for me. Point me in the right direction. Even Brando needed goalposts.
CY: Help. HELP!
MO: No sweat, Doll. Just relax. This place is damn big. And you're talking to the big expert here. ( shows Cy his shoes ) Gotta do a circuit every hour. ( beat ) We gonna just do this thing, then it's home free. OK? Relax.

MO: Well not really Mister De Mille. It's just me and Doll today. Cutbacks. Don't ya love them?
MO: Set me straight, mister director!
MO: The director's chair.
CY: What the fuck do you want?
MO: You know what I want. Just like you: another chance. Audition me again, you fucking VHS crumb. Give me my brief. Motivation, reality ­ the whole bit. Go.
CY: Do what you want, wanker.
CY: You'll do time. Fucking acting. You'll go down. I'll see to it. Think you can fucking do this.
MO: Again. The scenario, please Cy. Who am I? What do I want?
CY: OK crackerjack. Let's play. You're a fucked up wannabe actor who never was and never will be who works as a security guard in a domestic storage depot. Like most people you can't handle rejection, but I mean you really can't handle it ­ really I mean. It's just . . .
MO: Good dog. Now. . .
MO: That wasn't the character I read for, the last one I mean. My agent told me a soccer player who is afraid to tell his team- mates of his homosexuality. He turns to his manager for help, for answers to his dilemma; but in the face of this, of this outrage, the manager who has been like a surrogate father to him for years now turns against him, disgusted that the boy he believed in turned out to be a lamentable sausage jockey. Am I right?
MO: I'm right, man. That was the scenario wasn't it. The Silver thing I auditioned for that you turned me down for. Wrong. Ignored me for. Like the loser I was. Wrong. The winner is here. In front of you. So. . .
MO: Make like a camera.
MO: It's hard for Cy to make the sound of a camera rolling.
MO: Without a script this time, note. Ad-libbing, free wheeling improvisazione, herr director!
MO: ( in character ) All my life. Imagine living a lie ­ forever. Not just the lies everybody lives day to day to get by, play the game; but one big lie that stretches from beginning to end: a truth so hideous that it could be called ordinary. A verity of the genes, of psychology. And then imagine the one person the liar could turn to turning away, so that the liar was left with nothing but the lie. Imagine exploding with the desire to be what you are, to be real, and to be accepted for what you are, perhaps even loved. Not loved with money for playing games, but loved with respect for having the strength to stand apart. Imagine that. But the works of the imagination must cede to that we call reality. And here we are, you choosing the side of the mob and me left outside in the cold. Well I've got news for you, turncoat: I don't fucking care. I've got the future. TTFN, blood. TT forever.
MO: Cy. Director. Really.
MO: So, how was I? How was it?
CY: You did it. You got the job.
MO: Mo starts to beat Cy gain, but this time he kicks him too. He goes berserk, throwing Cy around like a rag doll, pulping him.
LIAR!: Mo starts to beat Cy gain, but this time he kicks him too. He goes berserk, throwing Cy around like a rag doll, pulping him.

He does this often, by habit. He gets a text. He checks the message. Doesn't reply. A police car cruises. Jaden doesn't react to it, but he does so in a way that suggests that this is a measured response. He grabs his phone, hits some keys. Someone picks up.

A BMW: Swerves near him, splashing him with headlights. Jaden looks, sees faces he doesn't want to see. He speeds up and then runs down a side street. The BMW follows. Now Jaden Runs, runs, runs This is our first scene over again. The streets blur around him into a narrative of his life: the urban landscape dancing to the beat of his feet. But Jaden wasn't born to run. Dodging up an alley he slows, turns. The BMW doors open. Three men get out, follow him. The glint and sound of shanks being drawn, ready. Breathing hard but measured, Paul turns and faces them: a big black guy, an ugly white guy and a tall Chinese guy. Jaden feels the bulge in his belt at the base of his spine.

THE GUN: Sits there ­ sleek and cool and mighty and everything. Slowly, daring himself, Austen goes to TOUCH IT. His fingers linger on the smooth, cool, imperious steel. Austen is a God.

LINDEN: Go fuckin' my brah's enemy, ho. My blood's white white enemy. For you he's dead. Fuckin' . . .
CUT TO: 3.81 EXT. E3 ­ NIGHT Jaden sprints flat out through the people, cars, and lights. He rounds a corner in time to see Linden's car smoke away.

COP: ( to Paul ) COP ( cont'd )
JADEN: Why you fuckin' grass me up. Though you was my brah.
AUSTEN: I didn't tell the pigs. Just ( falters, then ) . . . just Hugo up school.
AUSTEN: Told because I was proud of ya brah. Massive proud.
AUSTEN: Couldn't help it.
AUSTEN: What the pigs gonna do with ya?
JADEN: Where the fuck . . ?
AUSTEN: Only way you're gonna stop me turning into you is by killing me, brah. Long one short.
AUSTEN: Say what brah? Too much . . .
JADEN: ( a mumble )
AUSTEN VO: ( Jaden's memory ) Only way you're gonna stop me turning into you is by killing me, brah.
JADEN: Got a better idea, baby blood.
HOMEWORK: SNAP CUT TO BLACK 56 | P a g e
BLACK: `Mea Culpa'
SUPER: `Mea Culpa'
WIFE: Won't be long.
URI VO: But now the buck must stop. Exculpation is no longer an option. The state has lied to you, Mrs Pentane, and whatever the consequences, I feel it my duty to put the record straight. Why I feel thus obliged will become apparent should we meet. I leave that up to you.
THUG#2: Get some deep heat on it.
URI: ( frustrated )
PUNCHES: NICHOLAS ( 30s ) ­ a man tied naked to an old chair. Nicholas is a mass of cuts, sores, burns and untreated wounds. He is filthy and unshaven. He is delirious with agony. Nicholas barely reacts to the blow ­ he's too far gone.
URI: ( without looking up from his book ) Nicholas it's really so very
URI: Alright, alright ­ thank you Mister Karaczun. This is . . .
UP ON: 4.94 INT. RESEARCH ROOM, FACILITY ­ DAY Uri stands back. There is blood all over his rubber gloves and some on his apron. He looks at Nicholas, feels his pulse. Nicholas is dead.
BOOTHY: Has the next of kin been
SILK: Not yet sir.
BOOTHY: ( inform her )
SILK: Yes sir.
URI: Our intelligence . . .
BOOTHY: As the board understood it, the prisoner was verified as the jihadi. There was DNA. . .
URI: We now believe the evidenced might have been contaminated.
BOOTHY: ( not impressed ) Was there any form of extraction?
URI: The suspect revealed nothing of the activities of which he was suspected by the board, sir.
PARKER: Fruit was not born.
URI: It was a fruitless interrogation, sir - yes.
BOOTHY: So not only do we have no further intel about the event, we have another next of kin, a nuclear bloody winter of media fallout and the inevitable Whitehall storm. We also have another body to . . .
PARKER: Liquidate, sir?
BOOTHY: ( refers to laptop ) It says here `The suspect did not respond to the usual stimuli. ( at Uri ) Stimuli? The usual . . .
URI: We explored the usual routes in accordance with our mandate.
SILK: ( to Boothy )
URI: That's likely, yes.
BOOTHY: Likely? Christ! This is the kind of thing the media gorges on for months! We can't . . .
URI: There is no need.
URI: Nicholas Pentane died while engaged in activities commensal with his profession as a freelance reporter from wounds sustained at the hands of insurgent personnel. He died behind enemy lines. He was transported home in a manner befitting a hero. He died while attempting to maintain the integrity and vibrancy of a free press ­ a press we all. . .
BOOTHY: Spare me the party line, Uri, for God sake! This'll wiki itself sky high unless . . .
URI: It's taken care of, sir.
BOOTHY: We're getting off-message here.
PARKER: Mission creep.
BOOTHY: What we're here to establish is how a freelance writer get's wrongly arrested, subjected to ( makes quotation marks with his fingers ) rendition and is then tortured by experts in the certainty that he is in fact a terrorist planning acts against the common good. On home soil against the Great British public et cetera. ( beat ) He was as innocent as any of us. Any answers, Uri?
URI: Mistakes, happen, sir.
BOOTHY: The man wrote a column for the Economist, for God sake!
URI: The best moles have the best covers, sir. They simply always do.
BOOTHY: What we also need to establish is whether he was killed deliberately, or by . . .
PARKER: Misadventure, sir?
URI: The human body can only take so much, sir. Subjected to a certain level of pressure it buckles. Nicholas Pentane's body simply broke under duress.
SILK: The mind-body continuum.
URI: The mind-body continuum.
BOOTHY: NP was arrested on the night of the fourth ( reads more then ) Transported under guard to the facility. Work began on the seventh to determine. . .
BOOTHY: So what was going on between the fourth and the seventh?
URI: I was on holiday, sir.
SILK: Ah. Anywhere nice?
URI: Malaga again, sir. My wife does like it there.
BOOTHY: Well not a bad choice at that time of year. We recommended that to do didn't we?
URI: You did, sir, yes. Your wife actually sent us the brochure if you recall.
ELLE: Hello. ( then, disappointed ) Yes. ( then, with dread ) Yes.
BOOTHY VO: We actually tried Corfu this year. Not bad ­ though it could have been warmer.
SILK VO: I can actually recommend Crete at this time of year. A bit populous, but there are places where one can escape the hordes.
BOOTHY: Oh Lord, Michael; if we left it to you we'll all be holidaying on the Norfolk Broads!
BOOTHY: What we're left with is something of a mess. I'm sure you agree.
URI: Sorry sir I don't suppose we could get some . . . I'm . . .
BOOTHY: ( into the intercom ) Sharon could we get some more coffee please. ( to the others ) Biscuits? ( the others nod except Uri ) And some biscuits. The usual. Actually if there are any chocolate digestives.
SHARON OS: ( on the intercom ) Certainly sir.
BOOTHY: ( into the intercom ) Thanks Sharon.
URI: My desire to meet with you arises from a strong urge to inform you of the circumstances under which your husband actually passed away. The fact is, Mrs Pentane, that you have certainly been misinformed.
BOOTHY: Thanks Sharon.
PARKER: ( mouth full ) ( to Parker )
BOOTHY: ( to Parker )
URI: Bloody hell!
BUZZER: 4.106 INT. ELLE'S APARTMENT ­ DAY, SAME TIME Elle hears the door buzzer. She is pale and underweight. She gets up, walks to the apartment door. She presses the intercom button with trepidation. Her mouth is dry.
ELLE: The crackle of electric silence. Nothing. 67 | P a g e Exasperated, she takes her finger off the button, turns away. The buzzer sounds again. Elle curses and turns back to it. She hesitates, and then presses the answer button.
ELLE: Mrs Pentane? It's Uri Tallow from the ministry. We spoke
URI: Mrs Pentane? It's Uri Tallow from the ministry. We spoke
ELLE: Ah ­ yes. Come in.
KNOCK: On her door makes her jump. She gathers herself. She goes to the door. Eventually she opens it. Uri stands there. He smiles thinly, extends a hand. As she takes it he looks at his hand. This hand killed her love.
URI: Mrs Pentane very good of you to see me like this.
ELLE: Come in Mister Tallow.
URI: Lovely, just lovely. This is yours? Goodness.
URI: It's amazing. Such talent. Me . . .
ELLE: Can I get you anything?
URI: No ­ really I'm fine. Thank you.
URI: Such platitudes! Here we are trapped inside a Terrence Rattigan three act . . .
URI: Mrs Pentane. A delicate subject of course. Your husband.
URI: Good, old fashioned paper. Nothing like it.
URI: Firstly I'm so very sorry for your loss. I know the ministry has informed you that your husband ­ Mr Nicholas . . .
URI: Misses Pentane the fact is that . . .
URI: The truth is Misses Pentane that . . . I'm here to tell you that . . . Well this may not be what you want to hear but . . .
ELLE: ( get the fuck out ) If you'd kindly hurry. Please.
URI: Misses Pentane I . . .
URI: Misses Pentane . . .
ELLE: Oh for God sake!
URI: The fact is that your husband did not die in the manner in which you have been told he died. As I alluded in my letter, my email. . .
ELLE: I can't do this now. I'm sorry.
URI: Misses Pentane please hear me. Why did I come here today? Well, the truth is I believe you should have the facts. The facts are that. . .we believe your husband was wrongfully arrested and . . .
ELLE: You need to get the hell away from me. Sorry, but. . .
URI: Misses Pentane the fact is that your husband was subjected to rendition. Not as you may have heard of it but in a form. . .
URI: Whilst in this instance your husband wasn't transported abroad because of logistics.
ELLE: ( a whisper )
URI: He was subjected here, in the United Kingdom to a process designed to get him to confess.
BOOTHY: What we need to establish, Uri, is whether, having found out that you had made a mistake, you killed Nicholas Pentane deliberately, or whether his death was merely a product of of the processes to which he was being subjected.
URI: He was no longer any use. By that stage his body was, his mind. . .He would never have been able to lead an ordinary life: work, have relationships.
BOOTHY: So you did the judicious thing and disposed of the suspect
URI: Your husband was tortured, Misses Pentane.
URI: These are measures taken occasionally and in conditions of the utmost secrecy against certain suspects accused of terrorism ­ I'm sure you're aware.
ELLE: DON'T TOUCH ME!
ELLE: Get out. Now.
URI: This isn't exactly what I came here to tell you, Misses . . . Not entirely. . .
URI: What I came here to tell you today that it was me. I oversaw the torture and tortured your husband. It was under my ministrations . . .
URI: It was me, you see. I killed him. An accident. Only so much.
URI: I know this is a lot to take in, Misses Pentane.
ELLE: What are you?
ELLE: I'm calling the police.
URI: That won't help much today.
ELLE: What the fuck do you think. . . Get out ­ now!
ELLE: Fucker! GET THE FUCK OUT!
ELLE: What do you want from me?
URI: I want. I want. . .
URI: Wait. Wait please.
URI: But she has swung and CONNECTED before he has spoken. He reels from the impact, but she is weak with shock.
ELLE: Piece of shit-mould. Get out. . .
ELLE: This is what you fucking want? Fuck. . .( sobbing ) Oh Jesus. . .
HITS: Him with it. That sends him flying. He grovels on the carpet. 74 | P a g e
ELLE: Motherfucker . . .
URI: Yes ( blow ) Yes ( blow ) Yes ( blow ).
ELLE: Piece of dogshit . . .
URI: Misses Pentane . . . the exertion. Please . . .
ELLE: What? ( incredulous ) WHAT?
URI: I relieved him of his pain.
ELLE: Am I expected to admire . . . Leave me alone.
URI: It's OK. I don't want you to be . . . I'll make up a story. Don't worry. ( beat ) Actually I hate it all. ( beat ) I do as I'm told, actually. Sometimes . . .
CONNECTS: Uri is thrown sideways by the adrenal force of the blow. He falls on the expensive carpet, barely conscious. He glimpses a WHITE feather displayed as an ornament among other artefacts in a lit, glass fronted display cabinet. Elle drops the stone statue again, stumbles away.
ELLE: Get out.
URI: Don't worry. Mum's the word, Mrs Pentane. I'll take care of everything. Everything. I promise. . .
CUT TO: 4.111 INT. FACILITY ­ DAY His face scarred, Uri sits among the instruments of torture. Done thinking, he suddenly snaps his rubber gloves on. Better get to it. 76 | P a g e
BLACK: `Jeremy Bentham'
SUPER: `Jeremy Bentham'
AD VO: . . .not that you'll be needing one now that your house assurance is on the house. Cheers!
MARLOW VO: My sense of it is, Christie, as I've said, and the reason I feel I failed, really, is that the state must find a way to take responsibility.
MARLOW VO: Well I don't know about that. But yes, I'm looking to move out of the legal profession now.
MARLOW: I know. But look. For me it's this: we send her out to Afghanistan. We tell her to kill people who resisted our invasion. ( as the DJ starts to speak ) But anyway ­ look: we make her an expert. A killing machine. And then war breaks our machine. So then our machine needs Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder drugs in order to function in normal life. To make a cup of tea, for God sake. ( silence a beat, then ) She's a broken child, Chrissie. We broke her. So then when she kills a known psychotic child molester and murderer in her home in the middle of the night ­ in her home - in self-defence ­ we, the state, we call that murder, and we throw her to the dogs. We screw her up in the name of a cause in some country some people - and lets' face it, in a part of the world not many British people know or give a damn about - and then we finish the job. We prosecute her for murder and lock her up.
MARLOW VO: I understand. I understand that when you sign up, you take your chances. You become an organ of the state, and if that state tells you to kill people in its name, it chooses not to call that murder. It chooses then to call you a hero ­ especially if you die.
MARLOW VO: Nation states have always protected themselves from their own imperial absurdities. What would be left if there was no chance of glory? Why would anyone sign up? Look: in war, anywhere, people do what they can to survive. All I can say is that personally, I mean as Shona's brief, I failed to make the court see sense. For me, you know, it's like you can murder in the so called defence of the state but if you kill in the defence of yourself . . .You know it's like, I mean as Shakespeare said `if his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us.'
CUT TO: 5.114 INT. SHONA'S HOME, BEDROOM ­ NIGHT SHONA ( 20s, black ) is awoken by a sound ­ the dull clunk of something giving under strain. She lifts her head up, listens. Another clunk, but this followed by other sounds downstairs. Shona is quickly out of bed, standing. She moves in a way that suggests combat training: with controlled power and assurance. She is not afraid.
CRACK: A fist connects with his jaw, sending him staggering.
CRACK, CRACK: Another two blows ­ a fist and a kick. Caleb sprawls, and then manages to stand as Shona attacks him. She moves fast and with focus ­ a shape in the darkness moving very fast. Caleb lashes out with his right fist. He misses. She lands another two punches to his neck and face. He yells and lashes out again. This time he connects with the side of her head. She goes sprawling. He dives towards her and pounds her with his fists.
CALEB: What the fuck ­ easy-peasy, ho!
CALEB: A bitch. I been had by a bitch! ( starts to laugh ) Stand, bitch.
CALEB: I said stand up. No way we're gonna have chats with you sprawled. Less you wanna fuck me now that is.
CALEB: Well shocky-shocky-shock. Wasn't expecting quite such a welcome.
CALEB: What the fuck.
CALEB: It's Christmas, ho, ho, ho . . .
CALEB: Way ­ ho. Choice. Smile for the camera. You got names?
CALEB: All fucked up now ain't ya, babe. Who did this to ya?
CALEB: Notable: Lara fuckety Croft.
CALEB: ( game over )
LASHES OUT: He goes to hit her in the face with his gun but she ducks. He swings at her again, and again she ducks. She assumes a combat position: fists up, body ready again. She looks at his eyes.
CALEB: Well ain't you the pocket battleship. We gonna have another swingers, you an' me? Don't think so, bitch. Think you an' me we gonna have chats, get under each other's skinny, maybe get some cosy. Howzat.
CALEB: OK. Let's play the you-kneeling -on-the-floor-now game. I liked you down there. Yesterday, bitch.
SHOOTS HER: The bullet NICKS shoulder. It's just a flesh wound ­ but enough to shut her up and make her drop to her knees in AGONY.
CALEB: Now we got some kind of understanding. Some kind of parity goin' down. Name, ho.
CALEB: Well well. Now I'm more than somewhat. Don't know that I could take one like that.
CALEB: Well that explains. A bona fide fuckin hero. Heroine. Which makes me wonder, actually: where's your stash? The gear?
CALEB: Don't make me spell it out. You know why we in `ere `aving this.
CALEB: DON'T PLAY ME, BITCH. Where's your fuckin' gear. Everybody got gear round this green and pleasant land.
CALEB: What the fuck. You the only bitch I picked in this whole postie with no gear? Fuck. Trust Caleb to pick a soldier.
CALEB: You got that uniform still? I like a woman in uniform.
CALEB: How come you so hot, babes? You leave the central heating on all night to keep you snuggles? Nothing like a man for that.
CALEB: Hey ­ what you lookin' at? Look at me. At me eyes, ho.
CALEB: I said look at me you fuckin' . . .
CALEB: You know what I am ­ huh? You know what I am, really? ( leans close, looks deep into her eyes ) I'm hungry. Starved. ( stands up, moves towards the door ) Wot you gonna give Caleb tweet ­ apart from laters?
CALEB: Hey ­ no: none of that. You stay front and fucking centre. On the ball. Keep your soldier eyes on me no matter what. Hear me?
CALEB: That's better, soldier soldier. Now don't be going for no walkies ­ `kay?
CALEB: Not a muscle, ho. You stay like a good doggie ­ period.
CALEB: Not a move, babes. I'm watching. Where you keep the cake, ho? Me and Victoria sponge, we're tight as a schoolgirl's twat.
CALEB: ( a low whistle ) And I thought I was fucked up. What they do to you out there, babes? Turn you into a raghead?
CALEB: Hey ­ fuck, bitch. Hey!
SHOOTS: The bullet THUDS into the wall by her as she sprints onto the
CALEB: Come here you fuckin' slag . . .
DOWNSTAIRS: Shona sprints full speed into the
CUTTING HIM: Caleb staggers backwards, his face pouring blood.
CALEB: Fucking slippery bitch! SHIT!
CALEB: You stupid fucking slut! Jesus!
SHONA: Do it.
CALEB: She speaks.
SHONA: Go for it. Serious.
CALEB: Don't fuckin' tempt me.
TRIGGER: Tighter and tighter. The trigger starts to move. But then she
CALEB: What the fuck? No one smiles at Caleb.
CALEB: Stop. ( spells ) D-O-N-T. I said. . .
CALEB: ( panicked )
CALEB: Your choice, bitch.
SHONA: She drops her guard, stands very still, waiting. The bleeding gunshot wound in her shoulder is draining the life from her. They look at each other a moment, breathing hard. She looks away from him, disgusted. 88 | P a g e
CALEB: That's what I thought. ( beat ) OK. So now what we gonna do is you gonna make me a sarnie. Go.
CALEB: Solider girl needs a hospital.
CALEB: So what's with all the shit? ( indicates the cupboard with the drugs in it ) They fuck you up in ragland or something? Wonder why you can't lead a normal fuckin' life? Wankers. You do what they tell ya an' you're all cool, babes. Do what you wanna do an' you're . . . ( pulls his finger across his throat ) You decorated and all that? I should be scared. ( laughs ) If you just knew what Caleb has done. Bad things, babes, worse than bad. Then you'd be scared, trust.
SHONA: What do you want?
CALEB: What you think I fuckin' want? A teensy weensy respect would be nice. Failing that, this sarnie is really rather nice, ta.
SHONA: ( strangely calm ) I need a doctor.
CALEB: She needs a doctor. Well you might yet, babes. We not done partying yet. Then maybe you need a doctor. First. . .
CALEB: First I'm going to see what's what ( indicates the house, her possession ). Then we gonna see what's what ( looks at her body suggestively ). Ain't never done black, but there's always a first time ­ no? Say there's no goin' back. That right?
CALEB: You wan' it first, or you wanna sit tight while I go foray, then we get acquainted?
CALEB: Oh for fuck's sake.
CALEB: What do ya need?
CALEB: Get fixed up, babes, I ain't got all night.
CALEB: She swallows. He knew she would.
SHONA: You have to go now.
CALEB: Fuckin' what? ( laughs ) Fuckin' what? I'll leave when it's time to leave, babes. First is you gonna show me some hospitable time ­ just the two of us. The shit ( her belongings ) can wait.
CALEB: Babes ­ come on. We can be fuck buddies or whatever.
SHONA: Friends with benefits. Yeah.
CALEB: Friends with benefits. Gotcha. You watch all the right shows. No strings, no comebacks. So the things is: however we do it, Caleb's getting' horny, so . . .
CALEB: Slow and steady wins the race, babes. We take it easy steps. That's right ­ beautiful. . .
SHONA: Get the fuck out of my house.
CALEB: Say what?
CALEB: An' me been so fuckin' la-de- dah with ya, and now this. Do what Caleb says, bitch, an' do it NOW . . .
CALEB: Sit the fuck . . .
FIRES: His gun wildly up at her ­ anywhere. Succumbing to the drugs she dodges as the bullets THUD into the walls and furnature.
SHONA: Stop! Please . . .
