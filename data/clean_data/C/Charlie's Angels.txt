EARLY DRAFT: August 11, 1999
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: I'm sorry, sir. This cabin is restricted to first cl.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Oh, I'm sorry. Please. Is there anything I can get you?
PASQUAL: ( tentatively ) They say birds can't fly this high.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Shall I pour your scotch?
PASQUAL: Be careful with it, huh?
PASQUAL: Well, what're you gonna do?
PASQUAL: That's very funny.
PASQUAL: Suddenly WHOMMPPPH!! the skydiver spread-eagles, stopping the wild dive directly behind Pasqual, and immediately binds his arms and straps a parachute on him. All three are still free-falling. James Earl Jones nods at the Skydiver who, even under the helmet and goggles, is clearly a beautiful woman. Meet ALEXANDRA "ALEX" MUNDAY, one of Charlie's Angels. She's a sultry bombshell a classic femme fatale only she's playing for the good guys. She gives James Earl Jones a wink, then jerks Pasqual's rip cord and WHOOMPH. Pasqual's chute deploys. He flies upward, leaving Alex and James Earl Jones, both still falling. Below the ocean screams up at them. Not much time left. James Earl Jones pulls his belt and his mufti flies up. It's actually a tiny drogue chute, deploying his entire dashiki. His outfit hides a parachute rig. Alex pulls her own rip cord and WHOOMPH her chute unfurls, and now. Alex and James Earl Jones gently float towards
WHAT?: Suddenly WHOMMPPPH!! the skydiver spread-eagles, stopping the wild dive directly behind Pasqual, and immediately binds his arms and straps a parachute on him. All three are still free-falling.

Alex and James Earl Jones gently float towards
PASQUAL: You crazy bastard!
DYLAN: ( still with James Earl Jones' voice ) Don't need this anymore.
BOSLEY: Well, Angels, the experimental explosives are back in the hands of the government, and the free world can breathe just a lit-tle bit easier tonight, thanks to you three.
NATALIE: And thanks to you, too, Bos.
ALEX: We couldn't have redirected the flight path without your help.
BOSLEY: Nothing a little teamwork can't do. At least, that's what Charlie's always telling us, right ladies?
DYLAN: Charlie will be joining us, won't he?
BOSLEY: He sends his regrets. But he wanted you to know that dinner is on him, so feel free to celebrate.
ALEX: If it's on Charlie, we will.
TRIPTYCH CONTINUES: They're all WOMEN now, in their early twenties. NATALIE, a research fellow at MIT ( and beautiful, but not flaunting it ) demonstrates a chess-playing computer program to a room of impressed advisors. ALEX, valedictorian at Oxford, passionately delivers her address to a crowd of rapt students, faculty and parents. DYLAN, in leather and a helmet, steps off a Harley. She sees a punk with a mohawk slapping around his girlfriend. She decks him, then enters the back door of a seedy punk bar.
TRIPTYCH ENDS: With photographs again. The women, as they are now: Natalie, Alex, Dylan. All gorgeous, all self-assured.
"CHARLIE'S ANGELS": .And a new title sequence takes over:
DYLAN: ( recognizing voice ) Hi. Okay. I'll be right in.
THE VOICE: 'Morning starfish.
DYLAN: Oh God no.
CHAD: EXT. CHAD'S CRAPPY BOAT - DAY Blinded by the daylight, Dylan emerges from below, relieved to see the boat is docked. Chad follows her outside, pleading.
CHAD: C'mon Dylan. You + Me. It's
DYLAN: It's a mistake. A horrible, horrible mistake.
CHAD: Then how come we keep getting back together? It's fate.
CHAD: ( yelling after ) Is it because I live on a boat?
JASON: Get off my back, Sanchez. I know what I'm doing.
ALEX: Which wire? The red one or the blue one?
JASON: Marix has a thing for red. Red cars, red boats, red-headed hookers.
ALEX: So the red one.
JASON: That's why I'm gonna say blue.
ALEX: You saved the world again, Logan.
JASON: That's my job.
ALEX: Let's have it rewritten.
JASON: So when you coming back?
ALEX: Not sure. Whenever I can. I'll call you.
JASON: Oh, great, that's helpful. I don't get it, what kind of executive assistant is on 24 hour call?
ALEX: A very good one.
JASON: You ask me, your boss is an asshole. When do I get to meet this Charlie guy, anyway?
ALEX: Charlie's not very social.
JASON: Yeah, well I think you should Charlie needs me.
ALEX: Charlie needs me.
JASON: I need you.
JASON: I gotta go save the world.
ALEX: My hero.
BOB: ( freaked ) What! Natalie, what?
NATALIE: I thought you were dead.
NATALIE: I thought the police might be here. Or your neighbors. Or your parents, here to identify your remains.
THE BATHROOM,: where she retrieves a toothbrush.
BOB: I'm not.
NATALIE: ( answering phone ) Hello. Absolutely. I'll be right in.
BOB: I'm not dead.
NATALIE: But you can understand why I thought so. You missed our date last night. You didn't call or anything. I was just sitting there by myself.
BOB: I can explain.
BLONDE: ( to Natalie ) I can explain.
BOB: ( to Natalie ) I can explain.
ISAAC HAYES: Beyond weirded out, Natalie just leaves.
BOB: Beyond weirded out, Natalie just leaves.
NATALIE: Just once, I want to date a normal man, without a wife, or a drug addiction, or bondage issues.
DYLAN: Here here.
ALEX: What? I've got a great relationship.
DYLAN: Your boyfriend thinks you're a That way, he doesn't ask about my work.
ALEX: That way, he doesn't ask about my work.
NATALIE: I'm sorry, Bosley. I only made enough for three.
BOSLEY: No, that's.That's okay.
CHARLIE'S VOICE: Good morning, Angels.
ANGELS: ( sing-songy ) Good morning, Charlie.
CHARLIE'S VOICE: I'm sorry to call you back from vacation, but we've got a case that just can't wait.
NATALIE: He's cute.
BOSLEY: He is.
CHARLIE'S VOICE: He's 28-years old, and in three days he'll be a billionaire, when his company, Knox Technologies, goes public.
DYLAN: It's good to be him.
ALEX: So what's the catch?
CHARLIE'S VOICE: Last night, Knox was kidnapped from his own office.
NATALIE: Any ransom?
CHARLIE'S VOICE: No one's heard a thing from the They don't want money. They just want to sink our company.
CHARLIE'S VOICE: Angels, meet Vivian Wu, vice president of finance for Knox Technologies. She's hired us to find Knox.
VIVIAN WU: ( entering ) The initial public offering is in three days. If we don't get Mr. Knox back, or if word gets out that he's missing, the company stands to lose a billion dollars.
ALEX: Charlie, where do we start?
CHARLIE'S VOICE: Alex, I want you and Bosley to stake out Roger Corwin.
ALEX: Kidnap the founder and you sink the company.
CHARLIE'S VOICE: Exactly, Alex. Let's keep our eyes on Mr. Corwin, Angels. If Knox is still alive, Corwin might lead us to him.
DYLAN: We're on it.
NATALIE: Any chance you can join us,
CHARLIE'S POV: We see his chalky fingers grabbing into a hand hold. We're halfway up the face of Yosemite's El Capitan the ground is hundreds of feet below.
ALEX: This is a transmitter. I'll be able to hear everything you say.
BOSLEY: Where do I hide it? I'll be nude.
ALEX: Try to get Corwin to talk about the industry, Knox, anything.
BOSLEY: She points him in the direction of the men's spa. But he's frozen with excitement.
ALEX: I know. You'll do great.
BOSLEY: Hot in here, isn't it?
CORWIN: Computers. Software.
BOSLEY: Computers, hunh? What do you know about this new browser from Knox
CORWIN: I don't see that happening.
BOSLEY: Really? Why not?
THE TRANSMITTER: which BLEEPS. Corwin and others look over. What the hell was that? The device still in his mouth, Bosley has no choice but to smile and swallow. His eyes go wide as he chokes it down. Corwin gets up to leave.
MASSEUSE: ( German accent ) Please to take off clothes, Mr. Corvin.
ALEX: You're carrying a lot of tension along ze fourth und fifth vertebrae. Let me see if I can vork it out.
ALEX: You must have dozed off.
NATALIE: Can you not drive my car so fast, Dyl? I'm trying to type.
DYLAN: ( to Alex, under her breath ) I drive too fast. Look who's talking.
NATALIE: Here's Corwin's itinerary.
DYLAN: Alright, we'll hit the reception tonight. I only wish we had a clue to go on.
NATALIE: Hold that thought.
DYLAN: Natalie licks the shake off her fingers, tapes away at the keyboard.
NATALIE: Check this out. New program I just got from a friend in the Bureau. We take that footage from the kidnapping.
DYLAN: Sweet. Now we've got someone to look for.
ALEX: Oh yeah. He'll be easy to spot with that open head wound.
DYLAN: The average investor sees technology stocks as discrete entities, "This one is up 50 points, this one is down 10." It's only through derivative analysis that one sees the real power of that sector.
BROKER GUY: Which analysis method do you prefer?
DYLAN: Well, there are so many options. I mean, who can say what the one best choice is?
NATALIE: BACK WITH DYLAN More nods, ad-libbed agreement. The Broker Guy is impressed. Excusing herself, Dylan turns and subtly touches her ear, where she's wearing a hidden radio.
DYLAN: For my money, Keppler-Wilson is a strong choice.
NATALIE: ( CONTINUED )
NATALIE: ( covering ) Anytime, day or night, I am. excited . to be handing out champagne.
DYLAN: He's cute.
NATALIE: I'm working.
DYLAN: Sixty-five percent of relationships begin in the workplace.
NATALIE: He's a bartender. I need dependable. I need reliable. I need a Volvo man.
NATALIE: Miss! Miss! I'd love some champagne.
PETE: He starts filling more flutes.
NATALIE: What are you reading?
PETE: You know Michio Kazura?
NATALIE: Hello? Warriors of the Broken Earth? Classic.
PETE: I know. I just moved back from Tokyo. It was the biggest thing since Haikiri Nomura.
NATALIE: Tomuru nasgawa ishi Tokyo sen!
PETE: Nagada quing-gong ni. Ni zeru.
ON DYLAN: Ask him out. Ask him out.
DYLAN: Ask him out. Ask him out.
ON NATALIE: She turns and heads back.
NATALIE: I'm Natalie.
PETE: Pete. Good to meet you.
NATALIE: Listen, there's an animation festival at the Egyptian this week. I was wondering if you might want to.
PETE: Tomorrow night? Eight o'clock?
NATALIE: I'll meet you there.
ON DYLAN: She smiles, hearing the deal close. Pushing through a cluster of investors, she bumps into a THIN MAN.
DYLAN: Pardon me.
ON NATALIE: I'm on it.
NATALIE: I'm on it.
NATALIE: ( offering ) Vegetarian spring roll?
DYLAN: You call it.
NATALIE: You take point. I'll circle behind.
DYLAN: INT. HALLWAY - DAY The Thin Man is headed down the hall. Looking back, we see Dylan enter from the ballroom.
DYLAN: Excuse me?
NATALIE: has come around from the other side. His bad guy instincts tell him these women are working together. He's boxed in. And then, a DING! Elevator doors open beside him. He looks in to see the clue- less BELLBOY, who had a funky groove going on his headphones. In a single motion, the Thin Man yanks the guy out into the hallway and takes his place. Hits the button. From opposite directions, Natalie and Dylan run to the elevator, but the doors have already shut. Checking the They take the stairs.
DYLAN: He's going down.
NATALIE: That way.
THREE SHOTS: ring out. They dive for cover behind a massive washer ANGLE ON the Thin Man, planning his next move. With no good shot at the angels, he aims high, both guns BLAZING. He shots out the pipes over their heads, sending down a cascade of hot water. Dylan and Natalie scramble back to avoid getting scalded. Other pipes SHATTER from the change in pressure, leading to an interior thunderstorm. Steam fills the room as an inch of water grows on the floor. Natalie and Dylan push rolling laundry carts in the Thin Man's direction. He shoots at them, but quickly realizes they're just trying to waste his bullets. Holstering one of his guns, he dials his cell phone.
NATALIE: There are times I wish we carried Where's the challenge in that?
DYLAN: Where's the challenge in that?
DYLAN: As she creeps up behind the cover of the rolling laundry carts. She's succeeded in circling behind the Thin Man as he talks on the phone. She clears her throat. The Thin Man turns. She kicks him in the jaw. Knocked back, he drops the phone, which CRACKS and slips under a washing machine. He crab-walks back, then suddenly springs back to his feet. We weren't expecting that kind of ninja move out of this guy.
NATALIE: right behind him. With a coiled towel, she grabs his gun arm and expertly flips him. But he reacts smoothly, rolling over to charge at Natalie, picking her up like a sack of potatoes. As he does, he grabs her right in the tit.
NATALIE: Hey! Hands off, assh..
NATALIE: Okay, to summarize? Damn.
BOSLEY: Well. That was easy.
NATALIE: No, it wasn't.
BOSLEY: In English?
NATALIE: We need to tap this phone line at the source, THEN we'll know where his calls were coming from.
DYLAN: ( checking out the numbers ) 503? That's not local, where is it?
NATALIE: Bos, can we check a directory?
ALEX: Don't bother. I know where it is. I used to spend every winter there.
NATALIE: Hey look! Mechanical bull.
DYLAN: Eyes on the prize, Nat. We gotta tap the phones.
ALEX: That looks like our target.
DYLAN: I think that can be arranged.
DYLAN: sidles up to the bar. A group of three rednecks are downing shots, one after another.
REDNECK: Hey baby, why don't you ditch that stiff and come sit on ma lap?
DYLAN: Ooh, that is an enticing offer. But I got a better idea. How about a shot contest? My treat?
NATALIE: Mind if I try?
DYLAN: Hey, I've got an idea. Now let's have a chair throwing contest.
REDNECK: Chair throwing? Never heard of it? You just pick up your chair and throw it as far as you can.
DYLAN: Chair throwing? Never heard of it? You just pick up your chair and throw it as far as you can.
THUG ONE: We expecting somebody?
DYLAN: Guten Tag!
NATALIE: ( correcting Dylan ) Guten Morgen!
DYLAN: ( correcting Natalie ) Guten Nacht!
THUG TWO: ( low ) They got the wrong address.
THUG ONE: Shut up.
ALEX: Where's Knox?
KNOX: Who are you?
ALEX: The calvary. Giddy up.
ALEX: Sorry. Wrong room. Back! Run!
BOSLEY: Alex, what's your status?
ALEX: Good news: I found Knox.
DYLAN: This way.
ALEX: They're coming after us.
DYLAN: ( to Knox, confident ) We were expecting that.
NATALIE: Okay, new problem.
BOSLEY: I don't suppose giving up would be a.
DYLAN: There is no right.
NATALIE: There is no right.
DYLAN: ( CONTINUED )
DYLAN: Where are we?
ALEX: It's a bobsled run.
NATALIE: If it goes down the mountain, that's all I need.
ALEX: ( looking out the back ) Hard left! HARD LEFT!
KNOX: ( to Dylan ) Is this part of the plan?
DYLAN: Yes. Except for the bobsled run, and the backwards part, it's going exactly according to plan.
DYLAN: I think we're in the clear.
DYLAN: Or maybe not.
NATALIE: Oh God, no.
DYLAN: What is it?
NATALIE: I have a date with Pete. Right now.
DYLAN: HARD RIGHT!
ALEX: HARD RIGHT!
HARD RIGHT!: Natalie makes the hard right. The motorcycles are gaining on them, but Natalie and Dylan have to talk through this first.
DYLAN: Call him, he'll totally understand.
NATALIE: "Gee, sorry Pete. I had to rescue a Hard left!
ALEX: Hard left!
NATALIE: I'll sound like a flake. I can't stand flakes.
DYLAN: He will so give you the second chance.
NATALIE: You think?
DYLAN: Hello, I saw the way he looked at you.
ALEX: We're at the bottom!
DYLAN: ( genuinely impressed ) Well done.
KNOX: CUT TO:
HELICOPTER: thunders over. We are.
BOSLEY: I think that went very well. Charlie should send me on more missions.
ALEX: We couldn't have done it without you, Bos.
DYLAN: She offers him an airplane-sized bottle of Johnnie Walker black. He takes it and toasts. They both down their drinks in a single shot. A smile, and then. MUSIC rises. THE ANGELS TRIPTYCH descends. The act is over. After a beat, we
CHARLIE'S VOICE: Good work, Angels. Not only did you save Knox, you saved his company as well.
DYLAN: I think that earns us a vacation.
NATALIE: Say, Fiji?
ALEX: ( to Natalie ) Any special guy you were thinking of inviting?
CHARLIE'S VOICE: Sorry, Angels. Our work is only
KNOX: First off, thank you. You rescued me, for which I am eternally grateful.
CHARLIE'S VOICE: That's where you come in, Angels.
NATALIE: Sounds like a plan.
CHARLIE'S VOICE: Not as easy as that, Natalie. Red Star's headquarters are as tightly guarded as a military facility. We're going to need reconnaissance on their mainframe computer system, and the best way to get that is through Mr. Corwin himself.
ALEX: Consider it done.
CHARLIE'S VOICE: Dylan, I need you to arrange for Mr. Knox's security. I'd hate to have him kidnapped again.
DYLAN: Absolutely. But we'd all feel safer if you could join us, Charlie.
UNDERWATER: From Charlie's P.O.V., looking up at the sunlight. Three manta-rays swim above us. We can hear the BUBBLES from Charlie's regulator.
CHARLIE: I'd love to Angels. But I'm in a bit over my head at the moment.
DYLAN: We're good.
DYLAN: I've got surveillance on all the windows. Don't answer the door, don't answer the phone.
DYLAN: Also, stay away from the windows.
KNOX: They're bullet-proof. The last owner was paranoid.
DYLAN: ( a smile ) Lucky for us.
KNOX: Which one of you?
DYLAN: Whoever's closest.
KNOX: I have a better idea.
DYLAN: ( CONTINUED )
KNOX: Stay for dinner. I'm a pretty good cook.
DYLAN: I can't Mr. Knox. I'm sorry. If you.
KNOX: ( quickly ) I'm scared.
DYLAN: Don't be.
DYLAN: That's you, hunh? Cute kid. Cute It's the only picture I have of me with my parents. They died a week later.
KNOX: ( taking the photo ) It's the only picture I have of me with my parents. They died a week later.
DYLAN: Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. I had no idea.
KNOX: Please, don't apologize. I was too young to understand. I never knew how they died. When I was a kid, when I got shuffled from one foster home to another, I always thought they just disappeared.
DYLAN: I only found out later, my father was in the military. He and my mother were killed while he was on assignment, somewhere in Eastern Europe. The files were classified, but I read enough to know that he was a good man. Apparently, he was betrayed by one of his own team.
KNOX: I only found out later, my father was in the military. He and my mother were killed while he was on assignment, somewhere in Eastern Europe. The files were classified, but I read enough to know that he was a good man. Apparently, he was betrayed by one of his own team.
DYLAN: Wow. That's a lot for a kid to live with.
KNOX: Yeah, but it motivated me, losing my family. It still does. I don't take anything for granted.
DYLAN: Boy did I have you pegged wrong.
KNOX: ( intrigued ) How do you mean?
DYLAN: Well, to be honest, I thought you were a rich kid who inherited everything. But that's pretty typical. I've got instincts for the job, but when it comes to men? Well.
KNOX: I'm glad you don't see me as just a client.
DYLAN: Oh. Well, you ARE, so.
KNOX: Is there someone you need to be going home to?
DYLAN: ( beat ) But I.
KNOX: Shouldn't you?
DYLAN: ( firmly ) No. I shouldn't.
CORWIN: What the.?
PIT BOSS: ( yelling over the
NICE RACING!: ( beat )
NATALIE: ( Texas accent )
DYLAN: I'm on it.
CORWIN: LET'S GO! WE'RE LOSING TIME HERE!
THIN MAN: You okay, Boss?
CORWIN: No thanks to you! You're supposed to be my head of security! Who is that bitch?!
THIN MAN: Don't know. I'll keep an eye out.
CORWIN: Yeah. You do that.
BOSLEY: Let's make the switch.
KNOX: VIDEO FREEZES.
CHARLIE'S VOICE: So if we want to find proof that Red Star stole Knox's technology, that's the computer to tap.
KNOX: Exactly. But they have heavy firewalls and encryption. You can't jack in from outside. You'll have to physically be in that room to get at the data.
ALEX: Even if we do get inside, there won't be time to search for it. There's got to be a hundred terabytes of information there. It could take days.
NATALIE: So you install a transmitter.
VIVIAN WU: That's all fine in theory. But you still have to get inside that room to install it. What about security?
ALEX: Red Star has a lot of Government contracts, so security is tight. Key- card badges throughout. Redundant security at all red-line areas with biometric scanners and weekly keycodes. Pervasive video surveillance, lasers, air-displacement sensors. Plus a hard- wired fail-safe at the relay to prevent exactly this kind of tapping.
VIVIAN WU: It sounds impossible.
DYLAN: It sounds like fun.
A VOICE: Tommy? You gonna let me through or what? Oh. Yeah, sorry Mr. Corwin.
ALEX: It's done. Red Star's mainframe is open for business.
DYLAN: ( to a passing waiter ) Champagne, please. Your best.
KNOX: Now I know why I hired you. You're the best.
VIVIAN WU: ( to Knox, re: laptop ) I'll have Systems get to work on this right away.
BOSLEY: Uh, actually Miss Wu, WE will get to work on this right away. Any evidence we find will be turned over to you AND the proper authorities.
VIVIAN WU: I don't think you understand how important that data is, Mr.
BOSLEY: Oh, indeed I do. And that's why I'll take very good care of it when I find it.
VIVIAN WU: ( reaching for the laptop ) Vivian, please. Do as the man says.
KNOX: Vivian, please. Do as the man says.
DYLAN: Where you off to, Bos?
BOSLEY: Uh oh, lemme guess. You're off to chase bikinis at some tropical resort?
NATALIE: Uh oh, lemme guess. You're off to chase bikinis at some tropical resort?
BOSLEY: Exactly! Fire Island, here I come!
KNOX: More champagne?
NATALIE: Have to go. Plans tonight.
ALEX: Me too.
KNOX: ( to Dylan ) And you?
DYLAN: Um. well.
NATALIE: Hey Dylan, can we talk to you for a second?
DYLAN: So what, so I like him. Is that so wrong?
NATALIE: Uh, yeah Dylan, it IS. He's a client.
DYLAN: WAS a client. We finished the job.
ALEX: She's got a point.
NATALIE: What? She doesn't have ANY point, Alex, I can't believe you're siding with her.
ALEX: I'm not siding with anyone, but technically, he is no longer.
NATALIE: You know Charlie would NEVER approve of this.
ALEX: Oh come on, Charlie wouldn't care. I think you're just being overly cautious.
DYLAN: Uh, guys? GUYS!
VIVIAN WU: NO! Not until I've got the information I need. We'll take him to the compound, hold him there. In the meantime, we've got to tie up some loose ends.
THIN MAN: Whenever you say something like that, it means more work for me.
VIVIAN WU: ( ignoring him ) The Angels will figure out they were duped. We can't afford them jeopardizing our plans.
VIVIAN WU: ( coldly ) We have to Kill Charlie's Angels.
JASON: Alex, I can't tell you how happy I am you came.
ALEX: Me too.
JASON: No, I mean, it's weird. It's weirding me out how happy I am when you're around. Am I sick or something?
ALEX: ( smiling )
JASON: The only bummer is, I start to jones when you're not around. What the hell am I gonna do this weekend, if you're not with me?
ALEX: We'll get you some sedatives. You'll be fine.
JASON: Hey. Wait a second. Come with me!
ALEX: Come with you?
JASON: Miami, on the Sony Jet. I've got two tickets to the Final Four.
ALEX: Jason, I don't.
JASON: Wait, before you say no, let me just say something, okay? I'm sick of how little we see each other. I'm sick of stealing a day here, or a week there.
ALEX: It's my job, Jason. I can't explain it, but I have to be on call, all the time, and.
JASON: What if I changed all that?
ALEX: Gunfire! Get down!
JASON: Fine. I'm fine. They're squibs, it's fake. See?
REVEAL: that we are in a soundstage, the cobblestones street is just a set. The gunfire was coming from some effects guys, who are test firing guns for the upcoming action scene just outside the soundstage, visible through the open loading door.
ALEX: Sorry about that, I.
JASON: ( smiling ) God, I loved that. The way you yelled and everything? Baby, you been watching too many movies. ( he kisses her on the nose ) Alright, I gotta go reset these. DON'T GO ANYWHERE. I want to finish this conversation.
ALEX: Nice, Alex. Real nice.
THIPP!: A wall next to her sprays a cloud of plaster. Alex looks at the hole. That's strange.
THIP, THIP!: Two more little explosions, these barely missing her face.
ON ALEX: crouched behind a wall. She looks both ways. If she tries to break for the open loading door, she'll lead the gunmen right back to Jason. Only way out of here is to head for the far wall, all the way across the building, where there's a fire exit. Taking a deep breath, she darts across the fake street.
THE GUNMEN: fire at her, one of them pulling off his silencer and going to machine gun mode. The sound of the gunshots are covered by the sound of the effects guy, test firing guns outside.
ALEX: Sees that the sets are held up by wooden support beams. She lifts her leg and delivers a solid blow, cracking the two-by-fours in half.
THE GUNMEN: move slowly through the fake street set. Suddenly, they hear a creaking sound. They look up to see the whole, fake building set collapsing! They dive out of the way, just in time to see Alex race through the fire doors.
JASON: Alex? ALEX?
NATALIE: Thanks for the second chance. I swear, I'm really not a flake.
PETE: How can I deny any woman who's seen all 23 "Lords of Wind and I bet there's a dozen women here who fit that description.
NATALIE: I bet there's a dozen women here who fit that description.
PETE: Honestly there's a looks component as well.
NATALIE: You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen this close up.
PETE: You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen this close up.
NATALIE: Ladies room. I'll be back in two minutes.
PETE: I'll be here.
NATALIE: IN A STALL Natalie shuts the door behind herself, then sets to work putting down a tissue-paper seat cover.
NATALIE,: Who is perched atop the stall walls. She pushed the door with her foot. Grabbing an overhead pipe, she performs an acrobatic swing, landing both feet on the guy's head. He falls into the next row of stalls. Natalie reaches for the gun, but the Man grabs her ankles. He pulls her back across the tile floor, flipping her over. That just makes it easier for her to kick him where it counts. With a scissors lock around his neck, Natalie is pulled up while the Man falls. She lands a knee on his windpipe.
NATALIE: Who do you work for?
THE MAN: ( motioning with eyes ) Jacket pocket.
NATALIE: National Security Agency? You're with the NSA?
THE MAN: I've been following you. I didn't know which side you were on. This is bigger than you think.
NATALIE: I'm so sorry, but I have to go. I can't explain. This is my cell phone number. Please call me tomorrow. Please. I'm sorry.
DYLAN: Where's that music coming from?
KNOX: You'll see. Just a little farther.
DYLAN: ( taking in the view )
DYLAN'S POV: The hill behind Knox's house has a magnificent view right into the Hollywood Bowl. The music is the symphony playing something very romantic.
KNOX: Can I ask you a personal question?
DYLAN: How much do you know about Charlie?
KNOX: How much do you know about Charlie?
DYLAN: Well, I don't know what he looks like, but I feel like I know him. We all do.
KNOX: And none of you have any clue who he actually is?
DYLAN: And you're never curious to find out?
KNOX: And you're never curious to find out?
DYLAN: Of course, but believe me, it's impossible. I've tried. Let's not talk about Charlie, okay? Or work.
DYLAN: Eric, it's Vivian.
KNOX: Hmmm. I wonder what she's here Want me to tell her to come back, or.
DYLAN: Want me to tell her to come back, or.
KNOX: No, no. I'd better deal. You go back to bed.
DYLAN: ( CONTINUED )
NATALIE: Dylan, we were set up. Vivian Wu is not who she says she is. She's a former assassin and an all around bitch.
DYLAN: Oh no. OH SHIT. Natalie, she's HERE!
NATALIE: I'm at Knox's, she just showed up!
DYLAN: I'm at Knox's, she just showed up!
INTERCUT: I'm ten minutes away. Wait until I get there.
NATALIE: I'm ten minutes away. Wait until I get there.
DYLAN: I can't do that. Call Alex and meet me here.
NATALIE: But Dylan's already hung up. Cursing her partner, Natalie races the car even harder.
VIVIAN WU: I see you take your bodyguarding services seriously. Still, I worry that no one is watching the door.
DYLAN: ( covering ) Oh, I'm watching it. In fact, I just called for back up.
VIVIAN WU: All the same, I'm concerned about Mr. Knox's safety.
KNOX: ( explaining ) Vivian just came over to run through some numbers for the IPO.
VIVIAN WU: Please, take a seat. I'm almost
DYLAN: I'm not much for games.
VIVIAN WU: As Knox flips pages in the report, Dylan casually begins pushing Scrabble letters around, nothing serious. But she's managed to spell.
ENEMY: She gets Knox's attention, looks to the word, up to Vivian. Knox follows her intention, but doesn't seem to believe it. While Vivian continues to talk on the phone, Knox sets his report down. Pushes around some letters of his own. The words finally come out as.
KNOX: Sorry Dylan. I knew this moment would come sooner or later. I was just hoping for later.
DYLAN: All this time, we thought Red Star was behind this, but it was you. You faked your kidnapping.
KNOX: To gain your trust. And get your I want you to know, my personal attraction to you was a sincere and unrelated complication.
DYLAN: Oh, well, in that case I feel a lot better about you being a lying pole
KNOX: Why not? You trust Charlie and you've never even met him.
BLAM!: the bullet misses Dylan and slams into the bulletproof window causing a spider-web crack to spread. Dylan sees her opportunity and heads right for the window while Vivian pumps off shots. As she comes to the window, Dylan jumps up in the air and does a flying kick, hitting right at the spot where the bullet impacted.
SMASH!: The bulletproof glass shatters outward, and Dylan flies out the window, onto the ledge.
VIVIAN WU: Oh, shut up.
VIVIAN WU: She can't have survived. It's too far.
KNOX: We've got more important things to do.
DYLAN: I can't believe Knox tried to kill me. I mean, I've been lied to, I've been cheated on, but no guy has ever tried to SHOOT me before. I'm gonna get him for that.
ALEX: He played us from the very start. It was all just so he could get us to tap into Red Star. He couldn't figure out a way to do it himself.
NATALIE: Who knew that we are actually tapping into the main servers for The National Security Agency?
DYLAN: And now, thanks to us, he's had hours to download whatever top secret information he wants, for God knows what reason.
NATALIE: Wait a minute. We installed the transmitter, yes, but we never gave him the receiver.
ALEX: That laptop was the only way to access the transmitter. And we gave the laptop to.
NATALIE: That laptop was the only way to access the transmitter. And we gave the laptop to.
ANGELS: And on that note.
ALEX: Come on, Bosley, answer. I've tried all his numbers and paged him five times. No answer.
NATALIE: I don't even want to think about what I'm thinking right now.
DYLAN: Don't! He's alive, he's gotta be. If. What IS that?
BOSLEY: I know you can't answer, but. I really hope you can hear this.
DYLAN: Can we trace him?
NATALIE: Not off a boosted signal. We'd have to be within 20 miles.
ALEX: Come on, Bosley. Tell us where you are.
BOSLEY: I don't know where I am, really. I'm in a round room. The walls are white. Well. Not white-white. More of a cream, or an eggshell. Vanilla. Yes, I'm going to say vanilla.
INTERCUT: This isn't helping.
ALEX: Dylan finds a globe amid the wreckage. Wipes off the soot.
BOSLEY: I don't know which ocean. I was blindfolded the whole time. We were flying. It must've been three or four hours. Maybe more.
DYLAN: ( frustrated ) He could be anywhere in North America.
BOSLEY: Wherever it is, they have really good pudding.
DYLAN: ( incredulous ) What, pudding?
NATALIE: Hear that? That's a blue spotted egret. They only live in one place.
ALEX: The MUSIC revs up, as we.
KNOX: THIN MAN
THIN MAN: Our access was cut off at the source.
KNOX: THIN MAN
GODDAMNIT!: THIN MAN
THIN MAN: But not before we retrieved the information you wanted.
KNOX: ( beat ) How about Bosley? Did we get the information we wanted?
THIN MAN: Once we we drugged him, he sang like a bird.
KNOX: Hmmm. Miami Arena. Preparations have been made?
THIN MAN: Yes. We move out tonight.
KNOX: ( beat ) Where IS Bosley?
THIN MAN: In the tower. We were waiting till you gave the word.
KNOX: Well? No time like the present.
HENCHMAN: Sir? You should take a look at this.
SECURITY ROOM: A room lined with monitors that survey the courtyard. Henchman points to one in the corner.
THIN MAN: It's not moving. Oh, this is the oldest one in the book. Punch up camera three.
NOW: The thin man and his boys lead Dylan into the house.
DYLAN: Oh yeah? And I suppose you could do better?
THIN MAN: Yeah, I sure as hell could.
DYLAN: Oh, right.
THIN MAN: How about an underwater entry? Or hang gliding over the main tower? There's a million good ways in, if you just do your homework.
ALEX: You heard the man.
NATALIE: Nice work, Dyl.
THIN MAN: Present for you, sir.
KNOX: Dylan, how nice. Welcome to my Florida home. Not as tasteful as the one in LA, but much more private.
DYLAN: So tell me, Knox, what's the brilliant plan? You gonna sell a list of our foreign spies to the highest bidder? Blackmail the President?
KNOX: The first plan is too complicated, and the second is virtually Besides, I already have all the money I need and my motivation is much simpler. . revenge.
DYLAN: Revenge? Against who?
KNOX: You know what? I'm not in a gabby mood right now. I've got a score to settle.
DYLAN: Seems like you're going a bit overboard.
KNOX: No, just leaving myself plenty of margin for error. Goodbye, Dylan.
DYLAN: I don't know why you bother. I've already won.
THIN MAN: Is that so?
DYLAN: Every moment I sit here is a moment I'm using to figure out how to take you down. In fact, this statement this one I'm making right here is just me stalling for time while I decide which of your goons I'm going to flatten It's gonna be the guy behind me. By the time your guys are firing, I'll be at about 180 on my reverse inverted 360, which will land me on Fat Boy there, as promised. He'll take the chair seat in the Now. I'm warning both of you: I'm going to get you to shoot each other. I know. Cliche as that Last, you guys hell, I'll make something up. We'll have fun.

I'm warning both of you: I'm going to get you to shoot each other. I know. Cliche as that Last, you guys hell, I'll make something up. We'll have fun.
DYLAN: You won't even be here. I mean, I don't want to tell you how to do your job, but you should've killed me by now. Because I already know that your people are onto my people, which means any moment now you're going to be called out to go and deal
NATALIE: Bosley's close.
ALEX: You find him. I'll get Dylan.
NATALIE: ( yelling ) BOSLEY! Bosley, can you hear me?
BOSLEY: Natalie! Is that you?
NATALIE: How do I get up to you?
BOSLEY: There's a staircase. Look for a
NATALIE: Hello?. Pete, hi! How are you?
PETE: I'm good. I just you said you wanted me to call.
NATALIE: I did. I do. I mean, thank you for calling.
INTERCUT: I'm not an insecure person or anything, and I've really enjoyed the very brief time we have spent together.
PETE: I'm not an insecure person or anything, and I've really enjoyed the very brief time we have spent together.
NATALIE: ( into phone ) Can you hold on a sec?
SURGE SUPPRESSOR,: electric cords attached. She backhands it into the goons, who jerk and twitch as electricity shoots through their bodies.
PETE: Listen, is this a bad time?
NATALIE: No. Not at all.
PETE: You just sound distracted.
NATALIE: You know, work this week has been really busy. It's been hard to focus.
PETE: Natalie, what was that?
NATALIE: ( yelling to phone ) Everything's fine!
VIVIAN WU: Hate to disagree.
PETE: ( confused ) No, it's Pete.
NATALIE: You bitch! I like that guy.
VIVIAN WU: To be honest?
NATALIE: I can handle villainy. I can even handle super-villainy. But what you did is just wrong.
DYLAN: Here we go.
BOSLEY: Oh my God, let me help you.
KNOX: Let's GO!
NATALIE: Don't worry, we'll get him.
DYLAN: You don't understand. He's got a pound of C-5 in that briefcase.
ALEX: The question is, where's he headed?
DYLAN: Not that I don't believe you, but how exactly do you know all this?
BOSLEY: Because Angels, I was the one who purchased those tickets.
NATALIE: But Bosley, you HATE sports, why would you. You didn't buy them for yourself.
ALEX: You bought them for.
ANGELS: They race out the courtyard, in hot pursuit.
CHARLIE!: They race out the courtyard, in hot pursuit.
DYLAN: What do you think he looks like?
ALEX: Sixty, tall, well-built.
NATALIE: I always saw him as younger.
DYLAN: Definitely. With black hair.
NATALIE: No, silver hair. And tan.
ALEX: He's not George Hamilton.
NATALIE: He's outside a lot.
DYLAN: We'll know him when we see him, that's for sure.
ALEX: IF we see him.
NATALIE: How hard can it be to spot Charlie?
DYLAN: Aw, shit.
ALEX: I'll take the luxury boxes.
DYLAN: I'll take the mezzanine.
NATALIE: I got the floor.
JASON: Yes, yes!
ALEX: ( yelling ) Charlie!? Charles Townsend!
JASON: ( beat )
ALEX: ( beat )
JASON: ALEX! Hey.
DYLAN: ( looking everywhere ) Charlie! Charlie!
FLASHES FIRE: in the stands.
STATISTICIANS: scribble at their monitors. Natalie runs behind them, scanning the crowd. WHIP PANS, from ONE MAN to ANOTHER to ANOTHER. Stopping on a likely candidate.
NATALIE: LIKELY CANDIDATE
LIKELY CANDIDATE: THE SCOREBOARD CLOCK counts down. :60. :59. :58.
ALEX: Charles Townsend? Anybody, Charles
ALEX: immediately goes to intercept him, but.
ALEX: Jason, hi, I.
JASON: No you can talk to me NOW. I want to know what the hell is going on. First, you disappear with no explanation, not even a goodbye.
ALEX: I'm sorry, I.
JASON: Now, I see you here, but you're with some other guy.
THIN MAN: Hey, movie star, do yourself a favor and get lost.
JASON: Lemme guess. You must be Charlie?
ALEX: Jason, please.
JASON: No, no I'm sick of this shit. I'm sick of this asshole telling you what you can and can't do.
THIN MAN: That was stupid.
ALEX: Jason, get down!
JASON: What the hell is going on?
ALEX: Right now, just by leaning forward, I could crush your windpipe. You'd die a slow and painful death. You don't want that, do you?
ALEX: Hi, Jason. Gimme one second?
ALEX: I lied to you Jason. I'm not a Yeah, I can see that.
JASON: Yeah, I can see that.
ALEX: ( referring to the And that wasn't Charlie.
JASON: I'm actually here to stop a madman from killing everyone in this building. Would it be okay if we talked later?
ALEX: I'm actually here to stop a madman from killing everyone in this building. Would it be okay if we talked later?
JASON: Go save the world, honey. I'll be waiting for you.
REFEREE: Time out!
DYLAN: ( to herself ) Alright, Dylan, all we have to do is figure out which wire to cut.
ALEX: You're kidding me.
NATALIE: is fully transformed on the court, from wallflower to full- out cheerleader. It's not that she's as good as the other cheerleaders. She's better.
DYLAN: Chartreuse and magenta. This has gotta be it.
DYLAN: It's gonna blow anyway, once the clock gets to zero.
KNOX: Who told you that, my idiotic henchman? Do you think I tell him ANYTHING that's confidential?
DYLAN: Yeah, I fall for assholes, and you ARE one.
KNOX: Good one. Well, I must be going. If you like your body parts attached to your torso, I suggest you do the same.
ALEX: Give it up, Knox. You're surrounded.
NATALIE: Give us the detonator.
KNOX: Stumbling backwards, Knox holds it up high.
NO!: Stumbling backwards, Knox holds it up high.
KNOX: That's right, it's Charlie. Finally, after all these years, we get a look at him, and boy is it. disappointing. He's not what we expected. Short, portly, dressed in a "We're #1" t-shirt; the Angels are absolutely floored by Charlie's appearance.
ANGELS: Charlie ignores their stares and addresses Knox directly.
CHARLIE: Your father was a double agent, Eric. Yes, I revealed him, but he was killed by his own people before we could throw him in jail. He was my friend.
KNOX: It's still your fault, you arrogant prick! You still killed my father!
CHARLIE: Maybe. Maybe I did. But why should YOU kill all these people? If you hate me so much, just shoot ME. Just shoot me, Eric.
KNOX: Okay. You're right. I'll just kill you.
BLAM!: It all happens in the blink of an eye. Knox fires, hitting Charlie in the chest. Natalie leaps out and tackles Knox. Alex dives and grabs the detonator, before it has a chance to go off. Dylan runs to Charlie's side.
DYLAN: Charlie, no. NO!
VOICE: Ucch, that tasted terrible!
NATALIE: Bosley! Are you okay?
BOSLEY: Think so.
DYLAN: Hey, wait a second. If Bosley's here. then where's Charlie?
CHARLIE'S VOICE: Great work, angels. You'll be happy to know you received another presidential commendation.
THE ANGELS: Thank you Charlie.
CHARLIE'S VOICE: Alex, Natalie I know you've been putting in some long hours on this case, so I thought you might enjoy a chance to catch up with some old friends.
DYLAN: Any chance you'll be joining us,
CHARLIE: ( to cell phone ) I'd love to, Angels. But I have some precious treasures to watch over.
DYLAN: To Charlie.
