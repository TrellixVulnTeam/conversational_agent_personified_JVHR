MONTAGED: Andrew skulks around the party, which is clearly in full swing. Lots of bad footage of people talking, drinking, girls dancing sexy, guys joking around. Andrew is silent and detached, just filming. He sees a girl, CASEY Letter, 16, filming as well. They shout over the music.

STEVE: Is there a light on that? On your Oh, I don't- Hm, I don't know-
STEVE: They've reached the woods, and Steve is climbing over the remains of a fence. The light bounces around wildly.
STEVE: Me and your cousin were blazing a Matt's out here?
STEVE: A bunch of people were out here, but I think they've all gone back, now, cause we're like, obsessed with the thing.
STEVE: Andrew Detmer, that's right. I remember you from homeroom, Freshman year.

STEVE: We didn't dig the hole, man.
MATT: Is the sound on the camera?
STEVE: Do you guys wanna go in and have a look, or what-
STEVE: Hold your nose.
MATT: Steve, come on, we don't know if it's stable in there- It's probably just the wind, we should-
STEVE: Yeah, really far. It's not a cave, it's like a tunnel- do you hear how loud that's getting?
STEVE: Come on, man. Come on.
STEVE: Huh. I dunno. I don't believe in Who said anything about ghosts.
MATT: -shouldn't have come in here.
MATT: At first I thought this was a solutional cave, but now.I dunno, it's like a lava tube, or I don't know what you're talking Look at the walls. Look at how smooth they are. It's just straight shot down, I mean, we must've already gone forty or fifty Don't talk about it, you're making me nervous.
MATT: Look at the walls. Look at how smooth they are. It's just straight shot down, I mean, we must've already gone forty or fifty Don't talk about it, you're making me nervous.
MATT: You ever hear of Plato's allegory of the cave?
MATT: Walking. Darkness. The cave is even tighter now. The light flickers, some kind of electrical disturbance, then goes out completely We hear Andrew curse, fumbling with it, and the nightvision mode comes on.
MATT: Is that, is that showing up on the I don't wanna film it, it's messing with the camera- Touch one!
STEVE: Touch one!
MATT: -changes color, see? It must be reacting to the heat, some kind of exothermic reaction-
STEVE: Make it change again! This is
AGHHHHH!: Blood has begun to rapidly pour out of his eyes, ears, mouth and nose, and he buckles forwards; the camera spins wildly and we see Matt seemingly FLUNG out of the crystalline It pulses, and seems to rapidly blossom and spread apart, revealing a blinding light within which EXPLODES OUTWARD; we can suddenly hear an OVERWHELMING CHOIR OF VOICES, and the camera sent rocketing backwards, flipping backwards up the FROM ANDREW'S SECOND CAMERA. EXT. MATT'S BACKYARD - AFTERNOON The camera turns on; from the quality of the picture, it's immediately evident that this is a newer, better camera. It's on a tripod, and Matt stands across a well manicured backyard; his hair is a little different, time has passed.
MATT: ANDREW ( O.S. )
MATT: Okay, ball test. Take one.
UNDERHAND!: Steve comes in from off camera to help Matt, laughing; we can hear Andrew laughing behind the camera, too.
STEVE: I'm sorry, oh shit, I'm sorry-
MATT: WE ARRREEE THE CHAAAMPIONS-
ANDREW: Ah, shit.
MATT: Matt gets nailed in the balls, and drops as Steve and Andrew rush to him, laughing.
STEVE: `In the- penis- the penis-
MATT: I thought I heard my dad.UGHHH
ANDREW: The trick is to pretend like it's on a plate. You get it on the plate and then you wrap the plate around it, and you can move it however you want.
STEVE: I've been pretending I was like, holding it in a fist, like a floating hand.
MATT: I've been pretending I was like, holding it in a fist, like a floating hand.
ANDREW: Yeah? Plate's easier for me.
STEVE: Guys, check it out.
MATT: That's what I'm doing, it's just, it's hard. You're better at this than me, you do it.
ANDREW: ( mocking )
MATT: ( wowed, laughing ) Dude, holy shit!
STEVE: Guys, listen, listen. Samantha.
STEVE: What would you suggest, as like, a course of action for me, here?
MATT: Why are you asking US for advice on Because we're his mistress.
STEVE: -new camera's working out for you, that's good.
STEVE: You don't feel like it's a little weird? Like it puts a barrier between you and everything?
STEVE: Okay. I respect that.
STEVE: So how do you pay for your shit?
STEVE: What about your mom.
STEVE: I've actually been having some problems with my parents, too.
STEVE: Nothing like yours, though. Not- Never mind.
STEVE: Yeah. I know. I'm actually, yeah, I'm sure my mom is cheating on my I just, you know, I saw some stuff. It's weird, you don't think about your parents as like.people, or whatever. I don't know.
STEVE: I just, you know, I saw some stuff. It's weird, you don't think about your parents as like.people, or whatever. I don't know.
STEVE: INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREW'S ROOM "useless bitch," "carry your ass long enough," etc. Andrew reaches over and turns off the camera.
MATT: See last night, alone, I got my whole bed off the ground. No Yeah, I was doing weights, too.
STEVE: Yeah, I was doing weights, too.
MATT: Weights, like-
STEVE: Free-weights, a barbell. I got up to two hundred pounds before I So it's, yeah, this is my theory- it's like a vagina. Like it's elastic, but if you stretch it too far too quick it'll tear-
MATT: So it's, yeah, this is my theory- it's like a vagina. Like it's elastic, but if you stretch it too far too quick it'll tear-
MATT: And that's why we're getting better. We're loosening up.
STEVE: No, I like braingina. Braingina is the shiiiiit.
STEVE: If anyone criticizes you, just call them a hater. It's like calling someone a racist, they'll just drop whatever they're complaining about and be like "I'M NOT A HATER." Nobody wants to be a hater.
MATT: I'm gonna get the gum right out of his mouth- watch this.
STEVE: ( laughing ) GUYS, WHY ARE WE RUNNING!? We don't need to run, we don't need to
MATT: That was a good one, you got that one far.

STEVE: Yeah, you got some from your ears, too. You've gotta start working it out more, Matt.
MATT: Yeah man, in between my yoga.

STEVE: Guys, guys. Look.

STEVE: That was fucking great. I mean, this just gives me so many ideas, already, stuff we could do-

LOCAL OFFICER: -looks like he'll be okay. Lucky you guys were here. Is that on? You can go ahead and turn that off.
MATT: You don't see how we can be angry? You put a man in the hospital for fucksakes. You put a man in the hospital, you hurt somebody-
MATT: Which part of that do you mean, do you mean he was being an asshole, or was it an accident? Was it an accident, Andrew, cause you're the strongest. Listen, with this, we can't fuck around, ever.
MATT: NOT LIKE THAT, ANDREW. That's- you can't use it on people, or hurt people like- Steve, help me out.
MATT: We need rules, okay. Rule #1, you can't use it on living things. Rule #2, you can't use it when you're angry-
MATT: I will fucking declare rules, okay? If we keep going, and getting stronger, we need rules. We need Damn it Andrew turn off the cam-
MATT: I'm not mad.
MATT: .Power corrupts, is all I'm saying, man.
ANDREW: What does that even mean?
MATT: I just mean that we have to think about things more now, okay? We can't just DO things, we have to think first.
ANDREW: .I understand.
MATT: It's just- nah, nevermind, we're
MATT: Steve? Where are you?
STEVE: Just try it, it's easy.
STEVE: You throw yourself at the ground. You just fall, and catch yourself, and then it's easy, I swear. Don't try to jump or you'll flip
MATT: Yeah. I'm done for now.
ANDREW: Matt moves in for a closer look at floating Andrew, and gives a glance up at Steve, who's cheering on the telephone pole.
MATT: HOLY SHIT DUDE! HOLY SHIT, DUDE, HOLY SHIT! HOLY.SHIT DUDE, HOLY

FERNANDEZ: Could you put the camera away?
FERNANDEZ: I understand that things have been very hard for you recently, Andrew, but the camera kind of- it alienates a little, you know?
FERNANDEZ: ( beat ) There's concern for your grades, Andrew. And as far as I know you've yet to apply to any colleges, so-
FERNANDEZ: Well, yes, but I still think it's worth thinking about. There are three different community colleges locally that offer great programs I don't need college, Mr. I think that's a very close-minded attitude, Andrew. I know that you come from a difficult background, and I know how horrible the pain can be when you lose a friend. But I don't think you should let this make you lose hope. I mean, this is your future. You don't want to compromise your future.

ANDREW: I've been doing a lot of reading, like you know, online, about evolution, and the way it works, and you know, natural selection. The uh. The strongest animals will always survive, and they're the ones that you know, will prosper, or grow, and survive, by feeding on the smaller animals. And as humans we- see, there's.uh- There's this thing called an Apex Predator, and basically what that is the most powerful predator in an ecosystem. And humans, you know, we're the apex predator, because there's nothing that preys on us, cause of weapons and stuff. But if something could, I bet it would.

And then.I don't know, just the main part is that I'm out and there are the stars and they just look like millions of little points of light.And Steve is there.
