DANNY: I'm sorry, Dad.I'm sorry. I didn't mean to look.
ASHE: It's okay, Danny. It's okay.
CLOSE ON: A camcorder lens as it auto-focuses, bringing Danny's distorted face into view via the lens' reflection.
NEMO: SPIDER MONKEY, lean and gangly, crouches next to Ashe, holding a marigold in his hand.
SPIDER MONKEY: Flowers for the dead, Senor?
SPIDER MONKEY: No? Suite yourself, then.
SPIDER MONKEY: You're wasting your breath, angelito. Nobody up there's listening.
WHOOSH!: We cut to an extreme high-angle shot - God's omniscient POV, leans up against his motorcycle a few yards away - big, burly, shaved head, a ciggie hanging from his lips. He's got a custom paint-job on his pearl drop gas tank - a buxom blonde doing the "wild thing" with the Grim Reaper. Curve's also the one who just dusted himself
CURVE: leans up against his motorcycle a few yards away - big, burly, shaved head, a ciggie hanging from his lips. He's got a custom paint-job on his pearl drop gas tank - a buxom blonde doing the "wild thing" with the Grim Reaper. Curve's also the one who just dusted himself
CURVE: ( hyped on drugs )
DANNY: I'm scared, Dad.
ASHE: I know.
ASHE: Listen to me, please. He's just a kid. Let him go. He can't hurt you. He doesn't even know who you are.
ASHE: Danny's body slumps forward, dragging Ashe down next to him. Ashe stares into his son's lifeless eyes.
NO!!!: Danny's body slumps forward, dragging Ashe down next to him. Ashe stares into his son's lifeless eyes.
CURVE: Nothing personal, sport. Guess you were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
CURVE: Dump 'em. Let's get this cluster-fuck on the road.
CURVE: motions to Kali and Spider Monkey. Together, the three of them heave Ashe and Danny into the ocean.
CURVE: Bon voyage, shitheads.
ASHE'S POV: falling further and further away from the light of the surface world. Bit by bit, Ashe's struggles subside. All we hear now is an ever-slowing HEARTBEAT. Darkness begins to close in around us, womblike, peaceful.
THE CROW: rides the thermals above an urban sprawl riven by fires, floods, and earthquakes. Smog hangs in the air like an army of ever-present ghosts. We pass over a roof where someone has painted a smart-ass welcome mat for the benefit of anyone flying overhead - "GO BACK". Nevertheless, we continue on.
THE CROW: sweeps down into man-made caverns of pigeon-shit concrete and grimy glass. Through the bird's eyes we glimpse the city's silent HOMELESS. Automobile hulks littering the streets like insect husks. The shifting searchlights of police helicopters.
SARAH: Hey, Gabriel.
SARAH: reaches the shower, strips off her clothes. Her back and upper arms are decorated with graceful tattoo work - a pair of black angel wings sweeping over her shoulder blades. She's got a ring in her navel, another in a nipple.
SARAH: ( WISTFULLY ) Me too.
SARAH: ( DRYLY ) Nice place you've got here.
GRACE: ( a muttered whisper )
SARAH: Gotta name?
GRACE: Grace. So what?
SARAH: Listen, Grace, how does some hot coffee sound? Maybe a little What do you want?
GRACE: What do you want?
SARAH: Nothing. Guess you just remind me of someone I used to know.
THE CROW: perched on a nearby rooftop, watching them.
NOAH: What a downer - this kid wanted me to tattoo "If you're reading this, you're too close" on his bleedin' bum!
NOAH: Christ, I'm knackered.
SARAH: Beats pushing ink in Detroit.
NOAH: That it does, Princess, that it does.
NOAH: They do 'em for the Day of the Dead.
SARAH: ( reading fortune )
NOAH: Want to grab a beer, then?
SARAH: No, I gotta go home. Haven't been sleeping much lately.
NOAH: So, what's the dirty dog's name?
SARAH: I've just been having some weird dreams.
NOAH: ( calling out )
CURVE: appears outside. He POUNDS harder on the door.
CURVE: Open the fucking door!
NOAH: stands, moves to the door.
NOAH: Look, I said we're.
CURVE: You think what you did to me is funny? Some kind of joke?
SARAH: What are you talking about?!
CURVE: I'm talking about the fucking tattoo you gave me! I took off the bandages. Look.!!!
CURVE'S TATTOO: It's a crow, rendered in bold slashes of black. Or is it? Upon closer examination the crow looks like something else - two demons fighting. The design is a classic ambiguous figure - like the picture of the woman in front of a vanity which can also be seen as a skull.
SARAH: A crow.
CURVE: Then what-the-fuck is it doing there?!
SARAH: I don't know, I was just going from the design you gave me.
NOAH: Stop it!
CURVE: What's it going to be, hero? Ready to kiss your faggot-ass good-bye? I think so. I think you're shitting yourself you're so goddamn Curve snaps open an imp bag of his favorite drug, snorts up the contents. He presses the gun against Noah's forehead.
CURVE: Agh!!! SHIT!!!
SARAH: Get up.
CURVE: Shoulda killed me while you had the chance, sugarplum. Be seeing Curve smashes his fist into the neon sign, then ducks out thedoor. Moments later we hear his motorcycle ROAR to life. He takes off, ENGINE SCREAMING away into the night.
SARAH: You okay?
NOAH: Fuck me, wonder what they'll be snorting next?
SARAH: I just can't do this anymore. I'm so tired of this.
NOAH: Easy there, luv. It'll all work out.
SARAH: Get out of here! Go!!!
JUDAH EARL,: A sinewy, slash-mouthed Byronic figure with a guttural voice. Old before his time, touched by childhood visions of his own death. The tower is Judah's prison in more ways than one.
JUDAH: ( FATALISTIC ) It's finally beginning, isn't it? What mask will Death wear, can you tell me that?
SIBYL: I see the face of one of your victims.
JUDAH: All my sins remembered.
REVERSE ANGLE: on Curve as he pushes his way upstairs and through the tangle of flesh.
THE BARTENDER,: a barrel-chested Samoan, sets a drink down in front of Curve, nods a greeting. Curve sits back, opens his shirt, nudges Spider Spider Monkey, what's this tattoo look like to you?
CURVE: Spider Monkey, what's this tattoo look like to you?
SPIDER MONKEY: This a test?
CURVE: Come on, man, just tell me what you see.
SPIDER MONKEY: A bird.
CURVE: ( ANNOYED ) Think about it a minute. Don't you see two demons?
SPIDER MONKEY: Nope. I see a bird.
CURVE: Ah, fuck you, then.
SARAH: Suddenly she catches sight of a shadow on the wall before her - a GIANT BIRD slowly spreading its black wings.
SARAH: What do you want from me?!
ASHE: ( READING ) ".midway through our life's journey I came to myself within a dark wood where the straight way was lost."
ASHE'S POV: As the bubbles clear, Danny's face comes into focus just a few inches from his own.
THE CROW: flies on ahead, landing atop one of the piles, staring down into the water.
FLASHBACKS: of subjective POVs. The killers walking down the jetty, marching Ashe and Danny to their deaths and.
ASHE: digs his fingers into the wood-rot pulp of the pilings and claws his way up to the jetty. He collapses down onto the wooded slats.
ASHE: crouches before us, his face hidden from view. He reaches out his hand, touching an unmistakable BLOOD STAIN. Danny's blood stain. This triggers more painful memories.
SARAH: emerges from the shadows, staring down at Ashe in wonder.
GABRIEL: perched at the end of the bed, watching Ashe intently.
SARAH: sits on the other side of the loft in a paint-smeared work-shirt, brush in hand. She's studying a half-finished canvas, contemplating her next move.
CANVAS: The eerie scene depicting a woman on her death-bed being cradled in the arms of her ghostly lover.
ASHE: ( DISORIENTED ) .who are you?
SARAH: My name's Sarah. I had a dream about you. I saw them shoot you and your son.
ASHE: How did I survive?
SARAH: ( coming towards him )
SARAH: You're dead.
ASHE: Ashe stands, enraged. He starts toward Sarah. She backs away.
ASHE: Stop looking at me that way stop looking this isn't real, none of this is real! I'm dreaming this.
SARAH: ( shaking her head, frightened )
ASHE: ( looking at her, a tortured whisper )
DANNY: Hey, Dad.what color should I make the sun?
ASHE: There's no such thing.
DANNY: There's no such thing.
ASHE: ( PLAYFUL ) No. Well there should be.
DANNY: ( wide eyed )
ASHE: Danny, wait!
CURVE: See no evil.
DANNY'S VOICE: I'm sorry, Dad.I'm sorry.
ASHE: CURVE'S VOICE Nothing personal, sport.
NO!!!: CURVE'S VOICE Nothing personal, sport.
CURVE'S VOICE: Nothing personal, sport.
SARAH: stands in the doorway.
ASHE: Why are you here?
SARAH: I don't know.
SARAH: I want to help you. I need to.
ASHE: Everything's so confused.
SARAH: He's not here anymore.
ASHE: There's no moon.
SARAH: You've been given another chance, Ashe to put the wrong things Sarah's eyes drop to the canisters of paint which have been scattered nearby. She reaches for the canister of white and unscrews the lid, dipping her fingers inside.
SARAH: I believe there've always been people like you.
SARAH: It's the pain that brings people back. It makes us strong again.
THE CROW: flies alongside Ashe.
THE CROW: lands on a telephone wire, studying the warehouse.
SPIDER MONKEY: ASHE ( O.S. ) 'My mother was accursed the night she bore me and I am faint with envy of all the dead'.
ASHE: Tell me, Monkey. Does the corpse have a familiar face?
SPIDER MONKEY: Who the fuck are you?
ASHE: You have to learn to look beyond the mask.
SPIDER MONKEY: No way, man.we put you under.you and that little snot-nosed Ashe dips his hand into one of the 50-gallon drums. He blows a handful of the Trinity dust at Spider Monkey. Spider Monkey, terminally spooked, reaches back to the counter behind him, searching for something.
ASHE: Looking for this?
ASHE: ( an evil grin )
BOOM! ASHE: puts a bullet through his own forehead. His head snaps backward and his body collapses onto the floor. Spider Monkey creeps forward toward Ashe's body.
ASHE: springs from the ground, SLAMMING Spider Monkey against a table of chemicals. Bottles SHATTER on the floor, spilling their toxic SPIDER MONKEY What are you?! What the fuck are you?!
SPIDER MONKEY: What are you?! What the fuck are you?!
ASHE: I wasn't sure at first. Now I know. I'm the boiling man, Monkey. I'm the plague of Darkness and the death of the first-born. All your nightmares rolled into one.
SPIDER MONKEY: Whoa.this shit's flammable! Look, look, what do you want?
ASHE: The others. Who are they?
SPIDER MONKEY: Nemo. Kali. Judah. And Curve.
ASHE: I'll start with Nemo, then work my way up the food chain. Where is he?
SPIDER MONKEY: Nemo? Nemo's an old gash-hound. He hangs out at the Peep-O-Rama on Deacon Street!
ASHE: Congratulations, monkey. You just bought yourself a fighting Ashe reaches into his coat pocket, pulling out a deck of cards. He fans them out, points.
ASHE: Pick a card, monkey.
ASHE: Lady Luck's a bitch.
SPIDER MONKEY: Aw, Jesus, c'mon, man!
ASHE: You're wasting your breath, angelito. Nobody's up there listening.
THE CROW: spirals down from a telephone wire, landing atop the handlebars of Ashe's motorcycle.
ASHE: lifts his head to the night sky, laughing. His clothes are still CUT TO: INT. GRAY GARGOYLE - NIGHT Sarah is working at one of the drawing tables. Noah is mixing SARAH'S SKETCH PAD She's working on a rendering of Ashe. She sits back.
SARAH: .and all the world will be in love with night.
SARAH: Do you believe in fate, Noah?
NOAH: ( CONSIDERING ) Seeems to me it's more a question of fate believing in you.
THE CROW: flys past a line of palm trees which burst into flames.
JUDAH: lounging on a couch a few dozen yards away, watching the women on four video monitors, detached and twice removed from the sex enters from out of the shadows. Judah looks up to him.
CURVE: enters from out of the shadows. Judah looks up to him.
CURVE: Bad news.
JUDAH: Illuminate me.
CURVE: Someone torched the lab on Manchester. Spider Monkey's a fucking crispy critter.
JUDAH: Monkey I could care less about. What about our merchandise?
CURVE: A total loss.
CURVE: ( rising, uneasy )
SIBYL: Yes you do. You've seen it.
SIBYL: You've been marked.
CURVE: ( even more agitated )
JUDAH: Because she speaks the truth.
JUDAH: What's this, Curve? A beauty mark?
SIBYL: Your enemy wears the mask of the Crow. The bird of ill-omen.
JUDAH: The Crow. Death's avatar. I've heard the legends.
JUDAH: looks down at a view of the seething landscape.
JUDAH: Let him come, then.
COLLEGE!": As Nemo approaches, a laconic HINDU with a throat microphone sits outside, reciting his tired schpiel.
HINDU: Tokens for the buddy booths, live girls. Tokens for the buddy booths, live girls.
NEMO: You got a name?
WOMAN: Holly Daze. Do you want me, baby?
NEMO: I need to see some sugar.
NEMO: Right on, sister.
HOLLY: ( eyeing his endowment )
NEMO: Yeah, we're gonna celebrate Christmas a little early this year.
HOLLY: Keep doing that, honey, you'll go blind.
HOLLY: Time's almost up, lover. Better hurry up with those tokens.
NEMO: Nemo fumbles with his pants, scoops out some more tokens.
NEMO: Come on, fucker!
ASHE: is standing on the other side of the Plexiglas. His mouth splits into an evil grin.
ASHE: "Do you want me, baby?"
NEMO: CRASH! Ashe slams his fists through the Plexiglas window, reaching for Nemo's throat.
ASHE: CRASH! Ashe slams his fists through the Plexiglas window, reaching for Nemo's throat.
ZEKE: ( o.s. )
ASHE: One crow sorrow.
ASHE: .two crows joy.
DOLL: Ooh, oh baby, I like it like that. You're so good. You're so Three crows a letter, four crows a boy.
ASHE: Three crows a letter, four crows a boy.
ASHE: Five crows silver, six crows gold.
ASHE: Seven crows a secret never to be told.
NEMO: .please, please just stop.
ASHE: You killed my son, Nemo. You took away the only piece of light left in my soul.
NEMO: We had to! Judah's orders. Never leave any witnesses! We didn't have a choice!
ASHE: We always have a choice.
HOLLY DAZE: ( CRINGING ) Ashe touches her face and sees a split-second FLASH of.
BANG! ASHE: shuts his eyes, reeling.
ASHE: If you value what you've lost, you'll walk away from this place and never look back.
KALI: Kali leads the crew of killers into the porno shop. But Curve stops, sensing something. He spins around.
THE CROW: is sitting atop one of the cars, watching him.
KALI: DOLL'S VOICE Ooh, oh baby, you're so good.
DOLL'S VOICE: Ooh, oh baby, you're so good.
DOLL: .oh! Oh yea, that's the spot. Do me, baby. Do me.
ASHE'S VOICE: Do you know what they call a gathering of crows, Curve?
ASHE'S VOICE: A murder. A murder of crows. Think about it.
PRIEST: Can I help you?
ASHE: I'm sorry, Father, I was just watching.
PRIEST: Our doors are open.
ASHE: What is this for?
PRIEST: Dias de los Muertos, the Days of the Dead. We light the candles for our loved ones - so that they might find their way back to earth and share in the pleasures of the living.
PRIEST: Tomorrow night we will celebrate. The people will dance, sing.
ASHE: Some spirits linger here too long. They become confused, mistaking themselves for the living. They have to be frightened away.
PRIEST: Some spirits linger here too long. They become confused, mistaking themselves for the living. They have to be frightened away.
BOY: Santa Muerte.
ASHE: appears on the ledge of the broken window, crouching there like a gargoyle in silhouette.
SARAH: ( hesitant, but relieved )
ASHE: Heaven wouldn't have me and Hell was afraid I'd take the place Ashe drops into the loft.
ASHE: I needed to see you again.
ASHE: She looks like you.
SARAH: I paint what I see.
ASHE: Were you married?
SARAH: It belonged to a friend.
ASHE: Where are they now?
SARAH: A better place.
SARAH: What about you?
ASHE: Danny's mother left after he was born. She was a drug addict.
SARAH: ( NODDING ) I lost my mother the same way.
ASHE: Small world.
SARAH: ( meeting his gaze )
ASHE: What happens to me when I finish what I'm supposed to do here?
SARAH: You go back.
ASHE: What if I don't want to go back?
SARAH: Then you're damned
JUDAH: I thought you killed him.
CURVE: I shot him in the head!
KALI: He's a ghost.
CURVE: No such thing as ghosts.
KALI: ( POINTEDLY ) Then who killed Spider Monkey and Nemo?
CURVE: All I know is, he's fucking with us. The Crow's his symbol, right? That means I'm marked. It means he's coming for me now!
KALI: I thought you said you didn't believe?
CURVE: Look, you want to tell yourselves some bullshit fairytales, that's your business. But i'm not gonna sit here with a fucking target on my chest. I'm going to take this motherfucker out!
SIBYL: You won't stop him with bullets or knives. He doesn't feel pain. He doesn't bleed. Don't you see? His soul has crossed over. He's come back from the other side.
JUDAH: So how do you stop a man who's already dead?
SIBYL: Can you look destiny in the eye without flinching?
JUDAH: You tell me.
SIBYL: The Crow is the source of his power - his link between this world and the next. Sever that link and he's as vulnerable as the next CUT TO: INT. SARAH'S LOFT - NIGHT Ashe pushes through a curtain, turns towards Sarah's vanity SEES the knick-knacks and mementos gathered there, then SEES the ceramic irony mask which hangs above. Ashe approaches, reaching a hand out to trace its features.
ASHE: I've been here.
ASHE: I took Danny last summer. We went up on the bike, rode all the way up the coast.
SARAH: Look at me.
SARAH: Ashe. Look at me.
ASHE: ( pulling back )
ASHE: I have to finish what I started. I have to find the others.
SARAH: I know.
SARAH: I wish I'd met you before.
SCRITCH! SCRITCH!: So the Crow is Ashe's familiar.
JUDAH: So the Crow is Ashe's familiar.
SIBYL: The bird is the key, the life-force that flows within it.
JUDAH: ( UNDERSTANDING ) The blood of the Crow.
JUDAH: ( to Curve )
CURVE: Some bitch down at the Gargoyle, but what's that got to do with.
JUDAH: Everything, you idiot! Find her. If she gave you his mark, then she's connected to him in some way. She can lead us to him.
THE PAINTING: which Danny had been working on. It's got bullet holes in it Ashe throws his arms back and lifts his face to the heavens, SCREAMING, cursing his fate.
ON ASHE,: as seen from afar. A tiny figure dwarfed by the endless expanse of ocean and sky.
NOAH: ( frightened, gasping )
CURVE: A house in the country, a dog, a wife and two kids.
KALI: We're looking for Sarah. Where is she, Noah?
NOAH: I'm not going to tell you that.
KALI: Oh, but I think you are.
KALI: Last chance, "love".
NOAH: ( DEFIANT ) Get bent, you dried-up bitch.
CURVE: What is it?
KALI: What is it?
KALI: It's no good. Curve is long gone.
CURVE: TIME SLOWS TO A CRAWL The MUSIC fades to a muted echo of distant WAR DRUMS. As a feeling of inexorable doom settles over him, Curve lifts his head and reflected in the bar mirror, materializing out of the narcotic haze. He's wading through the ocean of bodies. In his face paint and black leather Ashe looks like he's just another part of the twisted scene. people are stroking him, brushing up against him - like they can leech off some of his morbid angel charisma.

ASHE: Time's up, Curve.
CURVE: Fuck you, bird-dick!
THE CROW: plunges down from the night sky, wings flapping madly, quickly gaining on Curve like the breath of death.
UP ABOVE,: Ashe appears on the overpass, riding on his own motorcycle, matching Curve's speed.
THE CROW: soars higher for a bird's eye view, tracking Curve's progress as it sweeps past chimneys, swerves around billboards, ducks under laundry lines.
ON ASHE: as he ROCKETS along the overpass. The Crow lands on his shoulder. Ahead is a break in the guard rail. Ashe cuts sharply to the right, taking the motorcycle airborne through the break in the rail and.
ASHE: .lands on the surface street some thirty feet below! Ashe is now just behind Curve.
SARAH: Who is it?
CURVE'S POV: We are now beneath the bridge. It's a stone-cold dead-end. The roadway slopes sharply downward, spilling out into the concrete river bed which is filled to capacity with rushing flood waters.
ASHE: "I have a rendezvous with Death, on some scarred slope of battered Ashe starts into the tunnel. His WET FOOTSTEPS echo off the weeping "God knows, 'twere better to be deep where love throbs out in blissful sleep, pulse nigh to pulse and breath to breath."
ASHE: "God knows, 'twere better to be deep where love throbs out in blissful sleep, pulse nigh to pulse and breath to breath."
ASHE: "But I have a rendezvous with Death. And I to my pledged word am true."
ASHE: "I shall not fail that rendezvous."
CURVE: You think i'm afraid of you, you fucking freak?! YOU THINK I'M
AFRAID?!!: Curve SCREAMS and guns his cycle forward, rolling the throttle all the way open - a kamikaze run aimed straight at Ashe.
CURVE: lies on the garbage-strewn tunnel floor in a spreading pool of blood - burnt, battered, a barb of steel sticking up from his chest. Still, Curve has one glorious, giddy moment where he thinks he's actually succeeded in defeeating Ashe, then.
CURVE'S POV: as Ashe steps through the gasoline flames.
ASHE: Can you hear me, Curve?
ASHE: You're going to die now.
ASHE: People used to put coins in the mouths of the dead. Do you know why? So they could pay the ferryman to take them across the river ( reaching to Curve's ear )
ASHE: Open your mouth, Curve.
ASHE: Shhh. It's not so bad. Trust me. I've been there.
ASHE: I want to thank you for showing me my pain, Curve. You made me what I am.
ON ASHE: As he releases Curve, letting the current carry him away. Ashe stands, tracking Curve's progress.
ON CURVE: as he floats downstream, limbs outstretched, consciousness fading CURVE'S POV GHOSTLY FACES stare down at him from the girders - people who have made their home in the underbelly of the bridge which stretches A WOMAN lets loose a cloud of marigold petals. They flutter down around Curve, swirling in the currents.
CURVE'S POV: GHOSTLY FACES stare down at him from the girders - people who have made their home in the underbelly of the bridge which stretches A WOMAN lets loose a cloud of marigold petals. They flutter down around Curve, swirling in the currents.
ASHE: is seeing what the crow is witnessing - Sarah in danger.
ASHE: Ashe starts to run, back toward his bike.
ASHE: ( alarmed, desperately looking for her )
KALI: who had been standing still amidst the shadows, now moves from behind Sarah's paintings.
ASHE: Where is she?
KALI: Judah's tower. He's waiting for you there.
ASHE: You took my son's life.
KALI: ( GASPING ) Some people are born victims.
ASHE: It takes two to make a murder.
KALI: Shall we dance?
SIBYL: is standing a few yards away, cloaked in darkness, head bowed. Sarah didn't notice her at first.
SARAH: Where am I?
SIBYL: The Tower. Everyone finds their way here eventually.
SARAH: My God. What happened to you.?
JUDAH: emerges from the gloom, almost as if he were materializing from the shadows themselves.
JUDAH: Sibyl's been cursed with the gift of prophecy. She sees things that are fated to happen.
JUDAH: .but that only made the visions stronger, didn't it, dear?
SIBYL: I've learned to live with my affliction.
JUDAH: Don't we all.
SARAH: Judah Earl.
JUDAH: My reputation precedes me.
SARAH: ( DISGUSTED ) I've seen what your drugs have done to this city.
JUDAH: ( SHRUGGING ) I saw a need, I exploited it. It's all economics, Sarah. Supply and demand.
SARAH: Why did you bring me here?
JUDAH: I'm glad you asked that, Sarah. You've got a very important part to play in this little drama of ours. You see, I intend to capture the Crow.
KALI'S POV: as Ashe approaches. The Crow flits in from off-screen, landing on his shoulder. Watching Kali with it's curious golden eyes.
KALI: ( GASPING ) Ashe stares at her, dispassionate.
KALI: Kill.me, then.finish.it.
KALI: You.have to.
ASHE: My job is to send you to hell. You're in it.
KALI: There's no.honor in this. It's my.death. I've won it..
ASHE: Me, too.
KALI: Wait! Where are you going?! Wait! You can't.do this! You can't do this!!!
THE CROW: lands on Ashe's outstretched hand.
SARAH: Why are you doing this?
JUDAH: Have you ever read Dante's Inferno? It says that the only true path through Hell lies at its center. If you want to escape it you have to go further in.
JUDAH: When I was a boy I fell through the ice of a lake. I remember seeing the sky through the ice above me, close enough to touch. The world grew cold around me. Dark. Eventually my heart stopped beating. And in that moment, I died.
JUDAH: A half-hour later I awoke on an operating table. I had returned to the world of flesh and bone But I brought a knowledge back with me.
JUDAH: I've been living on borrowed time ever since. I've always known Death would be coming for me.
SARAH: You can't stop him.
JUDAH: You're wrong, Sarah.
SIBYL: The Crow is coming.
CROW'S POV: Sarah sits within one of the pools of illumination far below, still bound to the bed by the chain. Judah and Sibyl are nowhere in sight.
THE CROW: flies down from the rafters, landing on the floor at Sarah's feet. It CAWS at her, trying to communicate.
SARAH: .go.please go.
SARAH: ( shaking her chain )
GO!!!: WHOOSH! A steel cage on a wire and pulley system CLATTERS down from above, SLAMMING to the floor and trapping the bird within it. The bird CAWS angrily, flitting from one side of the cage to another, but its efforts are futile.
JUDAH: Look who's come home to roost.
ASHE: pushes through the throng of revelers, invisible amidst the carnival atmosphere. In his makeup he's just another face in the crowd.
CAMERA TABLE: The camera lens is now trained on the night sky. A churning landscape of night-sky coulds drifts across the table's surface, creating an eerie effect.
JUDAH: sets a package wrapped in velvet on the camera table. He peels back the cloth, revealing a set of ornately decorated, tapered daggers. He looks back at Sarah.
JUDAH: Do you know what these are called? Misericords. Wonderful name, isn't it?
JUDAH: Easy, little wing. It will all be over soon.
SIBYL: who has been lurking in the shadows, suddenly lifts her head ( full of portent )
SIBYL: ( full of portent )
JUDAH: Not for long.
ASHE'S POV: Day of the Dead CELEBRANTS crowd the streets far below.
ASHE: ( in agony )
STONE MAIDEN: which protrudes from the building's facade. The maiden's face has been all but worn bare by the harsh elements.
ASHE: Ashe whispers the word like a mantra, using it to urge him on. Steeling himself again, fighting the burning pain, Ashe resumes his climb. He's on autopilot now, just trying to reach the campanile, which at this point, seems hopelessly unattainable.
JUDAH: ( WHISPERING ) Ashes, ashes, we all fall down.
SARAH: ( SCREAMING ) CUT TO: EXT. JUDAH'S TOWER - NIGHT Ashe Cries out a final time as a GAPING WOUND appears on his chest, BLOOD BLOSSOMING outward.
CITY STREET: The Day of the Dead celebrants swirl around us, Judah's Tower rising up behind the mob - an unholy ziggurat built to challenge the gods. The CROWD has been worked up into a frenzy. Everyone is singing and dancing. MUSIC blasts from loudspeakers.
ASHE: comes CRASHING DOWN atop a small vending stall filled to the brim with flowers an sugar skulls. Time slows as a flurry of golder marigold petals flutter down around his still form.
JUDAH: It's done.
SARAH: watches with a mixture of mounting horror and morbid curiousity.
JUDAH: scoops up a handful of the Crow's blood and brings it to his CLOSE ON JUDAH'S LIPS as he drinks, letting the overflow trickle down over his chin and neck.
THE CROWS: Thousands of them, filling the heavens with their KEENING WAILS.
A CHILD: wearing a skull mask pushes to the front of the crowd. He stares at Ashe a moment, then lifts the mask from his face.
ASHE: ( CONFUSED ) Ashe rushes to Danny's side, holding him tight, his disbelief overpowered by the unfettered joy of seeing his son once again.
ASHE: What are you doing here?!
DANNY: It's time to go back, Dad.
ASHE: Is that why they're here?
DANNY: ( NODDING ) They're the souls who came before you. They're crying for the people they've lost.
ASHE: But Sarah still needs me.
DANNY: You don't understand, Dad. You work for the dead, not the living. Your work here is done.
ASHE: I can't go, not yet, not now.
DANNY: You have to.
ASHE: Danny, I can't leave her like this.
DANNY: If you turn your back on the dead now, you'll be trapped between the worlds. You'll never be allowed to cross over.
ASHE: I have to stay.
DANNY: I know.
DANNY: ( FORLORN ) Good-bye, Dad.
ASHE: Danny, wait.!
JUDAH: standing just a few yards away, emerging from the doorway of his tower. He got the anti-Crow blood mask on his face. His eyes are glowing like twin stars and his lips are curled back in a feral snarl. In his hands, he holds one of the chains from his Judah grabs Ashe by the lapels of his coat, draging him close so they're eye to eye close enough to breathe the same beath two sides of a coin.
JUDAH: Tell me, Ashe. Do you every get the feeling we're all just dead men on leave?
ASHE: ( seething with hatred )
JUDAH: In the flesh.
ASHE: I'm your shadow, Ashe. Every angel's got a devil. Didn't you know that? Or maybe you just slept your way through Sunday school?
JUDAH: I'm your shadow, Ashe. Every angel's got a devil. Didn't you know that? Or maybe you just slept your way through Sunday school?
ASHE: What. did you do to me.?

JUDAH: You're flesh and blood now, Ashe. You can die like any other Go to hell.
ASHE: Go to hell.
JUDAH: Already been there. And I must confess, I liked what I saw.
SARAH: Sibyl produces a key from within her robes. She places the key in the lock on Sarah's manacles. With a turn of the key, the manacles fall away and Sarah is free.
SARAH: Why are you doing this?
SIBYL: Ashe needs you now. More than ever.
SIBYL: Go to him.
JUDAH: Looks like the dead have forsaken you, my friend.
JUDAH: Look at you, bleeding like a stuck pig. Where's your precious strength? Where's your power?
ASHE: down the street. Ashe SCREAMS as his body is dragged across the CUT TO: INT. JUDAH'S TOWER, ELEVATOR - NIGHT Sarah rushes into a rickety old elevator, pulling the accordion-style security gate shut. She punches the "DOWN" arrow on the tarnished control panel. With a lurch and HUM the elevator car starts its journey downward.
JUDAH: shouts to the crowds below, his eyes on fire.
JUDAH: You want death?! Here he is, people!!! Take a good look!!!
ASHE: is dragged up into the air, dangling above the faces of the crowd.
JUDAH: Now don't we look pretty.
JUDAH: Nice. If you prick him, does he not bleed?
ASHE'S POV: The swirling faces of the masked celebrants, with Judah front and center. Mob mentality, everyone drunk and LAUGHING, jeering at Ashe, the dangling fool. It's a scene out of Hell.
SARAH: lunges forward, clutching the misericord, shoving a reveller Get away from him!
SARAH: Get away from him!
ASHE: falls to the street as the chain CLATTERS over the street lamp. He unravels the chain from his throat and drags himself back Sarah, get back!
ASHE: Sarah, get back!
ASHE: Sarah gasps, drops to her knees, clutching at the dagger's handle. She pulls the misericord out. Blood begins to well up from the wound. She stares at her blood-covered hands in disbelief, then falls back.
SARAH!!!: Sarah gasps, drops to her knees, clutching at the dagger's handle. She pulls the misericord out. Blood begins to well up from the wound. She stares at her blood-covered hands in disbelief, then falls back.
SARAH: The crows.I can see them coming.
SARAH'S POV: Once again, the crows are wheeling around the ceiling of the BACK TO SCENE Ashe looks up at Judah, fueled by a righteous rage that's been burning since the moment of his resurrection. He rises. All reason is gone. The only think that remains for Ashe is an unbridled animal fury.
JUDAH: You can't stop me anymore, Ashe. You don't have the power.
ASHE: If it were just me, you'd be right, Judah. But I have an eternity of pain to call upon.
ASHE: And the pain gives me strength.
ASHE'S PALMS: As we watch the stigmata close themselves up, blood drawing itself back into the wounds.
ASHE: TAKE HIM!!! EXT. JUDAH'S CAMPANILE - NIGHT The murder of crows spirals down from the sky like a black tidal wave. They descend on Judah as one entity, SCREAMING down from the heavens like a storm of razor blades.
TAKE HIM!!!: EXT. JUDAH'S CAMPANILE - NIGHT The murder of crows spirals down from the sky like a black tidal wave. They descend on Judah as one entity, SCREAMING down from the heavens like a storm of razor blades.
JUDAH: We get one final glimpse of horrified Judah's face, eyes wide with terror, before the tidal wave of black wings engulfs him.
NO!!!: We get one final glimpse of horrified Judah's face, eyes wide with terror, before the tidal wave of black wings engulfs him.
JUDAH: lets loose a DEATH-SHRIEK that all but splits the sky as the myriad beaks and talons rend him limb from limb.
ASHE: You can't die, Sarah. I stayed for you.
SARAH: ( GASPING ) There's a balance that needs to be kept.someone had to cross Sarah takes a ragged breath, wincing as a wave of pain washes over her.
SARAH: I didn't want it to be you.
ASHE: ( in anguish )
SARAH: Do you love me?
SARAH: Ashe takes the ring from Sarah. She closes Ashe's hand around the ring, gripping his fist tightly.
SARAH: I'll wait for you. Forever, if I have to.
ASHE: Oh God.
SARAH: Listen.if two people really love each other.
SARAH: .nothing can keep them apart.

ASHE: moves through the crowd carrying Sarah in his arms. The people close ranks behind him and we.
ASHE: is carrying Sarah in his arms, moving through the crowd of silent nods to herself, satisfied. We see what might be a trace of a smile cross her lips.
SIBYL: nods to herself, satisfied. We see what might be a trace of a smile cross her lips.
PRIEST: Why are you still here?
ASHE: Because I have nowhere left to go.
PRIEST: What will you do, then?
ASHE: ( looking back )
GRACE,: the drugged-out girl that Sarah helped at the beginning of the film. She's looking good now, clean of the poison that once possessed her. And damned if she isn't holding Gabriel in her arms.
GRACE: Long night, huh?
GRACE: Isn't he cool? I found him on the street. I was going to take him home with me.
ASHE: You should. Looks like he needs a home.
