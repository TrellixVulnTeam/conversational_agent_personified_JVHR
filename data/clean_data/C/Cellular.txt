CHAD: They aren't giving you shit yet?
RYAN: Nah, whenever I return it, I just list off why the phone sucks and they give me a new model. Figure by the tenth time I'll have to go somewhere else.

MOONEY: Come on Powell, put the Sharks with the Sharks, the Jets with the Jets and make room.

DETECTIVE TOMLIN: Sucks for the fellas at the Two- Three right now, huh?

MOONEY: Keep walking, Shelly.   Nothing to see here.
FEMALE OFFICER: You sure you wanna do that?     What would your wife say?
MOONEY: She'd say nothing, 'cause she's not gonna know about it! Christ, Shel, my old man had eleven heart attacks. Eleven! I have one little infarction and you guys start treating me like an invalid! I'm a grown man! Leave me alone, will you?!

RYAN: I just got off the 405.
JESSICA (VO): You've got to go faster, Johnny!

RYAN (CONT'D): What do these guys want, anyway?
JESSICA (VO): How should I know?!
RYAN: What do you do?
JESSICA: I'm an obstetrician. They don't want anything from me.
RYAN: So your husband's like, uber-rich?
JESSICA (VO): What--? No. He's an accountant. I make more money than he does.
RYAN: Could they've mistaken you for someone else?
JESSICA: No! I don't know.    None of this makes any sense.
RYAN: Oh...SHIT!!

JESSICA: He was named before the singer ever-
RYAN: Forget it.     What does he look like?
JESSICA (VO): He's eight years old. Blonde hair. Green eyes. Small for his age. He's wearing a light blue shirt and dark blue pants--

RYAN: No, kid, it's okay!    I didn't mean to--
TIMID BOY: Help!   Don't touch me!   Don't touch!!
RYAN (INTO PHONE): Does he have anything else? A jacket? A backpack? What's his lunch box look like?
JESSICA (VO): I don't remember.
RYAN: You don't remember your own kid's lunch box?!
JESSICA: I don't pack it! Rosario, our housekeeper does! Sometimes Craig, but...
RYAN: Ricky Martin, where are you!?
JESSICA (VO): (through tears) I wish I could give you more.
RYAN: Ricky Martin?
MALE VOICE (OS): Can I help you, sir?
RYAN: I'm looking for a little blond boy-- (off his shocked look) --No, no! Not like that!
GYM TEACHER: Sir, come with me, please!
RYAN: Oh shit...
RICKY MARTIN! DOES ANYONE KNOW: WHERE RICKY MARTIN IS?1 I can't believe I'm yelling this at an all- boys school.
JESSICA (VO): Was that the bell? Was that the bell?!

JESSICA (VO): Yes?
RYAN: No one's gonna get your kid!    He's not slow, is he?
JESSICA (VO): What--?   No!

JESSICA (VO): Unless they have our Escalade. Ricky'11 think it's Rosario and hop right in!
RYAN: What color?

JESSICA (VO): 4..7..wait, no...3 -- Oh my God, I don't remember!
RYAN: Like you don't remember the lunch box? Or anything else about your kid-- (stops, realizing) Oh, man. This is a prank, isn't it?
JESSICA (VO): No!
RYAN: Bullshit! Oh, you're good lady. Your friends too. Getting me to scream out 'Ricky Martin' at a boys school. Damn, you really nailed me.
JESSICA (VO): No-- This is great, the police think I'm a whack job. The school thinks I'm some kind of perv child molester. I'll probably get the Herpes from the gym teacher's whistle --
JESSICA (VO): No, Johnny, you have to listen to me-- /.'
RYAN: I'm done being your entertainment for the day. I'm going back to the pier while I still have a chance --
GYM TEACHER: Here he is! He's the one that's been stalking the students.
RYAN: Stalking?!     No, I can explain--
RENT-A-COP #1: Okay, we got him. We're at the front of the school. (then, to Ryan) Sir, come with us.
RYAN: (as they grab him) Hey, HEY RENT-A-DUDE--!!    Hang on a sec! This is a huuuge misunderstanding--
JESSICA (VO): (interrupting) Lord of the Rings! I forgot his father bought him a Lord of the Rings lunchbox last week!
RYAN: (struggling)

RYAN: Okay.

ELLIS (CONT'D): Yeah.   I like Creedence too.
RICKY: Where's Rosario?
ELLIS: I told you, kid, she had a doctor's appointment, so your mother asked us to pick you up. Don't worry, you'll see your mommy in a few minutes.

COP ONE: -- so of course everyone's playing dumb to what kind of drugs he's on.
COP ONE (CONT'D): So I start searching the place. I'm about to open a closet door when a kid with a Mac 10 jumps out of the bathroom. He shoots. Misses me and hits one of the E.M.T's. Fires again, but the gun jams and BAM! Blows half his face off. Had enough black tar heroin in the closet to resurface the 405.
MOONEY: It must've been around '84, when...
COP TWO: Sorry Moon, we're late for a briefing.
DEEP MALE VOICE (O.S.): I'll bet in your day you had some stories.
MOONEY: Hey Tomlin.
DETECTIVE TOMLIN: Taking off?
MOONEY: (hardly thrilled) My anniversary. You know, duty calls; pricey dinner and then some crap-ass play. (beat) Hey, I sent some college kid down to see you this morning. Had some rap about a kidnapping --
DETECTIVE TOMLIN: I haven't seen anyone, but I'll ask around. Kidnapping, huh?
MOONEY: I thought it was a prank at first, but the kid was so worked up--
DETECTIVE TOMLIN: Well, don't you get worked up. (slaps Mooney's chest) If the kid comes back, page me, and I'll be sure to see him.
MOONEY: (swallowing his pride) Yeah. Okay, Jack. Thanks.
JESSICA (VO): Look, Johnny, you've got to go back to the cops--
RYAN: Are you high?! I just jacked a car!
JESSICA (VO): Goddamn it, stop thinking about just yourself! You can explain everything to them later!
RYAN: What now?
RYAN (CONT'D): Great!   Now the battery's dying.
JESSICA: Don't you have a charger?
RYAN: It's in my car!      Hold on.

RYAN: Whew!   That was so no bueno!
JESSICA (VO): You found a charger?
RYAN: Among other things...
JESSICA: Thank you for doing all this, Johnny.
RYAN: Yeah, look, about that... (awkward beat) My-name isn't really Johnny Fountain.

JESSICA (CONT'D): ...but I am going to, aren't I?
GREER: Up to you. Your husband left a message asking you to meet him in left field. Where's that?
JESSICA: What?   I don't understand--?
GREER: --A base ball field !? Wh ich o ne does he mean?!
JESSICA: (choking out the words) I... I don't know what you want me to say. I swear--
GREER: Shut up!!! Which field?! He wouldn't leave a message that didn't make sense to you!
JESSICA: Wait! The bleachers behind left field at Dodger Stadium! That's where we first met.
JESSICA (CONT'D): Please! Believe me. That has to be where he means. I swear to God.
GREER: Working in my profession as long as I have, you begin to recognize the truth when you hear it.
GREER (CONT'D): (turning back) Go to the window, Jessica. There's something I want you to see.
JESSICA: Ricky!
HODGES: Shoot hoops.
RICKY: I..   I don't feel like it.
HODGES: (threatening) Shoot.

JESSICA: Please God, I swear that's the truth. Don't kill my son!
GREER: (looking impressed) Most people don't get past two.
HODGES: Okay, kid.     Let's go.
JESSICA: You won't get away with this. When I didn't show up at the hospital, someone must have called the police--
GREER: The police are the last people on earth I'm worried about...
GREER (VO): We get one hit on the scanner about you, we'll be picking out family plots, comprende?
JESSICA: Do you honestly expect me to believe we're going to walk away from this alive?
GREER: (to Jessica) Shut up.

JESSICA (VO): I'm okay.
RYAN: What are you doing?    Why'd you lie to them?
JESSICA: (welling up with tears) Do you think I like gambling with my son's life?
RYAN: I can't tell. You seem pretty good at it --
JESSICA: Don't you see, Ryan? Once they get Craig, we're all gonna die.
RYAN: You can't know that for sure.
JESSICA: Be realistic. Does letting us live benefit them in any way? No! The only chance he's got is if you can get to the airport and find him before they do.
RYAN: Wait, wait--!
JESSICA: Ryan, please! There's no time! Just get to the airport--
RYAN: It's suicide. They'll kill me!
J...      JESSICA: They won't! You're invisible to them! They don't know who you are. They don't know anything about you. Please! You've got to try!
RYAN: Lady, I've jacked two cars, been accused of being a child molester, obliterated a car dealership, and busted three caps in a Verizon store. -- Don't tell me I'm not trying!
JESSICA: Look, I have no right to ask you this Ryan, but you re my family's only chance...and I am asking.

ATTRACTIVE WOMAN (VO): We're in the middle of a shit storm, and I need you to put a leash put on an officer.
DEEP MALE VOICE: Who?
ATTRACTIVE WOMAN (VO): An Officer Mooney from your division. Know him?
DEEP MALE VOICE: Mooney? He's a desk sergeant.      What would you want with him?
ATTRACTIVE WOMAN (VO): I had to do a B snooping around the house looking for the owner.
DEEP MALE VOICE: And what did you say?
ATTRACTIVE WOMAN (VO): That I was her, of course.
DEEP MALE VOICE: Did he believe you?
ATTRACTIVE   WOMAN   (VO): I think so. He said he thought someone was pulling a prank on him.
DEEP MALE VOICE: Mooney doing an investigation? What's are you really up to?
DETECTIVE TOMLIN: And no bullshit. Right now you're entire department's hot, so if I'm gonna get in the tub, I've got to know how deep it is.
JESSICA (VO): Where are you now?!
RYAN: I'll be at the airport in twenty minu --
JESSICA (VO): Twenty minutes! Oh my God, Ryan, you've got to drive faster! Please--
RYAN: (snapping) Jessica, this car has a sewing machine for an engine! I can't go any faster!
JESSICA: Sorry.   I just...
RYAN: Jessica... ?
JESSICA: Do you think God will forgive me?
RYAN: What do you mean--?
JESSICA: For what I've done...   For giving up Craig...
RYAN: Jessica, they have your kid. You had no choice.
JESSICA: I don't know. I don't know...
RYAN: 1 know. I heard what they were doing to you over there. You held out for as long as you could.
JESSICA: (grim beat) My son and I are going to die here, Ryan. They already have us. But maybe I could've saved Craig...
RYAN: Jessica, listen to me. I promise you, I'm not going to let that happen. I could care less about your money. I'm risking my life cause I know I'm gonna get you and your family out of this. You hear what I'm sayin'?
BRITISH ASSHOLE (VO): -- Yeah, the show just bought me a Cadillac XLR convertible. No, you can't ride in it. Not until you do something with that road kill you call hair. And what's with your makeup? Kabuki Theatre is not in style --
RYAN: (interrupting) Jessica? Are you still there?
BRITISH ASSHOLE (VO): Hey, hey?!    This is a private call!
JESSICA (VO): (washed in static) I'm..ere, but y...reaking up!
BRITISH ASSHOLE (VO): Get off my line! Are you there? Mom? I
RYAN: Listen dude, this woman's in serious --
BRITISH ASSHOLE (VO): --That's not my problem, lady.
RYAN: (yelling over the static) Jessica, don't hang up! You hear me?! Whatever happens --
BRITISH ASSHOLE (VO): Look woman, tell your kidnapping story to someone who gives a shit.
RYAN: Jessica?!     Jessica?!
RYAN (CONT'D): Gotcha.
SIMON COWELL (VO): (over Ryan's cellphone) Murdered your housekeeper? Don't bullshit me; I work in the Industry that invented it you stupid COW!
RYAN: Give me that phone... or I shoot your car!
RYAN: Ain't that a bitch!
RYAN (CONT'D): Out of the car! Now!
RYAN (CONT'D): Where's your phone?!
SIMON COWELL: It's on speaker!
RYAN: Jessica?
JESSICA (VO): Ryan?!    I'm here!
SIMON COWELL: Your career's over!    YOU HEAR ME?!
JESSICA (VO): (still shaken) I thought they... I thought I was--
RYAN: You're okay. It's okay now.
RYAN (INTO PHONE): I'm here... Oh shit!
JESSICA (VO): What?
RYAN: Your car's here.
JESSICA (VO): Hurry, Ryan! Just find Craig!
JESSICA (CONT'D): Wait, Ryan! What about me--?!
RYAN: Oops. Excuse me. Pardon me. My grandmother needs her walker...
DETECTOR OPERATOR: Excuse me, sir. Would you mind emptying your pockets over here?
DETECTOR OPERATOR (CONT'D): Code red!     Code red!
ELLIS: (reaching for something) Wait, this is a mistake--
PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM: Attention travelers. Due to a security problem, all persons are required to clear the terminal and return immediately to the security checkpoint at the entrance to Concourse B...
JESSICA (VO): "Left Field" is in Terminal C.
RYAN: Listen to me! They're clearing the terminal. Before your husband passes me, what does he look like?
JESSICA (VO): He's thirty-eight. Six feet.     Trim build. Thinning hair...
RYAN: (scanning the passengers) That's not enough! What's he wearing?
JESSICA (VO): I don't know! We have completely different schedules. I was fast aslee p-- (thinking it through) -- A suit... He wears glasses, thick rims, like Buddy Holly or--
RYAN: Found him!
NATIONAL GUARDSMAN: You can't be here now. You have to leave the area.
RYAN: But --
NATIONAL GUARDSMAN: Now, sir.
YOUNG GUARDSMAN: Hey, this one's on the job.
RYAN: Holy shit, Jessica, these guys are cops!
JESSICA (VO): What?!
SUPERIOR OFFICER: Run it. (the Guardsman runs off; turns back to Greer) Is that your gun?
GREER: (hesitates) --yes. Yes. It's my piece.
SUPERIOR OFFICER: Well, you're supposed to declare it.
GREEK: I know. We just got focused on a rabbit we're here to nab.
YOUNG GUARDSMAN: He's clean. Badge matches his I.D.
SUPERIOR OFFICER: (grumbles) Unhook 'em. Stand down security.
RYAN: (noticing; to Guard) Hey, can I go now? Can I go?!
CRAIG: Hey, what the hell?!    Get your hands off m--!!
RYAN: Shut up and keep walking. If they see us they'll kill us both.
CRAIG: What--?
RYAN: Your wife sent me.
CRAIG: She did?   But how--?
RYAN: Would you hurry your ass?! You need to hide. They're here, and they're looking for you. They already have your family.
RYAN (CONT'D): In here!
CRAIG: I don't understand--
RYAN: It's okay. She'll explain it to you. (into phone) Okay, Jessica, I'm handing you over now.
JESSICA: (welling up) Ryan, you've done so much.     I don't know how to repay you...
RYAN: Forget about the cash. Just get you and y9ur son home safely and we'll call it even.
JESSICA: I will.   I promise.
RYAN (VO): I know you will.
RYAN (CONT'D): I'm gonna be outside this door. Don't come out unless I get you. Got it?
CRAIG: (confused) Okay.
ELLIS: (sotto voce) Nice move. What the hell you bring a gun for?
GREEK: I didn't.
ELLIS: (sounding nervous) What do you mean?
GREER: Just keep your eyes open! Something weird is going on.
CRAIG (CONT'D): This isn't my wife.
CRAIG (CONT'D): My wife's name is Patty. I'm not Craig. I'm Paul. Paul Boyd.
RYAN: Shit!
GREEK: Make a scene and you'll never see your family again. Now who's here with you?
CRAIG: Who, what?... No one!   Nobody!
GREER: Answer me!
CRAIG: I'll forget I saw anything, just leave them alone!
GREER: For your family's sake, you better not have done anything stupid.
CRAIG: You goddamn animals better not have hu rt --
GREER: Animals?
MARILYN: Yes. He said you looked distracted when you left. He wants you to relax, Bob. He said they found that kid you were looking for and that you were right, it was all a prank. Nothing to worry about.
MOONEY: Yeah, I know.
MARILYN: What am I gonna do with you?
MOONEY: You're gonna dance with me all night long, until we're too pooped to pop... Well almost.
MARILYN: You'll never change.
MOONEY: Yes I will, after I shower.
MARILYN: Lame ass.   Come on.
GREER: Get out!
CRAIG: Goddamn it, what the hell are you people going to--
JESSICA (OS): Craig?
CRAIG: Jessica?
JESSICA: No, don't hurt him!
CRAIG: Ricky...?
CRAIG (CONT'D): Oh, God, Jess... What have they done to you?
JESSICA: Who are they, Craig?
JESSICA (CONT'D): Tell them, Craig. Tell them they have the wrong family. Tell them they've made a mistake--
JESSICA (CONT'D): What?!      What is it?
GREEK: Where is the disc now?
CRAIG: You have to promise. If I give it to you... you'll let my family go.
GREER: I'll tell you what, you tell me where it is-- (turns his gun on Jessica) --and I won't blow her brains all over you right now.
GREEK (CONT'D): Your call Craig. It's an eighty-five ''cent bullet to me.
CRAIG: Okay. Enough, you win.      But if anything-
GREER: (training gun on Craig) Just shut up and talk.
CRAIG (V.O.): I dropped it down the mail chute at work. It's gotta be in the mailroom.
JESSICA (VO): (for Ryan's benefit, weakly) You hid it downtown?
RYAN: Change of plans.      I need to get to downtown fast.
GREEK: Get up.     We're going.
CRAIG: How will I know she's okay?
HODGES: (shoving him) Move!
JESSICA: Wait!   WAIT!!
CRAIG: I love you.
JESSICA: (quickly; sotto voce) Pretend I'm telling you that I love you. There's an open phone line in here. You'll have help at the office, but if you give these men what they want, we're dead.
GREER: Let's go.
JESSICA: Ryan?! They're going to Fegan Securities, 4th and Figuroa.
RYAN (INTO PHONE): I'm already on my--
RYAN (CONT'D): You've gotta be kidding me! (to cabbie) Can't you back it up?
RYAN (CONT'D): Aw, screw this!
JESSICA (V.O.): Wait, we --(bzzt!)--ve to think! What --(bzzt!)--re we going to do?
RYAN: I have an idea...
MARILYN: In five minutes, I'll need you to give me a hand.
MOONEY: Whenever you're ready, hon.
NEWS ANCHOR: ...and authorities are now asking your help in identifying this man--
NEWS ANCHOR (CONT'D): -- believed to be responsible for today's bizarre string of crimes, most notably the theft of an $80,000 Cadillac at gunpoint.
MOONEY: What..?
OPERATOR: Thank you for using Pacbell. This is Claire, how may I help you?
MOONEY: I need the phone number for a residence. Jessica Martin in Brentwood.
OPERATOR: That number is (310) 555-8364.    For an extra seventy five cents-
JESSICA'S VOICE  (VO): Hi, you've reached the hom  e of Craig and Jessica Martin.   We can't get to the phone right now  , but if you leave your name and a   message--
MOONEY: (to an oblivious Marilyn) The woman at the house didn't have an accent.
MOONEY (CONT'D): I'm sorry honey( but I have to check on something real quick.
MARILYN: You've got to be kidding-
MOONEY: Delay the reservation if you have to; I'll be back in twenty minutes.
MARILYN: Twenty minutes my foot.
GREER: (re: .38 Special) Keep your eyes open.
MAILROOM SUPERVISOR: (recognizing Craig) Anything I can help you with Mr. Martin?
CRAIG: Hey, Benny. This might sound ridiculous, but I dropped a DVD mailer into the chute this morning and I forgot to put down an address.
MAILROOM SUPERVISOR: Happens all the time. Let me see what's back there. Gimme a sec'.
MAIL CLERK ,: Excuse me, sir? Sir? Sir?
RYAN: Me?
MAIL CLERK: You waiting for a package?
RYAN: (facing away) Sure, uh... I'm supposed to pick something up for Mr. Fountain over at the Bonaventure.
MAIL CLERK: From what department?
RYAN: I'm not sure... They said it was a contract, though, I know that, so what would that be, Legal?
MAIL CLERK: What's the tracking number?
RYAN: (patting himself down) Uh... Right. Tracking number.
MAILROOM SUPERVISOR: Mr. Martin? I found a number of things that could be what you're looking for. Mind coming back to take a look?
CRAIG: Sure.
RYAN: (patting himself) I might... Maybe it's on the clipboard on my bike?
RYAN (CONT'D): I, uh, may need to call somebody.
MAILROOM SUPERVISOR: Help yourself.
CRAIG: This is it.
HODGES: Let's go.
RYAN: You believe this? Everyone's got their head up their ass over there.
MAIL CLERK: (impatiently) Sir? You think you could just go outside and get your clipboard?
MAIL CLERK (CONT'D): Sir?
MAIL CLERK (CONT'D): Sir!?
RYAN: (to Clerk) Screw the package.
GREER: (flashing his badge)
CRAIG: ..run...
CRAIG (CONT'D): ..ruuuUUUUNNNNNN!!
RYAN: Damn!
HODGES: The kid!!
GREER: No shit.
GUARD: (racing down the hall) This way!
GREER: (to Hodges) Here.
GREER (CONT'D): Dammit!
JESSICA (VO): Ryan... ? Ryan, please answer me I
JESSICA: You have to talk to me! Ryan, please you have to talk to me--.'
JESSICA: Ryan?!    OH MY GOD, RYAN?!   RYAN--?!
JESSICA: Don't hurt me, and I'll do anything... Anything.. . There is a promise in what Jessica offers that Deason responds to. His fist FLASHES toward her throat, making her flinch. But rather than hitting her, he wraps his meaty fingers around her throat, almost daring her to stop him. Jessica trembles, but that is all, and just as Deason begins to enjoy his work, Jessica JABS at his face, but he predicted as much and easily moves to deflect it -- SNICKK! -- she flicks her wrist up and SLICES the underside of his upper arm. Deason flinches a little bit, like a bee sting, then laughs as he notices the tiny SHARD in her hand--
DEASON: (sarcastic) Oooh. --but that's when he HEARS it. A DRIPPING SOUND. Deason looks down at his arm and is confused to see his entire shirt sleeve SOAKED IN BLOOD. It literally pours from his arm onto the floor like a river. Deason drains white; dizzy.      He looks at Jessica, confused.
JESSICA: Brachial artery. Pumps up to 30 liters of blood per minute...and there's only five liters in the human body. Three seconds later, Deason crumbles...and Jessica leaves the attic.
GREER: (into walkie) The kid's outside, headed toward the front of the building--
HODGES: -Gotta go, boss. The Guard's dead.
COPS: Who the hell's shooting up here?
GREER: Sonofabitch shot the poor bastard right in front of us!
RICKY: Mom!
JESSICA: Baby!   Are you okay?!
RICKY: I can't get out!
MOONEY: (calling into house) Hello? L.A.P.D. Anybody home?
MOONEY: Drop your gun, now.   I got you.
MOONEY (CONT'D): I said drop it.'
MOONEY: Damn it!   DAMN IT!!
BAYBACK: ..a-ambulance...
MOONEY: Tell me where Jessica Martin is or you bleed to death right here.
BAYBACK: ..p-please..call.. I.. I'm a--
BAYBACK: ...I'm a cop...
MOONEY: Oh shit...
MOONEY (CONT'D): Request emergency back up and medical units! Officers down at-
RYAN: Ho - shit!
RICKY: Faster Mom!
JESSICA: (to Ricky) Get down! Get down!
GREER: These are the best pictures you could get of him?!
ELLIS: He was wearing a visor.
GREER: Useless!
JESSICA: (to son; through window) Baby, listen to me. I want you to get away from this window. I want you to go to the other side of the room as far away from the door as you can --
RICKY: No, don't leave me!     Don't leave me!!
JESSICA: Honey, I'm getting you out of there!
RICKY: Where are you going?!
JESSICA: I'm only gonna be gone a second, and then we're gonna go home, but you have to do this first. It's gonna be loud, but don't be scared, okay? Now go find somewhere safe like I told you.
PARAMEDIC #1: You're lucky. Shot went clean through. A few inches either way...
DETECTIVE TOMLIN: What the hell, Moon? It's all over the radio.
MOONEY: Jack, she didn't identify herself.
DETECTIVE TOMLIN: What are you saying?
MOONEY: I shot a cop! (lowering his voice) Dana Bayback. From the 23rd.     She was one of the kidnappers.
DETECTIVE TOMLIN: Let me call the tw9~three. See what the hell's going on.
MOONEY: I hate to think more cops are involved, but--
DETECTIVE TOMLIN: Did she say anything about the Martin woman?
MOONEY: ...Never got the chance.
SIMON COWELL: Just give me my goddamned car!
JADED CASHIER: Don't take that tone of voice with me, sir. I've already told you, we do not release vehicles until all impound fees are paid.
SIMON COWELL: But I didn't cause it to get impounded! Can't you understand that?! It was stolen from me!
JADED CASHIER: Sir, do you want the car back or not?
SIMON COWELL: Yes!     But I'm not paying for it!
JADED CASHIER: Nevermind, Howie. Take 'er back.
SIMON COWELL: Wait, wait! All right you bloody fascist, I'll pay. But if there's even the slightest scratch on it...
SIMON COWELL (CONT'D): Hey, that's my car!
SIMON COWELL (CONT'D): NOooooooo...!!
RYAN: Thank you!
RYAN: I'm so screwed.
HODGES (OS): Boss, you better take this.
GREER: What?
RYAN: Shut up and listen to me, asswipe. I got what you want.
MALE VOICE (VO): Who is this?
RYAN: You know who this is, shithead!
TELEMARKETER: Look, sir, we can take your name off our list if you want, but you don't have to get nasty--
RYAN (VO): What--?    Who is this?
TELEMARKETER: Mark.     At Mastercharge Credit Union-
RYAN (VO): just hit "Last Incoming Call"--
RYAN (VO) (CONT'D): You bastard.
TOMLIN (VO): Look, Captain, we've got to do everything we can to protect this guy. I mean, shit, with all his years in he's owed a little.
GREER VO: He's with you? How'd he find out?
TOMLIN: Said something about a kid who came into the station earlier--
GREER: Early twenties? Stumbled out of Brian Wilson's hamper?
TOMLIN: Yeah.   Something like that.
GREER: Tomlin. Take care of him.      No witnesses.
TOMLIN: Are you sure that's necessary, sir?
GREER: You know once the shitstorm starts, there's nothing I can do to save you.
TOMLIN: Sure. That's what I thought.        I'll tell him.
PARAMEDIC #1: Keep pressure on it until you get it stitched.
MOONEY: What's the word?
TOMLIN: Not g9od. I.A.'s not throwing out any lifelines with all that's going on.. . (re: Mooney's sh9ulder) Come on. You can write a statement while I take you to the hospital.
HODGES: Well?   What'd he say?
GREER: You know a desk jockey named Mooney?
JESSICA (CONT'D): Baby, please! It's okay now. We're gonna go home! (glances back nervously) Ricky, please!
ELLIS: Get out of the car!    Get out of the goddamned car!!
JESSICA: Come on!    COME ON!!
JESSICA: Nobody!
RICKY: Stop it!   Don't hurt her!!
GREER: Bad timing, Tomlin.
RYAN (VO): Feel like a trade?
GREER: The mysterious bike messenger.   How did you get this number?
RYAN: Gotta love modern technology... My new phone knows the numbers of the last fifty incoming calls.
GREER: What do you want?
RYAN: Just the woman and her kid.
GREER: Who are you? What's your name?
RYAN: My name is F you. I've got your shit, pal, it doesn't work that way.
GREEK: Really? (turns to Ellis) Go cut the kid's throat.
RYAN: Fine.     Your loss.   Nice talking to you.
RYAN (CONT'D): Ring.     C'mon, damn it, ring!   RING!
GREER: So, how do you want to do this?
RYAN: Put on a big ass Ronald McDonald smile, apologize to the kid and the woman and bring 'em to the Santa Monica pier.
GREER (VO): No.     Somewhere quieter.
RYAN: Dude, you're lucky I'm still talkin' to your sorry ass. You do as I say, exactly as I say, or I hang up now and slap this bitch on Nightline, you know what I'm sayin'?
GREER (VO): Fine.    But you come alone.
RYAN: Done.
GREER (VO): How will I recognize you?
RYAN: You let me worry about that. What's your cell number?
GREER (VO): (310) 555-8342. An hour then?
RYAN: I can hardly wait.
MOONEY: (to Tomlin) Shouldn't we be on Pico?
TOMLIN: County will have a six hour wait. Ten if they know you're a cop.
TOMLIN (CONT'D): Yeah?
GREER (OS): Is it taken care of?
TOMLIN: Not yet.
GREER (OS): Good. We're making a trade with the kid at the Santa Monica Pier. Your boy can ID the kid for us. Bring him down.
TOMLIN: (relieved) I'm on it.
TOMLIN (CONT'D): We caught a break with the kid. He's been spotted on the pier. Think you can hang on a little longer? Just enough to ID the kid before we patch you up?
TOMLIN (CONT'D): Whaddaya say? Up to you.
MOONEY: Let's solve the goddamn thing.
ENVIOUS COLLEGE KID: Lucky bastard...
RYAN: You like it? (tosses him the keys) Happy Birthday.
HODGES: I'm in position.
GREEK: Copy.
GREER: Only take the kid out if it's clean. No guess work. The last thing we need's a stampede.
GREER (CONT'D): You here?
RYAN (VO): Yeah.
GREER: How do you want to do this?
RYAN (VO): First show me that Jessica and the kid are okay.
GREER: Do you have the disc?
RYAN (VO): Yes.     Where are they?
GREER: See the black van at the bottom of the bridge? Passenger side window.
RYAN (VO): Hang on. (beat) Okay, got it.
GREER: He's within visual of the car.
GREEK (INTO WALKIE) (CONT'D): Hodges, show the woman. Lower the passenger side window only.
GREER (INTO PHONE): Did you see that?
RYAN (VO): Yes.
GREER: He's around the passenger side. Have you found him yet?
ELLIS (VO): No. (throws his photos) I don't know what the hell he looks like!
GREER: He's the one on the cellphone, you idiot 1
ELLIS (VO): Everyone's on a cellphone! I've got like fifty possible targets here!
GREER: Your turn.    Now you show me something.
RYAN (VO): No. Put them on the Ferris wheel. I want to see them safe first.
GREER: That wasn't part of the deal.
RYAN (VO): Deal's changed.
RYAN (VO): I've been thinking. Does me no good to hand over the DVD and then you and the funky bunch take us out.
GREER (VO): I swore I wouldn't do that.
RYAN: Like you swore to protect and serve? The reference brings Greer up short.       There's a moment, then:
GREER: You know a lot...
RYAN: And I'll forget a lot, too. But not until they're both out of danger. Now PAN AROUND TO REVEAL Ryan among the crowd, wearing a SURFING WINDBREAKER; HOODED with WATERPROOF POCKETS -- but where's his cellphone? Moving closer, we see Ryan's wearing the EARBUD MIKE from the Verizon store. With the earbud concealed under the loose hood, Ryan looks like anyone else just watching the show.
RYAN (CONT'D): Your choice, man. The Martins or the DVD. Either way, I'm not hanging around any longer. You got five seconds, then I disconnect your ass.
GREEK: You sure you know what you're doing?
RYAN: One...     Two...
RYAN: Three...    Four...
GREER: Okay! Okay. (into walkie) Hodges, put 'em on the Ferris wheel.
HODGES (VO): What? I
GREER: Shut up and do it!
RYAN: Not bad. Most people never get past two.
GREER: (to Ellis) Keep an eye on them. As soon as we make the trade, take the woman and her kid out.
GREER (VO): Don't screw me kid, y9u won't live long enough to enjoy it.
RYAN: Oooh, I think I just pissed myself.
CHLOE: There you are! Where the hell were you! ?
RYAN: Chloe!    Get away from here!
CHLOE: Know how many hours I waited for you to bring back those stupid shirts?! What'd you do? Sell them on the Prominade yourself--?
MOONEY: (motioning to Tomlin) That's him! There he is!
RYAN: It isn't safe to talk, get it? I -- People are after me!
CHLOE: (shrugs free) What -- are you high?
MOONEY: (winded) I've been..looking for..you, kid--
RYAN: Let go of me! Sonofabitch, let go!
GREER (OVER WALKIE): Hodges, do not let them go! Do you hear me? Do not let them go!
MOONEY: (sweating profusely) Jesus, kid, calm down!!
CHLOE: Oh my God-- (checking Mooney) Someone call 911!
TOMLIN: It's over kid.
TOMLIN (CONT'D): For all the trouble you've caused, you'd better have that goddamned disc. Where is it?
RYAN: Aw shit...
CROWD GOER (OS): Dude's gotta gun!
GREER: Under the pier. Go! Go!
RYAN: (to himself) Think! Think!
CHLOE: You better lie still. The paramedics should be here shortly.
MOONEY: Just keep that ambulance close by.
TOMLIN: You're wounded kid, just give me what I came for, and I'll let you all go.
TOMLIN: Shoulda stayed at home this morning, kid.
^_        RYAN (OS): Funny. I was about to say the same to you.
TOMLIN: What the--
HODGES: Tomlin? Anyone copy?
ELLIS: Got him.   He's in the parking lot.
ELLIS (OS): I've got a clean shot.
GREEK (OS): No! We don't have the DVD. Just hold his location. Hodges, parking lot now!
JESSICA: Ricky run!    Find help!
ELLIS (OS): He's heading for the cops.       We should do it now.
MOONEY: ""Freeze! Drop your weapon!
GREEK: No more bullshit!     Just give me the goddamn disc!
GREER (CONT'D): This is about to be the most enjoyable part of an extremely shitty day.
JESSICA: Tell me why I shouldn't kill you.
RYAN: Jess... Jessica?     Don't.
JESSICA: I... I have to.
MOONEY (O.S.): Lower the weapon, Jessica.
MOONEY (CONT'D): (trying to reason with her) Ricky's safe. It's all going to be okay. Put it down. Jessica slowly lowers the gun and looks into Ryan's face.
JESSICA: Thank you for keeping your promise. As the cops move in and drag Greer to his feet, Ryan calls out to him.
RYAN: Hey man, your shitty day is about to get a whole lot shittier. Ryan flips open his phone and on the SCREEN plays the SECURITY FOOTAGE of the murder in the parking lot. We see that Ryan must've copied the DVD with his videophone.
RYAN (CONT'D): Ain't that a bitch? And through the tears, Jessica manages a laugh. A small one. But enough to let us know everything's going to be okay. And as we PULL BACK on the scene--
NEWS ANCHOR: ...The Santa Monica Pier was the latest setting in the ongoing 23rd Precinct corruption scandal. Ryan Ackerman, a local resident, risked his life to save a family kidnapped by officers to cover up... Chloe strokes Ryan's scalp with her fingers.
CHLOE: """How does it feel to be a hero?
RYAN: (re: his wounds) It hurts... But you're making it way better. I'm just glad it's over.
CHLOE: (smiling) Modesty can be sexy.
RYAN: And to think this was our first date.
CHLOE: Next time, skip the shower.
JESSICA: Craig's very weak, but the doctors say it looks promising. He's probably going to have to walk with a cane, but that's the worst of it... I'm just thankful.
CHLOE: Come on Ricky, let's get a hot chocolate.
JESSICA: I can't believe I almost lost everything that means... I don't know how I can ever thank you.
RYAN: I do. (weak smile) Don't ever call me again.
