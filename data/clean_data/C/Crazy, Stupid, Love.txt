ROBBIE: Close the door!
JESSICA: ( THROUGH DOOR )
LIZ: I don't know, Hannah. Your life is just so. PG-13. Hannah's mouth drops open.
HANNAH: My life is not PG-13!
LIZ: It so is. You've never left LA. You pass the bar you're gonna be, what, a patent lawyer, probably married to that snooze-fest Richard. I just worry about you is all. Hell, you've resorted to fantasizing about Conan `Ginger- Dick' O'Brien.
HANNAH: ( ADORABLE )
LIZ: He looks like a carrot, honey. Hannah LAUGHS.
LIZ: Hi. Who looks like a carrot?
JACOB: Hi. Who looks like a carrot?
LIZ: Conan O'Brien. My friend Hannah thinks he's sexy.
JACOB: I think your friend Hannah is Hannah LAUGHS.
HANNAH: You didn't really just say that.
JACOB: Pretty sure I did.
HANNAH: How old are you?
JACOB: Thirty-three next month.
HANNAH: Then you should know by now that cheesy pick-up lines don't work. Jacob sits down at their table, uninvited.
JACOB: I find you incredibly sexy. It's a fact, not a cheesy pick-up line.
HANNAH: I don't.
JACOB: Yes you do.
LIZ: Yes, she does.

HANNAH: You've got to be kiddi
JACOB: We'll make love and it will be amazing. You'll laugh afterwards and say `I never do this kind of thing.' Then you'll do it again.
HANNAH: Is that so?
JACOB: It is. So now I'm going to ask if I can buy you another drink. If you say yes, we'll have one more cocktail each just enough to start losing inhibitions, not enough to get sloppy, after all: I promised to satisfy you.
LIZ: Multiple times.
JACOB: That's right. So, here we go, Hannah: can I buy you a drink? Hannah and Liz share a look.
HANNAH: What do you expect me to say to Margarita, rocks, salt.
JACOB: Margarita, rocks, salt.
HANNAH: She STANDS, grabs her coat and Liz's hand.

TRACY: Okay, you're not talking and you know that only makes me talk more. Maybe that's good, maybe that's good. Okay.
TRACY: We've been spending time together. Lunches, meetings, that kind of Silence. She closes her eyes tightly.
TRACY: I slept with him. Kind of. Tracy opens one eye, taking a peek. Nothing.
TRACY: No, no kind of. I can't believe I said kind of. That's just not something you do in a kind of way. I slept with someone. There. I said it. I slept with someone. Oh God.

CAL: Please stop.
TRACY: The last person in the world I'd ever want to hurt was you, Cal
CAL: If you keep talking, I'm going to get out of the car.
TRACY: But the fact that I did, that it could happen at all, I think it just shows how broken we are and
CAL: Just like that, Cal OPENS THE DOOR to the moving car and, simply, steps out. Tracy SCREAMS as Cal goes flying. She screeches to a stop as he tumbles to the curb in her rearview mirror.
TRACY: Are you out of your mind!? He looks up at her, pleading.
CAL: I'll leave tonight, I'll sign whatever you want me to sign, if you'll just stop talking about it. She touches his bloody forehead, affectionate. There's still something here.
TRACY: He stands, limps back to the car.
CAL: He stands, limps back to the car.
ROBBIE: I'm sorry that you had to see She keeps staring straight ahead.
JESSICA: I should have knocked.
ROBBIE: For the record: I think about you while I do it
JESSICA: I have a picture of you and I look at it the whole time
ROBBIE: I have a picture of you and I look at it the whole time
JESSICA: Stop it!
ROBBIE: I love you, Jessica. And I know you're seventeen, and I know I just turned thirteen, which is the same age as your little brother, and you're technically my baby- sitter, but someday soon our age difference will be inconsequential which is good because.
JESSICA: I'm pretty sure you're my She stops, looks at him and smiles gently.
ROBBIE: I'm pretty sure you're my She stops, looks at him and smiles gently.
ROBBIE: I'm pretty sure you're my She stops, looks at him and smiles gently.
JESSICA: Listen, Robbie
ROBBIE: Jessica jumps off the couch.
JESSICA: Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Weaver. How was Oh my God, Mr. Weaver, you're bleeding. Why are you bleeding?
CAL: Mrs. Weaver told me she wants a divorce so I jumped out of the car. Hope the kids behaved. Come on, I'll drive you home. Robbie steps INTO FRAME.
ROBBIE: Oh. I didn't know you were here.
CAL: Oh. I didn't know you were here.
ROBBIE: You're getting divorced?

CAL: ( THEN )
JESSICA: 10 INT. LEXUS SUV - LATER 10
CAL: We'll talk to the kids tomorrow. Tell them we're separating. Just separating. We'll do it together. He thinks.
CAL: I'll have to tell Nanna. Uch, she's gonna be crushed. But not right now. She's got enough to worry about. He trails off. Another long beat of silence, then he remembers his company and turns toward Jessica.
CAL: ( WITH ENERGY )
JESSICA: ( THEN )
CAL: David Jacobowitz! Are you kidding me!? DAVID FUCKING JACOBOWITZ!
CAL: Sorry about that.
JESSICA: It's okay. Jessica reaches for the door, but stops. She takes a deep breath, adorable.
JESSICA: Mr. Weaver, I know you don't know me very well, but I've been baby- sitting for your family for three years. You're the nicest dad of any of the families I baby-sit for, by a country mile.
JESSICA: In fact and, I hope this doesn't make you uncomfortable I think I've even developed a
LITTLE CRUS: ( NOT LISTENING )
CAL: ( NOT LISTENING )
JESSICA: That's my girl. Jessica awkwardly gets out of the car.
CAL: That's my girl. Jessica awkwardly gets out of the car.
CAL: Hey, Jessica? Thanks for She smiles, turns back. She freezes when she sees. He's holding CASH out the window to pay her.
CAL: You put this to that fake ID you'll need up at Stanford. And with a sad wink, he drives off leaving her standing there, lovelorn and forty-five dollars richer.
BARTENDER: Another vodka cranberry?
CAL: Yes. Just. yes. A GIRL ( 30s ) approaches the bar. Cal taps her shoulder, a drunken train-wreck waiting to happen.
CAL: Guess what?
GIRL: My wife is having intercourse with someone who isn't me.
CAL: My wife is having intercourse with someone who isn't me.
GIRL: I'm sorry to hear that.
CAL: That's very nice of you to say. She just told me tonight, obviously it came as a bit of a shock and you're not listening The Girl has turned back to a group of friends.
CAL: I bet you wouldn't ignore me if I were David Jacobowitz. My wife doesn't ignore David Jacobowitz. ( to no one ) She screws him. Something catches Cal's eye across the bar. We PAN TO.
JACOB PALMER: wearing his two thousand dollar suit, he's now got TWO BEAUTIFUL WOMEN fawning over him at his table. Cal takes him in for a long beat, turns back to the bartender, and decides:
CAL: ( RE: JACOB )
WOMAN: So it's pretty no-frills. Unit 2 is a lot like unit 1 except you're downstairs so. the ground is closer. Which is nice.
CAL: I guess the price is right.
WOMAN: Yeah, well, tons of divorced guys here. You'll fit right in. Cal SIGHS, un-enthused.
CAL: I'll take it.
WOMAN: Ooh, the gym has an elliptical machine. I assume you want to get back in shape? Cal looks down, embarrassed.
CAL: I guess.
WOMAN: Great! I'll let you know when they fix it.
BOSS: Cal, I just got the weekly sales report, good good good! You really killed this quarter!
CAL: Who told you Tracy and I were getting a divorce?
BOSS: ( RELIEVED )
CAL: I have to go buy furniture now. Cal stands, EXITS.
BOSS: Go for it! ( then, calling after ) It could have been cancer, buddy!
SALESMAN: Can I help you, sir?
CAL: My wife is sleeping with David Jacobowitz. I need a couch.
SALESMAN: Ooh, I understand. Can I give you a word of advice, one divorced man to another? If you don't mind?
CAL: Get the matching chaise, killer He pats the adjacent piece. Cal processes this.
SALESMAN: Get the matching chaise, killer He pats the adjacent piece. Cal processes this.
CAL: I want it in beige.
SALESMAN: I'll write you up.
CAL: Oh, no, I'm sorry, I'm waiting for a friend.
GUY: You've been holding the seat for an hour.
CAL: ( TOO LOUD )
CAL: Can't help but notice that you're always surrounded by women. Multiple women. Jacob doesn't even turn.
CAL: I'm getting divorced. Or, in the process. Gonna be single again. Any advice?
CAL: Any advice?
JACOB: ( CONTINUED ) 17 CONTINUED: 17
JACOB: Don't start conversations with people while they're pissing. He walks away, washes his hands, EXITS. A beat, then:
CAL: ( TO HIMSELF )
BERNIE: Sorry I'm late, I had to pick something up from Macy's.
CAL: Don't worry about it, here, sit, I've been guarding this stool with my life. Bernie sits, looks uncomfortable.
CAL: It's good to see you, man. I've called you a few times. It's been a rough couple of days, obviously. Nothing I could use more than my old pal Bernie to unload on. Hey, we should play racquetball, when's the last time we played Claire won't let me be friends with you anymore. Cal takes this in.
BERNIE: Claire won't let me be friends with you anymore. Cal takes this in.
CAL: I'm sorry, what?
BERNIE: She said we had to choose between you and Tracy. I chose you. She said no.
BERNIE: It's cologne.
CAL: Are you breaking up with me?
BERNIE: Claire's waiting in the car. Um. there's a gift receipt in there. Sorry. Bernie stands, awkwardly. He pats Cal on the shoulder, lingers a beat too long, then simply turns and EXITS. Cal is left alone. He raises a finger at the Bartender.
CAL: Do you have anything with a worm in it? Because I'd like a gallon of that now.
ON JACOB: Legs crossed, martini in hand, he's been watching Cal get dumped this whole time. He PANS UP from Cal's feet. The white sneakers. Bad navy blue dress socks. Dad khakis. An ill-fitting, untucked, dress shirt. Half-lidded eyes. Rumpled hair. Jacob shakes his head. Jesus Christ. He says something to THE WOMAN who currently sits at the table. She nods, gets up and walks away.
CAL: This is my youngest, Molly. Her two favorite things are High School Musical and her mother. I hate both of her two favorite A SHARP WHISTLE interrupts. Cal turns, sees Jacob. Jacob motions for Cal to come over. Every move Jacob makes is practiced, perfectly cool.
JACOB: Jacob Palmer.
CAL: CAL WEA
CAL WEA: I'd like to buy you a drink, Cal.
JACOB: I'd like to buy you a drink, Cal.
CAL: I already have a drink.
JACOB: Let me buy you a drink, Cal.
CAL: Jacob motions to the Bartender who NODS. Cal SITS.
CAL: My wife is cheating on me with
JACOB: David Jacobowitz, yes, Cal, I've heard. We've all heard. For the last two nights, I've watched you batter every poor soul in this bar with your sad-sack loser sob Cal takes this in. He STANDS.
CAL: You know what, I don't need this
CRAP: Sit down, Cal.
JACOB: Sit down, Cal.
CAL: Cal sits. Jacob's that powerful. Cal's that drunk.
JACOB: Cal, I'm going to make you an offer, it's probably the best offer you're ever going to get, and you're extremely drunk, so it's wildly important that you don't answer until I've finished and you've taken a few moments to process what I'm saying. Do you Cal goes to answer, Jacob holds up a finger. Cal stops himself. Once he's settled, Jacob continues:
JACOB: As I said, I've been watching you for two days now and I can say, without hesitation, that you are the sorriest man I've ever seen in my life don't interrupt, Cal, it's the truth, and you need to hear it. You're sitting there with your Supercut haircut, getting drunk on watered down vodka-cranberries like a fourteen- year-old girl, wearing a 41R jacket when you should be wearing a 40L I don't know if I want to help you or euthanize you stop drinking out of the goddamn straw, Cal. Cal stops drinking from the wimpy red straw.
JACOB: You asked me for advice before, Cal, so I'm going to help you. I don't know why. Maybe I'm just bored. Maybe all my friends have abandoned me for wives and children and labradoodle puppies, who cares why? Why doesn't matter. The point is, you've got a good face, and a good head of hair, and I'm bored as hell and need a project. So if you want, I'm going to help you rediscover your manhood. Do you remember when it was that you lost it? Cal shakes "no."
JACOB: Doesn't matter, we'll find it. And when we do, when I'm through with you, that wife of yours is going to rue the day she decided to give up on you too early. That's my offer. What do you say? Cal stares at him blankly. A long beat of silence. Cal goes for a drink, almost uses the straw. then catches himself. He puts down the drink. Looks up.
CAL: Yeah, okay.
JACOB: Mall food court, Thursday, six I'm sorry, what? Jacob downs his drink, nods at THE WOMAN ( now nearby ).
CAL: I'm sorry, what? Jacob downs his drink, nods at THE WOMAN ( now nearby ).
JACOB: You ready to go? She nods, subservient, and follows him out. Cal shakes his head, picks up his drink, and slurps the rest of his vodka cranberry out of the straw.
HIS BACKYARD: A weathered playground sits off to the side. You can tell it hasn't been used in quite some time. Baseball equipment lays all over, the site of many father-son catches. An oft-used barbecue next to the house. You can tell a lot about this family from seeing this backyard. You like this family a lot from seeing this TRACY ( O.S. ) Cal looks up. Tracy approaches. She's wearing sweats. It's pretty obvious that she's been crying. Awkward silence. Neither knows what to say.
TRACY: I just wanted to say that. Her voice cracks. She turns away.
TRACY: She gathers herself. Cal steps forward. Instinct tells him to comfort his wife but he can't anymore and he stops himself. She realizes this. There's something harsh and complicated about the reality of it all. Tracy looks at the U-HAUL, wipes her eyes and tries to lighten things.
TRACY: Do you want me to back that thing out of the driveway for you?
CAL: I'll be fine.
TRACY: You have trouble in reverse is It was two times
CAL: It was two times
TRACY: Three if you count my father's I did that on purpose.
CAL: I did that on purpose.
TRACY: I knew it. They smile, in rhythm for a moment. Then they realize, stop smiling. Cal turns awkwardly.
CAL: Once I'm settled, I'll get the kids so they can see the place. He walks to the truck. Tracy's voice stops him.
TRACY: I think I'm have a mid-life crisis maybe. Can women have mid-life Make sure the lawn gets enough In the movies it's always men having them and buying ridiculous yellow Porsches, but I'm not a man and I really don't want a yellow
CAL: ( AVOIDING ENGAGEMENT )
TRACY: In the movies it's always men having them and buying ridiculous yellow Porsches, but I'm not a man and I really don't want a yellow
PORSCHE: You have to fertilize once a month. Not twice a month, not once every two months. She takes a deep breath, finding her balance.
CAL: You have to fertilize once a month. Not twice a month, not once every two months. She takes a deep breath, finding her balance.
TRACY: We got married so young, Cal. And I'm forty-one. And that's so much older than I thought I'd be.
CAL: The sprinklers turn off behind And I got really upset with an umpire at Molly's t-ball game last month like really upset, like I screamed at him and wished he would die and I started feeling like the person I promised I wouldn't turn into, you know?
TRACY: And I got really upset with an umpire at Molly's t-ball game last month like really upset, like I screamed at him and wished he would die and I started feeling like the person I promised I wouldn't turn into, you know?
CAL: If it rains a lot, you need to shut off the automatic setting.
TRACY: And we haven't been us, not for a long time. And I don't know when you and I stopped being `us' but. I mean, do you? Cal finally turns and looks at her.
CAL: I think it was when you screwed David Jacobowitz. Ouch. Tracy's face registers the blow, but she nods: she also understands it.
CAL: Make sure my azaleas get enough Cal turns, gets in the U-HAUL, and backs out. And immediately crashes into the neighboring FENCE.
CAL: Okay, well, this is it. What do you think? Didn't have a lot of time to house-hunt, but. They look around his depressing, beige apartment. A pathetic TV plays the Disney Channel in the corner.
CAL: There's a second bedroom with twin beds so you two can stay over whenever you want! Anytime!
ROBBIE: So. you're like, actually going to live here? Molly looks like she's going to cry.
CAL: Hey, hey. Come on now, you'll visit all the time. Every weekend. It won't be that bad.
MOLLY: Don't you love us anymore? Cal takes Molly's face in his hands, starts tearing up.
CAL: Listen, baby. What's happening with your mommy and I. it's not what either of us wanted, not what either of us planned.
MOLLY: She bolts past Cal to the TV, where ZAC EFRON is on- screen, prancing about in a basketball uniform. Robbie and Cal stand there, awkwardly.
TROY!: She bolts past Cal to the TV, where ZAC EFRON is on- screen, prancing about in a basketball uniform. Robbie and Cal stand there, awkwardly.
ROBBIE: Don't take it personally. That show's like crack to her. Cal NODS.
ROBBIE: You okay?
CAL: Robbie shrugs.
ROBBIE: Can I say something with a curse? One time?
CAL: Yeah. Why not? Robbie NODS, takes a deep breath.
ROBBIE: Love is fucked. Cal LAUGHS, a bit of tension relieved.
CAL: Is that so? You in love, buddy?
ROBBIE: Well, if you must know
ROBBIE: What is she doing here?
CAL: Oh, right, hey, Jess, thanks for
COMING: ( MORE ) ( CONTINUED ) 20 CONTINUED: ( 2 ) 20 CAL ( CONT'D )
ROBBIE: ( CHANGING TOPICS )
CAL: ( CHANGING TOPICS )
JESSICA: ( CHANGING TOPICS )
CAL: Yes, well, that's a generous adjective, thank you.
ROBBIE: But I don't need a babysitter! She's only four years older than me! You need to know that! She needs to know that!
CAL: I know, buddy. Cal musses Robbie's hair.
CAL: My little boy's growing up, Jess. He's in love already, can you believe it? Uch. Robbie thumps the wall with his head, dying.
CAL: Molly, say bye-bye to Daddy? No response, she's glued to the television.
ROBBIE: Wait, where are you going?
CAL: I'm, uh. I decided to take a That's great, Mr. Weaver. It's a difficult time for you, it's important that you find new interests, try new things, maybe things you'd never have considered trying before. Cal looks down, Jessica has her hand on his shoulder. It's a bit odd. She realizes, takes it off.
JESSICA: That's great, Mr. Weaver. It's a difficult time for you, it's important that you find new interests, try new things, maybe things you'd never have considered trying before. Cal looks down, Jessica has her hand on his shoulder. It's a bit odd. She realizes, takes it off.
CAL: Okay, well. Molly, last chance!? But Molly is still locked on Efron.
CAL: That's my angel. Back in a few.
ROBBIE: But, Dad
CAL: The door slams. Robbie stands there with Jessica, awkward. Tries to maintain some semblance of cool.
ROBBIE: I don't need a baby-sitter.
JESSICA: I know, Robbie. An awkward beat, then.
ROBBIE: I love you so much
JESSICA: Jesus Christ.
CAL: What am I doing?
CAL: What the hell am I doing? He walks past a CHEESECAKE FACTORY. Inside is. Hannah ( girl from the bar who Jacob tried picking up ).
RICHARD: I think you're wrong. I think that's Tucker.
WHITE MAN: No, no, no. Chris Rock is the stand-up comedian. Chris Tucker is the actor.
WHITE WOMAN: Is it racist that I can't tell them apart? Liz nods her head "yes" at Hannah. Hannah stifles a LAUGH. Liz stands.
LIZ: Well, Richard: thank you for inviting me to Hannah's `goodbye' party. The conversation has been riveting, like stepping back in time. Before I go, a toast. She holds up her glass, toasting.
LIZ: Sweetie: go into your hole and study your cute little ass off for that bar exam. We'll see you when you emerge.
RICHARD: She's gonna kick that bar's butt! All the dorks CHEER. Liz SHRUGS.
LIZ: Yeah, okay.
HANNAH: ( SMILING )
RICHARD: Hey, Liz? When my girl passes, we're gonna have another little celebration, right here. Hope you can make it. It's going to be a special night.
LIZ: Richard, you just give me a heads- up so I can get really drunk before-hand, okay?
RICHARD: You know it! Hannah leads Liz out of the restaurant, WHISPERS:
HANNAH: Did you hear that? `It's going to be a special night.' You think he's going to propose?
LIZ: At the Cheesecake Factory? Oh God, I hope not.
HANNAH: He's nice.
LIZ: Yeah, well. Jesus. Really? ( with a shrug ) Okay. Not my life, I love you, call me if you need anything. Liz KISSES her goodbye, EXITS. Hannah looks at her table. Everyone is typing on their BLACKBERRIES. She SIGHS, heads to rejoin them.
JACOB: You're late. ( then, offering ) No thanks. So what exactly are
CAL: No thanks. So what exactly are
WE: How much money can you afford to spend on clothes today?
JACOB: How much money can you afford to spend on clothes today?
CAL: I dunno. Five hundred?
JACOB: Three thousand.
CAL: We'll start with shoes. Let me see those sneakers you're wearing. Cal holds up his foot.
JACOB: We'll start with shoes. Let me see those sneakers you're wearing. Cal holds up his foot.
JACOB: Take them off. Cal bends down, takes one off.
JACOB: ( CHEWING )
CAL: What the hell!?
JACOB: Are you in a fraternity, Cal?
CAL: Those were my favorite shoes.
JACOB: ARE YOU IN A FRATERNITY, CAL!? Are you Steve Jobs?
CAL: Are you Steve Jobs?
JACOB: Are you Steve Jobs?
CAL: ARE YOU THE BILLIONAIRE OWNER OF APPLE COMPUTERS? No. I'm not Steve Jobs.
JACOB: ARE YOU THE BILLIONAIRE OWNER OF APPLE COMPUTERS? No. I'm not Steve Jobs.
APPLE COMPUTERS?: No. I'm not Steve Jobs.
CAL: No. I'm not Steve Jobs.
JACOB: Then you don't need to walk around in New Balance Sneaker, ever. Let's go.
CAL: I think this whole thing might have been a bad idea. Jacob ignores him, grabs a pair of BLACK DRESS SHOES.
JACOB: Any man can rebuild his entire wardrobe with sixteen simple Ha! I think I read that in GQ.
CAL: Ha! I think I read that in GQ.
JACOB: You did. I wrote it.
CAL: Jacob CHUCKLES. Cal CHUCKLES back, clearly unsure what the chuckle symbolizes.
JACOB: Numbers one and two: pair of dress shoes, pair of loafers.
CAL: I'm sorry, I'm lost: do you really write for GQ? Jacob slaps Cal's hand, knocking the socks away.
JACOB: Your credit card please?
JACOB: Take it in there. and there.
CAL: These are two hundred and thirty dollars. Can't we just go to the He looks up. Jacob is gone.

CAL: What's wrong with the Gap?
JACOB: In Hell, every store is the Gap, that's what's wrong with the Gap, Cal. It's lowest common denominator. Be better than the fucking Gap, Cal.
CAL: I'm very warm.
JACOB: You rub this in around your eyes every night and every morning.
CAL: What does it do?
JACOB: ( SARCASTIC )
CAL: Oh my God, it does.
CAL: I like to use a number four on the sides and the back, go longer on the top.
JACOB: Oh, okay. Thanks for that, Vidal Sassoon. Tiffany, hon? Scissor cut, tight on sides, get him some texture up top, take off about. He touches Cal's hair, measures it between his fingers.
CAL: . inch off the top.
JACOB: . inch off the top.
TIFFANY: Yes, sir.
CAL: Tiffany starts chopping.
BUT: Tiffany starts chopping.
JACOB: What are you putting on?
JACOB: ( then, to Tiffany ) You smell great by the way.
TIFFANY: ( SMITTEN )
JACOB: What are you doing tonight?
TIFFANY: I don't know.
JACOB: That's okay, I do. She GIGGLES. Cal calls out.
JACOB: Yes, Cal, just like that.
JACOB TIFFANY: Yes. Yes.
TIFFANY: Can I blouse out the shirt a little? I like to blouse out my shirts a little.
JACOB: Can I blouse out the shirt a little? I like to blouse out my shirts a little.
CAL: Can I blouse out the shirt a little? I like to blouse out my shirts a little.
JACOB: Shut up, Cal.
CAL: ( HORRIFIED )
TIFFANY: Yeah, probably.
CAL: ( then, realizing ) You would!? Tiffany SHRUGS.
JACOB: You see that, Cal? The simple act of opening your mouth instantly causes Tiffany to lose interest in sleeping with you. Your personality is actually your weakest link. Cal takes this in.
CAL: Well, that's the meanest thing anyone's ever said to me.
JACOB: No, Cal. The meanest thing anyone's ever said to you is this: your wife cheated on you because you lost sight of what it took to keep her content at home as a man, as a husband, and probably as a lover. Cal's lower lip begins to quiver.
CAL: Yeah, okay, that was meaner.
CAL: I notice you only button your shirts up, like, halfway. I can't pull that off, right?
JACOB: No. Listen, Cal, I'm going to be calling women over to our table Cal rubs his hands together, nervous.
CAL: We should have some background on each other, no? I'm in insurance, more on the corporate side. My kids are
JACOB: Cal, the only thing I care less about than corporate insurance are your kids. Here's the only thing I need to know: how many women have you been with?
CAL: In my entire life?
JACOB: In my entire life?
CAL: In my entire life?
JACOB: No, synchronized swimming. Yes, Cal. Sexually. Cal thinks. He MUMBLES to himself, counting it out on one hand.
CAL: Jacob CHORTLES. But Cal just stares at him blankly.
JACOB: Wow, okay. wow. ( then, checking ) Not at a time? Total?
CAL: What? I married young. We met in high school. He smiles, remembering.
CAL: Tracy was so damn beautiful. You know those women, the ones who can be wildly sexy and unbelievably cute all at once? I never knew how she did that. I still don't know how she does it.
JACOB: Cal, I literally stopped listening at `Tracy.' Okay, here we go.
CAL: ( a bit emotional ) I miss my wife.
JACOB: Shut up, Cal. A YOUNG WOMAN slides into the booth at Jacob's side.
YOUNG WOMAN: Hi. Jacob Palmer.
JACOB: Hi. Jacob Palmer.
YOUNG WOMAN: Amy Johnson. Cal extends his hand.
CAL: ( QUICKLY )
CAL: ( QUICKLY )
JACOB: ( QUICKLY )
CAL: ( TO HIMSELF )
JACOB: Can I get you a drink, Amy?
JACOB: Tell me about yourself. What do you do?
NEW GIRL: Does it really matter?
JACOB: It does to me. She looks up. He looks completely earnest, repeats:
JACOB: It does to me. She smiles. PAN TO CAL: just sitting there watching, horrified.
NEWER GIRL: And that's when I started writing the column for LA Weekly. God, how long have I been talking? Jacob takes her hand.
JACOB: Listen, I'm going to be honest: it's getting late and I think you're interesting. I also think you're one of those rare women who manages to be both wildly sexy and incredibly cute all at once.
ON CAL: Mouth agape. That was his line!
ON JACOB: Let's get out of here. I know it's forward of me but just. I think we should get out of here. She thinks, then NODS.
JACOB: Let's get out of here. I know it's forward of me but just. I think we should get out of here. She thinks, then NODS.
NEWER GIRL: FLASH CUT TO: 37 THE SECOND GIRL 37 I think we should get out of here.
JACOB: I think we should get out of here.
NEW GIRL: FLASH CUT TO: 38 THE FIRST GIRL 38 I think we should get out of here.
JACOB: I think we should get out of here.
FIRST GIRL: 38A BACK TO CAL 38A
ROBBIE: You want to talk about The Scarlet Letter, Mrs. Thompson? Here you go: the `A' they're both wearing I think it stands for ASSHOLE. Wanna know why? Because they're in love, and love is for stupid ASSHOLES. So thanks for choosing this book, Mrs. Thompson, because this is what I need right now: to read a boring, confusing book about a bunch of stupid assholes who fell in love, like assholes, and then had to die, like assholes. I'm sorry for cursing.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ: You have a second?
TRACY: Oh, David. I'm just a little swamped right now so. He closes the door behind him.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ: You've been avoiding me.
TRACY: No, I haven't.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ: You ran away in the other direction when you saw me coming down the hall yesterday.
TRACY: I ran track in high school.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ: That must be it. He turns serious.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ: I'm sorry about you and Cal.
TRACY: Thank you.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ: I'm also not sorry, if I'm being completely honest.
TRACY: No, I do
DAVID JACOBOWITZ: A lot. Just to clarify. I like you a lot. I had no intention of falling for a married woman. I just wanted someone to go to lunch with who didn't make me want to shoot myself in the face. But we started having lunch, and talking, and suddenly I was an accountant who was popping out of bed in the morning, excited to get to work. That doesn't happen to accountants. Ever. I've checked with other accountants. She smiles.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ: So when the time is right for you to get back out there again, officially, I just. I'd like to throw my hat in the ring. Officially. That sounded weird. Tracy LAUGHS lightly, leans forward.
TRACY: David, you've been a great friend to me. And you were the first man in a very long time to make me feel. noticed, I guess? What happened between us that night. it meant something to me. You weren't the only one excited to come to work lately. David smiles.
TRACY: But now, when I see you, all I see is his face. All I see when I look at you is what I did to my She's losing it, wipes her eyes.
TRACY: You see this? I'm saving you from disaster, David, `cause you're asking to pre-board the Titanic. Honestly, do you really want any part of this? Before he can answer. BUZZ! It's Tracy's phone.
TRACY: ( INTO PHONE )
TRACY: ( calling back in ) Yes, of course. Absolutely, Principal Sapienza, it won't happen again. She closes the door behind her, looks to Robbie.
TRACY: She SIGHS.
ROBBIE: She SIGHS.
TRACY: It's been a rough couple of weeks, you deserve a freebie. C'mon, I have to get back to work. They walk out together.
TRACY: They still make kids read The Scarlet Letter, huh? Robbie NODS.
TRACY: You'd really think someone would have written something better by Robbie LAUGHS, the tension broken a bit.
TRACY: Guess I should take it down, huh?
ROBBIE: I guess.
TRACY: How is he? I've spoken to him but only about bills, or you kids, but. how is he, really? Robbie hesitates.
TRACY: Sorry, that's unfair. Ignore me, I'm almost done here. She turns back to her work. After a beat:
ROBBIE: He's dressing a lot better. Going out a lot.
TRACY: Oh. Well, good. That's. really ( then, covering ) We'll get take-out for dinner tonight, okay? Think about what you're in the mood for. Robbie hesitates, then adds:
ROBBIE: He's sad. He looks better, but. sadder, too, I think. You know?
TRACY: Yeah. I guess I'm pretty sad, I know.
ROBBIE: I know.
TRACY: You do?
ROBBIE: I heard you crying the other night and. I didn't know what to do. I'm thirteen years old and. can you just tell me what I'm supposed to do in that situation? I didn't want to Google it. She smiles, shakes her head.
TRACY: Oh God, baby, you're so much like me it's scary. You wound up with all my stuff, Robbie. I'm so I'm okay with being like you, Mom. I like you. She puts down her pen. Smiles sadly at Robbie.
ROBBIE: I'm okay with being like you, Mom. I like you. She puts down her pen. Smiles sadly at Robbie.
TRACY: It's my fault, what happened with your father. It's grown-up stuff that I can't talk about but. it's my fault. Not his. So just. be good to him, okay?
ROBBIE: It'll be okay, Mom.
TRACY: ( EMOTIONAL )
TRACY: David, this is my son, Robbie. Robbie, this is David.
TRACY: I'll be right back, okay, honey?
ROBBIE DAVID: Okay. Okay. Awkward. Really awkward. Tracy starts to say something, thinks better of it, and EXITS. David moves into the room, sits down opposite Robbie.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ: So, Robbie. I hear you're quite the soccer player.
ROBBIE: So, David. I hear you broke up my parents' marriage. He LAUGHS awkwardly, shocked.
ROBBIE: You are David Jacobowitz, right? From accounting?
DAVID JACOBOWITZ: Um, yes I am
ROBBIE: Here's the thing, David: in the end, she winds up back with my dad. He's better than you, in every category except probably math. And she still loves him. Robbie props the PHOTO of Tracy and Cal back up.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ: Listen, Robbie
ROBBIE: Now I know what you're thinking: `he's just in 8th grade, what does he know about love?' I know a lot more than you think, David. Just today, I had a meltdown, almost gave up on the love of my life. My dad's having his meltdown now, but long-term? He won't stop fighting for my mom any more than I won't stop sending Jessica texts that make her uncomfortable. And you need to know that. Tracy RE-ENTERS.
TRACY: You ready to go?
ROBBIE: ( SUDDENLY SWEET )
ON CAL: Content. His yard may not be his anymore, but it's back in order. As he takes it all in. A LIGHT pops on. Cal DIVES into a SHRUB.
JACOB: I think you're ready, Cal.
CAL: For what?
JACOB: To talk to a woman, take a woman Oh, no. No, I'm not.
CAL: Oh, no. No, I'm not.
JACOB: You've been watching me do it for two weeks.
CAL: Yeah, well, I've been watching LeBron James for years, doesn't mean I can suddenly dunk a Cal, do you remember the part in Karate Kid, where Mr. Miagi keeps having the kid wax the car and the kid gets all bent out of shape because he doesn't see the point, but the movements were actually building blocks for throwing and blocking punches?
JACOB: Cal, do you remember the part in Karate Kid, where Mr. Miagi keeps having the kid wax the car and the kid gets all bent out of shape because he doesn't see the point, but the movements were actually building blocks for throwing and blocking punches?
CAL: Oh God. Are you going to make me fight someone? Jacob stretches his neck, trying his patience:
JACOB: Cal, what's the first thing I do when a woman sits down?
CAL: You ask if you can buy her a And what if she says no?
JACOB: And what if she says no?
CAL: You order her a drink anyway, let it sit there.
JACOB: When she asks me a question about You deflect it back to her. You never answer questions about And what happens?
CAL: You deflect it back to her. You never answer questions about And what happens?
JACOB: And what happens?
CAL: They talk about themselves. A And what do I do?
JACOB: And what do I do?
CAL: You act really interested. You nod a lot.
JACOB: And at the end of the night?
CAL: You compliment them, then you ask if they'd like to come back to your place.
JACOB: Do I ask?
CAL: No. You confidently tell them you'd like them to come back to your place.
JACOB: Oh, and no talking about your job, your children, your pathetic sexual history, or David Jacobowitz. Okay, here we go.
CAL: What, no, I'm not ready for ( then, to woman ) Jacob has pulled her over. She's attractive, mid- Cal, this is Kate. Kate, Cal. Jacob NODS at Cal ( "you've got this" ) and leaves them. Kate SITS. Cal smiles at Kate, nervous. She smiles back. Cal MOTIONS for a waitress in the distance.
JACOB: Cal, this is Kate. Kate, Cal. Jacob NODS at Cal ( "you've got this" ) and leaves them. Kate SITS. Cal smiles at Kate, nervous. She smiles back. Cal MOTIONS for a waitress in the distance.
CAL: Can I buy you a drink, Kate?
CAL: I'm buying you a drink anyway, Kate, so you might as well tell me what you want.
KATE: Really, thank you but it's okay.
CAL: I'm guessing you're a vodka girl, am I right? Yeah? A nice dirty martini? No, no, no: a Grey Goose, rocks, extra lime? C'mon, one drink! Picture those ice cubes clinking together. Mmmm. Can't you taste it? She smiles.
KATE: Yes, I can but. I'm, uh, five years sober so. Cal's face drops. The WAITRESS approaches.
WAITRESS: What can I get
CAL: Nothing. We don't want anything. Don't come back here ever. The Waitress leaves, confused. Kate looks around, uncomfortable. She tries small-talk.
KATE: So. what do you do, Cal?
CAL: What do you do, Kate?
KATE: I asked you first.
CAL: I asked you second. She LAUGHS lightly, thinks he's being funny.
KATE: Seriously, what do you do?
CAL: Seriously, what do you do? Now it's getting a little weird.
KATE: I'm a teacher. Now, c'mon: what do you do? Cal NODS, exaggerated.
CAL: Teacher. Interesting. I'm very interested in teaching.
KATE: I'm sorry, are you not going to tell me what you do? He's still nodding, as if fascinated.
CAL: A teacher with an alcohol dependency no less, I bet that's actually more common than people I should get back to my friends Kate STANDS. Cal puts his face in his hands.
KATE: I should get back to my friends Kate STANDS. Cal puts his face in his hands.
CAL: I'm sorry! I'm supposed to deflect your questions. oh screw it: I'm in corporate insurance. And I have children. Plural. More than one. The only thing I have ONE of, is sexual partners, that would be the woman I recently separated from because she was cheating on me with David Jacobowitz who I wasn't supposed to tell you about either.
KATE: What were you supposed to tell me?
CAL: I don't know: that you're a perfect combination of sexy and cute it was something I said about my wife that's since been corrupted. But I'm tired, and I'm at least fifteen years older than you, and this sweater is called slim fitting but it's really just uncomfortable and itchy.
KATE: You think I'm a perfect combination of sexy and cute? Cal looks up.
CAL: That's what you took away from She smiles, sits back down.
KATE: Wow, an actual honest man. I don't know what to do with that. It's kind of. rare around here.
CAL: It is?
KATE: You have no idea. I'm kind of a magnet for these jerk-offs. They charm me, and I fall for it, and at some point they just. never call me again.
CAL: ( GENUINE )
KATE: So. what were you `supposed' to do next?
CAL: Well, eventually I'm `supposed' to ask you if you want to get out of here. Actually no, I'm supposed to tell you, confidently, that you should come home with me.
KATE: Why don't you give it a shot, see what happens? Cal looks up, surprised. He clears his throat, then:
CAL: You're very pretty, Kate. And I can't tell if you're being serious, but I think you should come home with me.
KATE: ( PLAYFUL )
CAL: I'm not asking you, Kate. I'm telling you: you should come home with me. Kate looks up, genuinely turned-on. CUE MUSIC: "SEXYBACK" by Justin Timberlake.
CAL: ( gasping for breath ) This is my dumpy apartment that I had to move into when I left my I love that you're being so honest. It's so different, so I've never been with a woman besides my ex-wife.
KATE: ( TURNED ON )
CAL: I've never been with a woman besides my ex-wife.
KATE: More, tell me more.
CAL: I'm worried you have AIDS. She stops.
CAL: Only a little. She pushes him down on the couch, takes her sweater off. She's wearing just a bra. She looks amazing.
KATE: What do you want to do with me?
CAL: Show you off to my wife to make her jealous. She GROWLS and dives on top of him as we launch:
MEANWHILE: 1 ) HANNAH studies late into the night for the bar. 2 ) JESSICA reads magazine articles on "How to Make Him Notice You." 3 ) TRACY eats ice cream in bed, alone. 4 ) ROBBIE drags mysterious wood planks into his backyard. But we're mainly with CAL.
JACOB: . it would work!
CAL: You're out of your mind.
JACOB: What do college guys hate? Doing laundry. What do they love? Strippers. It's a strip club where they can do their laundry.
CAL: It's ridiculous.
JACOB: And yours isn't? A candy store that only sells red candy.
CAL: Everyone loves the cherry. Look, I'm not rejecting the psuedo- cherry flavors like raspberry or strawberry, anything in the -erry family is allowed. But let's be real here: no one wants the lemon. No one likes the grape.
JACOB: I like grape.
CAL: Well then you can't come to my They LAUGH, quickly becoming inseparable.
CLAIRE: Oh, I almost forgot heard some good gossip at the nail salon.
BERNIE: For God's sake, Claire.
CLAIRE: ( SING-SONGY )
BERNIE: Leave the poor bastard alone, would you? I gave him the cologne like you told me to. We don't have to dance on his grave.
CLAIRE: Apparently, Mr. Weaver has become quite a man-about-town if you get my drift.
JESSICA: Lots of young women coming in and out of his apartment lately.
CLAIRE: Lots of young women coming in and out of his apartment lately.
BERNIE: Claire, would you cut it out?
CLAIRE: It's good for Jess to know. She still baby-sits for him after all.
BERNIE: Oh, c'mon! Enough.
CLAIRE: Well, it's good gossip at the least. Ooh, guess what else I As she CONTINUES CHATTERING in the b.g., we HOLD ON Jessica. Thinking.
JESSICA: Madison! Madison, wait! Madison stops walking, but not texting.
JESSICA: Hey, I had a question Madison holds up a finger ( "one second" ) and continues texting. Finally, she stops. Looks up. Smiles.
MADISON: Hey, Jessica, whassup?
JESSICA: I had a question for you, Madison. It's kind of on the personal side My lips are. Madison extends her arms, begins clapping and making WEIRD NOISES. Jessica stares at her blankly.
MADISON: My lips are. Madison extends her arms, begins clapping and making WEIRD NOISES. Jessica stares at her blankly.
MADISON: ( EXPLAINING ) ( THEN )
JESSICA: Oh, okay. So, Madison, here's the thing. I don't mean to be blunt or insulting but, let's call it what it is: you're always sleeping with older guys, right?
MADISON: ( NODDING )
JESSICA: Lots of college guys, I've heard.
MADISON: Lots of them.
JESSICA: Even rumors about a few teachers.
MADISON: So my question is: how do you do that? I mean, how do you get them not to see you as. well, a kid in high school?
JESSICA: So my question is: how do you do that? I mean, how do you get them not to see you as. well, a kid in high school?
MADISON: Oh, well first off, I have a huge You do, yes.
JESSICA: You do, yes.
MADISON: So that helps.
JESSICA: Yes, I'm sure it does.
MADISON: You don't have a huge rack.
JESSICA: No, I don't unfortunately.
MADISON: So that's not gonna work.
JESSICA: Madison SIGHS.
MADISON: Okay, here's what you do. Wait, how old is he?
JESSICA: ( CONTINUED ) 54 CONTINUED: ( 2 ) 54
MADISON: Like really old?
JESSICA: Like parent old.
MADISON: Nasty. Rock on, Jessica.
JESSICA: Thank you, Madison.
MADISON: Alright, you have to hook him. Force his hand. Make him unable to stop himself from doing what he knows to be wrong.
JESSICA: Do what I do. Send him a postcard from downtown.
MADISON: Do what I do. Send him a postcard from downtown.
JESSICA: Go TMZ on his ass.
MADISON: Go TMZ on his ass.
JESSICA: I'm not following you, Madis
MADISON: The full gyno. Off Jessica's blank look.
MADISON: A crotch shot? A nip slip?
JESSICA: Jesus, Madison!
MADISON: Well, you came to me for advice, that's my advice. You put those across his radar, he won't see you as a little girl anymore, that's for sure. Madison walks off, calls back.
MADISON: Don't send it to him as a jpeg, though. He'll put it up on his fantasy football web-site. And then your brother sees it, tells your mom, and suddenly you're not allowed to use Facebook for a month. Thanks, Kevin! She leaves Jessica there, processing the advice.
ROBBIE: ( DRAMATICALLY )
ON JESSICA: Oh shit.
ROBBIE: Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote in The Scarlet Letter: `No man for any considerable period can wear one face to himself and another to the multitude, without finally getting bewildered as to which may be the Robbie puts down the paper, ignoring the jeers.
ROBBIE: I am not bewildered! Jessica Riley is my soulmate. She's the one! I know it to be true, and so now do the multitude.
JESSICA: Robbie, get down!
ROBBIE: I have marked myself with this Scarlet J, Jessica! For you. Because your name starts with a J. It's just tape and construction paper but one day I will get a permanent tattoo when I'm old enough that my parents won't freak out on me.
JESSICA: Robbie Weaver! I am your baby- sitter and I'm telling you to GET
JESSICA: ( HEATED WHISPER )
ROBBIE: You like the scaffold? It has wheels. Took four weeks to build Oh, those are my friends, they helped me wheel it down. Wave OFF TO THE SIDE: Three excited THIRTEEN-YEAR-OLDS WAVE and give THUMBS-UPS to Robbie. Jessica waves, confused, turns back to Robbie.
JESSICA: This has to stop, Robbie. You'll learn to love me. I I won't.
ROBBIE: You'll learn to love me. I I won't.
JESSICA: I won't.
ROBBIE: Just because I'm four years younger than you?
JESSICA: BECAUSE I LOVE SOMEONE ELSE!!! This stops Robbie dead in his tracks.
JESSICA: I've been spending time with him for a while. Robbie stumbles, less sure-footed than usual.
ROBBIE: No. You can't. I've checked. No boyfriend since ninth grade. No date for Spring Formal last
MONTH: He's older. I don't want my parents to know. And with that, Robbie literally just sits down on the ground, all the wind taken out of him. It might be the cutest thing you've ever seen.
JESSICA: He's older. I don't want my parents to know. And with that, Robbie literally just sits down on the ground, all the wind taken out of him. It might be the cutest thing you've ever seen.
ROBBIE: Who is he?
JESSICA: It doesn't matter.
ROBBIE: Do I know him? Is he from town?
JESSICA: I don't know. Yes, kind of.
ROBBIE: I'll kill him if he hurts you. Jessica tries not to smile.
JESSICA: I know. But this all has to stop now, Robbie. The speeches, the texts, all of it. It's very sweet, but it has to stop. He just sits there, lost.
JESSICA: I'll see you around, okay? She EXITS. Robbie remains seated on the grass. Devastated. His three friends approach.
ROBBIE'S FRIEND: We should probably get the scaffold back on the road before 56 INT. CAL'S CORPORATE APARTMENT - AFTERNOON ( NEXT DAY ) 56 Robbie's on the couch, dejected. His little sister sits next to him, watching High School Musical as always. In the adjoining kitchen, Cal is on the phone.
ROBBIE: 56 INT. CAL'S CORPORATE APARTMENT - AFTERNOON ( NEXT DAY ) 56
CAL: ( INTO PHONE )
CAL: Oh, I've been keeping busy. Made a new buddy, I've been spending time with him. Yeah, I'm going to see her tomorrow night. Of course I miss her. You don't know how much I miss.
ROBBIE: So you're seeing Mom tomorrow, huh? At my parent-teacher thing?
CAL: First time in a while.
ROBBIE: First time in a while.
CAL: Yeah, but no biggie. Cal tosses him back the ball.
CAL: Hey, what's with the moping?
ROBBIE: Nothing. It's just. there's this girl. Cal smiles.
CAL: Oh yeah? You like her?
ROBBIE: I like Pringles. This girl's my soulmate. I'm like crazy, stupid, in love with her. And she wants someone else.
CAL: But she's your soulmate?
ROBBIE: Well you can't just give up.
CAL: Well you can't just give up.
ROBBIE: Why not? ( then, quietly ) You did. Cal freezes.
ROBBIE: Mom was yours, right?
CAL: I didn't give up.
ROBBIE: Listen, Dad. I love you. I have your back, always. But let's be honest here: the woman told you she wanted a divorce and you jumped out of a car.
CAL: It was slightly more complicated than that. And I'm a different guy now.
ROBBIE: You're the same guy. You just have different clothes. Do you still love her?
CAL: How old ARE you?
ROBBIE: ( STRONGLY )
CAL: Weren't we talking about you?
ROBBIE: We are. Your son is in desperate need of some romantic inspiration. So set an example for your boy. Don't give up. It's complicated? Uncomplicate it. She says no? Change her mind. Look at you, you're the man right now, Dad. Get her back.
TRACY: ( FLOORED )
CAL: Oh, well turns out I've been buying the wrong size suit for twenty years so.
TRACY: Well you look great. Really. Cal smiles.
CAL: Thank you.
CAL: I talked to Nanna yesterday.
TRACY: Me, too. She sound okay to you?
CAL: She sounded like. Nanna. She worries about us.
CAL: I feel like I'm about to get Tracy LAUGHS, tension broken a bit.
CAL: Which teacher is this?
TRACY: Mrs. Thompson. This is the one he pulled The Scarlet Letter Asshole routine on. Cal smiles.
CAL: He's a really weird kid, isn't he?
TRACY: ( THEN )
CAL: I do, too. I'm so glad we switched the babies at the Me, too. They LAUGH. God, these two are great together when they're in rhythm. The laughter trickles away. An awkward beat, then:
TRACY: Me, too. They LAUGH. God, these two are great together when they're in rhythm. The laughter trickles away. An awkward beat, then:
CAL: So, how are things with. ( a beat, then ) How's it going with David? She looks down.
TRACY: Oh. it's not.
CAL: No, I know.
TRACY: You seeing anyone?
CAL: Who, me? No. You know me. No, not really.
TRACY: Oh. Because you hear things, you Yeah, well. Another long beat of silence. Cal gathers himself, takes a breath, and turns toward Tracy.
CAL: Yeah, well. Another long beat of silence. Cal gathers himself, takes a breath, and turns toward Tracy.
CAL: I miss you, T. Tracy looks up surprised.
CAL: I got complacent, I think. You find your soulmate in high school. you've got the game sewed up in the first quarter, you She smiles.
CAL: I put in an effort when we were younger, didn't I? I'd do anything to make you happy: take you miniature golfing, dancing you were such a good dancer.
TRACY: I had to be. You were such a good miniature golfer. He smiles, emboldened.
CAL: All I ever wanted to do was make you love me. And then you did, really early on. And we got married so young. And I guess. I got lazy. I got boring. And I'm furious at you for what you did. But I don't totally blame you, if that makes any sense?
TRACY: He's a very strange boy, isn't he?
CAL: I'll be honest: he scares the shit out of me. She LAUGHS through her tears.
TRACY: I missed you, too. Cal takes her hand, kisses it.
AT DOORWAY: It's Robbie's English teacher, Mrs. Thompson. better known to us as: KATE ( the teacher from the bar who Cal slept with ). Cal freezes, his lips on Tracy's hand.
CAL: Oh God.
KATE: Cal? What are you doing here?
CAL: ( looking to the sky ) You two know each other?
TRACY: You two know each other?
CAL: Um, yes. we've met before.
KATE: We've met before? Seriously?
CAL: Mrs. Thompson? This is my wife. Oh, so now she's your WIFE again?
KATE: Oh, so now she's your WIFE again?
HOW CONVENIENT!: Kate's getting louder now.
CAL: Why don't we head inside?
KATE: YES, WHY DON'T WE!? She STORMS INSIDE. Tracy looks at Cal, follows her in.
TRACY: I'm sorry, I'm playing catch-up: how do you two know each other?
KATE: Maybe your husband should tell Cal hesitates.
CAL: We have a mutual friend.
KATE: You know, maybe we should focus on Yes, let's do that. Let's focus on Robbie. Kate goes to her blackboard.
CAL: You know, maybe we should focus on Yes, let's do that. Let's focus on Robbie. Kate goes to her blackboard.
KATE: Yes, let's do that. Let's focus on Robbie. Kate goes to her blackboard.
KATE: As you know, Robbie's shining moment this year was when he set a school record for cursing in an eighth grade English class. She writes on the board: ASSHOLE. She underlines it.
KATE: Asshole. Are you familiar with this word, Mrs. Weaver?
CAL: She's heard it, yes. So in terms of Robbie's progress
KATE: Asshole: as in, someone who tells a woman that he'll call, and never We were a little concerned about Robbie's grade on his oral book
CAL: We were a little concerned about Robbie's grade on his oral book
REPORT: Asshole: as in, someone who uses `honesty' to get a woman into bed with him, but is actually full of shit like the rest of them.
KATE: Asshole: as in, someone who uses `honesty' to get a woman into bed with him, but is actually full of shit like the rest of them.
CAL: Because usually he's a very strong public speaker
KATE: Asshole: as in, someone who allows a woman to go down on him for forty-five minutes because he's `nervous'
CAL: OKAY! ENOUGH!!! Kate stops. Cal turns to Tracy. She looks crestfallen.
OKAY! ENOUGH!!!: Kate stops. Cal turns to Tracy. She looks crestfallen.
CAL: I can explain. Tracy rushes out of the room. Cal calls after her.
CAL: She's an alcoholic! You can't trust what she says!
CAL: Tracy, wait!
TRACY: Leave me alone, Cal!
KATE: I'm sober for FIVE YEARS, you
ASSHOLE!: ON SPECTATORS
ON SPECTATORS: TEACHERS and PARENTS ( including Jessica's parents ), stepping out into the hallway and following them outside.
CAL: Tracy, c'mon! We were separated.
TRACY: ( fumbling for keys ) I know, and I cheated, so it doesn't make any sense for me to be mad at you.
CAL: Okay, so
TRACY: I can't do this now, Cal.
CAL: Tracy, I love you.
KATE: Tell her she's the perfect combination of sexy and cute,
ASSHOLE!: Tracy looks at Cal, stunned. That's their thing.
CAL: It's a funny story, actually
TRACY: I'm going home. She opens the car door.
CAL: Tracy, wait! Yes, I slept with her! I slept with our son's eighth grade teacher! GASPS from the crowd. Claire ( Jessica's Mom ) takes a picture with her cell phone.
CAL: But all it did was confirm what I already knew: THAT I LOVE, YOU!
CAL: Before, you were the only woman I'd ever been with or wanted to be with. And now, even after I've been with eleven women, you're
CAL: ( MEEKLY COMPLETING )
TRACY: I don't even know who you are. Tracy gets in her car and speeds off.
CAL: ( weakly, to himself ) I'm your soulmate. Cal turns around to the crowd, only to be met. By a SLAP ACROSS the face by Kate. She STORMS OFF.
CAL: HE DESERVED AN `A' ON THAT BOOK REPORT AND YOU KNOW IT! THUNDER CRACKS in the sky. It begins to pour. Cal stands there, soaked. He looks up at the sky.
CAL: 63 EXT. CHEESECAKE FACTORY 63 64 INT. CHEESECAKE FACTORY - CONTINUOUS ACTION 64
REALLY!!!???: 63 EXT. CHEESECAKE FACTORY 63 64 INT. CHEESECAKE FACTORY - CONTINUOUS ACTION 64
RICHARD: Excuse me, everyone. Everyone!? The room goes quiet.
RICHARD: Now, if we could get our guest of honor over here. I forget what she looks like, anyone remember? POLITE LAUGHS. Liz GAGS herself with her finger, looks at Hannah. Hannah takes a deep breath, downs her drink, and walks over to Richard. Is this it?
RICHARD: I'm so proud of you, baby. I had my doubts, of course. More CHEESY LAUGHTER.
RICHARD: Now I did tell you that it'd be a special night when you passed the bar. And I'm a lawyer so you know I never lie. More HECKLING from the crowd. Liz desperately orders another drink, barely able to take it.
RICHARD: So, Hannah, I'd like to formally ask you, in front of all our friends and colleagues.
RICHARD: . if you'd like to become a permanent lawyer at the firm of Watkins, Goldberg, and Schmidt!? CHEERS. Hannah steps back, breathless. Richard reacts.
RICHARD: You don't have a better offer already, do you? Everyone LAUGHS.
HANNAH: No, that's great. I just. ( then, privately ) I'm sorry, I thought. I thought you were about to propose. The room goes quiet, trying to hear.
RICHARD: No, I just. it's fine. I'm sorry, I just got thrown is all. Richard pulls Hannah off to the side.
HANNAH: No, I just. it's fine. I'm sorry, I just got thrown is all. Richard pulls Hannah off to the side.
RICHARD: Honey, I'm so sorry, I didn't No, no, don't be silly, it's fine.
HANNAH: No, no, don't be silly, it's fine.
RICHARD: It's definitely a possibility, down the road. I think I just need a little more time. I'm still figuring out how I feel about us, you know: long-term.
HANNAH: No, I know.
RICHARD: She's really laughing now.
HANNAH: You know what the best part is: I would have said yes! To YOU! And I didn't even want you to propose! Just now, I swear to God: I was hoping you wouldn't propose. And I still would have said YES! That's how pathetic I am! She snags someone else's drink from the table, DOWNS IT. She grabs Richard's cheeks.
HANNAH: I will consider your job offer, thank you so much, Richard. Hysterically LAUGHING, she walks away. As she passes, Liz sticks out her hand and they slap five.
WOMAN: And you know what she said?
ON JACOB: Standing there, in all his glory. He flashes his coolest smile. They melt. We've seen this before. SLAM! The door to the bar busts open, revealing:
HANNAH: Do you remember me?
JACOB: Do you still think I'm attractive?
HANNAH: Do you still think I'm attractive?
JACOB: Do you still want to take me home?
HANNAH: Do you still want to take me home?
JACOB: Hannah NODS, takes his hand.
HANNAH: Let's go. She leads him out of the bar. We STAY WITH the WOMEN Jacob had just been introducing himself to.
WOMAN #1: 66 INT. JACOB'S APARTMENT - LATER 66
HANNAH: This place looks like something out of a men's magazine.
JACOB: Is that a compliment?
HANNAH: I'm not sure. Music starts playing: "As Tears Go By" by the Stones.
HANNAH: I like this song.
JACOB: I thought you would.
HANNAH: Yes, please. Jacob pours two nice glasses of SCOTCH, neat. Brings them ( and the bottle ) over towards the couch. He pats the couch. Hannah nods, walks over, sits down.
JACOB: They CLINK. Jacob takes a sip. Hannah downs hers. She holds out her glass for a refill. Jacob raises a brow, pours her another. This time she HOLDS HER NOSE as she downs it. As soon as she finishes So is this how it normally works?
HANNAH: They CLINK. Jacob takes a sip. Hannah downs hers. She holds out her glass for a refill. Jacob raises a brow, pours her another. This time she HOLDS HER NOSE as she downs it. As soon as she finishes So is this how it normally works?
HANNAH: So is this how it normally works?
JACOB: How you woo a woman? You take them back to your granite- countered bachelor pad, put on the perfect song, and make them a Yes. That's how it normally Hannah NODS, grabs the bottle, takes a swig.
HANNAH: How you woo a woman? You take them back to your granite- countered bachelor pad, put on the perfect song, and make them a Yes. That's how it normally Hannah NODS, grabs the bottle, takes a swig.
JACOB: Yes. That's how it normally Hannah NODS, grabs the bottle, takes a swig.
HANNAH: And then you sleep with them?
JACOB: So that's what happens next? We sleep together?
HANNAH: So that's what happens next? We sleep together?
JACOB: At some point, yes, I was under the impression that was your plan. She takes a deep breath, admits:
HANNAH: I'm very nervous.
JACOB: I'm getting that.
HANNAH: I know at the bar I seemed confident, but I was more just soaking wet and cold and trying to be dramatic. Jacob LAUGHS. He actually LAUGHS.
JACOB: You're adorable. Hannah SNAPS, already tipsy.
HANNAH: No! Not adorable! Sexy! R-rated sexy! Because I know what happens next in the PG-13 version of tonight: I get really drunk, and I pass out, and you cover me with a blanket, and kiss my forehead, and nothing happens. but that's not why I'm here!
JACOB: I don't think people say `bang' I do. We're going to bang. I'm finally going to do something exciting and dangerous and Liz can blow me! Hannah shakes her hands out, pumping herself up.
HANNAH: I do. We're going to bang. I'm finally going to do something exciting and dangerous and Liz can blow me! Hannah shakes her hands out, pumping herself up.
HANNAH: Okay, okay, this is happening.
JACOB: I need to stop thinking. Take off your shirt. Jacob SHRUGS, stands, unbuttons his shirt and takes it off. He's ripped.
HANNAH: I need to stop thinking. Take off your shirt. Jacob SHRUGS, stands, unbuttons his shirt and takes it off. He's ripped.
HANNAH: Holy crap. She pokes a finger at his abs.
HANNAH: It's like you're photo-shopped.
JACOB: Now take off yours.
HANNAH: No way! Not with all that She motions casually at his abs.
HANNAH: So. do you prefer to do it here or in the bedroom?
JACOB: ( AMUSED )
HANNAH: Good. Let's go there.
HANNAH: ( TIPSY )
JACOB: I'm glad you like it. They resume kissing. After a beat, she pulls back again.
HANNAH: Wait, are these those foam pillows from Brookstone? Off his look.
HANNAH: They are, aren't they!? I always wondered who actually buys them! You do! The hot guy from the bar buys them! Of course! She shakes her head, amazed. Gathers herself.
HANNAH: Sorry, let's proceed. Jacob smiles, goes to kiss her. she pulls back again.
HANNAH: You don't have one of those ridiculous massage chairs, do you?
JACOB: ( LYING )
HANNAH: Oh. My. God! You totally do!
JACOB: ( ADMITTING )
HANNAH: How much did it cost?
JACOB: Five thousand doll That DOUBLES HER OVER, hysterical. Jacob starts laughing with her. really laughing. We can tell: this is different for him. He likes her. We watch him as he realizes that. As he processes it. We watch him look at Hannah.
ON HANNAH: Hair in her face: drunk, laughing, completely amazing. And then. Jacob does the most unexpected thing:
JACOB: Do me a favor. Ask me a question about myself.
HANNAH: What? No! I don't want to know anything about you.
JACOB: C'mon, one question.
HANNAH: Okay, fine, but then we bang.
JACOB: Absolutely. Now, come on, I'll answer anything. You can ask me about my job, or past
GIRLFRIENDS: What's your mom like?
HANNAH: What's your mom like?
JACOB: Icy. I guess? Not cruel, but cold. Very cold.
HANNAH: And your father?
JACOB: He died, long time ago. Left us a lot of money, which is how I He motions at his PILLOW.
JACOB: Stuff like this. She motions at his abs.
HANNAH: And time for stuff like that? He LAUGHS.
JACOB: My dad was the opposite of my mom, We PULL BACK as they continue chatting. TIME PASSES, as one question leads to another, and then Body language shifts. Soon they're sitting in bed, sharing the Scotch from the bottle, just talking. Then kissing. Then lying on their sides, face-to-face, talking some more. Until finally: it's Jacob who passes out. And it's Hannah who covers him with a blanket, and kisses him on the forehead, and begins falling in love with him. CUE MUSIC as we begin a.
JACOB: staring down at his hand, locked with Hannah's. He looks 71 INT. HANNAH'S BEDROOM - EVENING 71 Now it's Hannah who's asleep in bed, and Jacob who stares at her lovingly. Suddenly, he catches himself. In a series of COMEDIC JUMP-CUTS, he wrestles with the implications of what's happening to him. Pacing. A drink. A big drink. Fingers pulling at his own hair. Hyperventilating. More staring. More 71A INT. HANNAH'S BEDROOM 71A And finally, he loses the battle: he tucks Hannah under a blanket, kisses her forehead, and finally. Gives in to falling in love with her.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ: I had fun tonight, Tracy. And I was wondering if
TRACY: David, stop. Look, I had a nice time, which is a substantial upgrade from the rest of the. times I've been having lately. So, I don't think I'm ready to start dating but my ex clearly is and there's a yogurt shop where they make this eight calorie ice cream that tastes like a laxative, so if you'd like to take me there sometime I guess I wouldn't say Wow. You know, that's exactly what I was thinking. It's almost They LAUGH. This is the moment. Romantic chemistry. Are they going to kiss? Holy cow. And then. THE DOOR OPENS. Jessica stands there.

TRACY: Oh, thanks. Tracy reaches for her purse, awkwardly.
TRACY: So how much do I owe yo
JESSICA: Did you know your kids are the only ones I baby-sit for who always want to stay awake so they can see their dad when he gets home. I mean, they fight with everything they have to keep their eyes open so they can hear what Dad had for dinner, or how he liked the movie. Lot of kids want to stay awake for Mom and your kids always want to see you, don't get me wrong but not a lot wait up for Dad. Maybe it's because he's good, and he's kind, and he's What are you talking abo

JESSICA: She jumps, but it's too late.
ON BERNIE: Staring at the picture. We don't see it, but we get the point: it's a father's worst nightmare. Bernie, dazed, slides the pictures back into the envelope. He looks at the envelope again.
ON ENVELOPE: Cal's name. A heart.
JESSICA: Bernie puts a hand up. He can't speak. He marches out the door. From inside we hear a car SCREECH AWAY.
ON JESSICA: Realizing. She grabs a second set of keys.

ROBBIE: I have to blindfold you.

ON STAGE: We WATCH the ceremony for a moment. The PRINCIPAL labors through her introduction.
KATE: Our next speaker is not only the class salutatorian, but he's also one of the most.
ROBBIE: ( a bit monotone ) Thank you, Mrs. Thompson. Welcome, Class of 2011.
ROBBIE: I grew up a lot this year, I think. I used to think that growing up meant really growing. Like getting taller and bigger. But now I think that growing up just makes you smaller. Your dreams get smaller, and what you want gets smaller. ( beat, then ) I grew an inch and a half this year, but I feel a lot smaller. Cal sits forward, getting increasingly concerned.
ROBBIE: I was in love. And I know that makes parents laugh because I'm only thirteen but whatever, I was.
ROBBIE: ( awkward, to crowd ) Hi, everyone. Silence. No one knows what to do. Cal is suddenly really uncomfortable.
CAL: ( awkward, to crowd ) Hi, everyone. Silence. No one knows what to do. Cal is suddenly really uncomfortable.
CAL: May I have a word with my son? It'll just take a second. Cal tries to extricate himself from his row. He steps over people, squeezes by people, almost trips. Finally clear, he gathers himself, and tries to keep his dignity as he marches down the aisle past his family. Robbie comes to the front of the stage, bends down.
ROBBIE: ( HEATED WHISPER )
CAL: I don't know. What are you doing? Robbie's eyes well up with tears.
ROBBIE: I was wrong, Dad. There's no such thing as Cal turns toward the crowd, announces:
CAL: My son's graduation speech sucks. GASPS from the crowd.
ON CAL: Now standing, alone, front and center in front of an entire eighth grade graduation ceremony. He looks behind him at the panel of TEACHERS. MRS. THOMPSON discreetly gives Cal the finger.
CAL: In fairness, I don't know where he was going but I think we can all agree it was heading in a pretty depressing direction. And I basically wrote it for him. I mean, I didn't literally write it but I sure as hell influenced it, and the kid's already a spitting image of his mother and I'll be damned if this is what he's going to get from me. People squirm, uncomfortable. This is a train wreck.
CAL: My son not him, my actual son he believes in grand romantic gestures. He believes that people have soulmates. And we always want to tell our thirteen-year- olds that they're wrong, that `one day you'll understand, young man.' But maybe it should be the other way around. He looks at Tracy, out in the crowd.
CAL: I met my soulmate when I was fifteen years old. Our first date, we went for ice cream. After, my dad started teasing me about my `first date' the way dads do. And I told him: `stop making a big deal, Dad. I'm going to go on lots of dates with plenty of girls.' That was the first time I ever lied to my father.
ROBBIE: I still love you, Jessica! I've loved you since the first time you changed my sister's diaper! I've loved you since. The crowd reacts ( LAUGHS, CHEERS, etc. ) as Robbie continues. Cal stands back and smiles. His boy is back.
CAL: Hi, Nanna.
HANNAH: He smiles at her, adoring.
CAL: My perfect girl. He kisses her forehead, turns to Jacob.
CAL: I already ordered a gun. I'm not kidding. I ordered a Colt .45 on a shady internet site, I can show you the receipt. If you hurt her, I am prepared to shoot you in the Cal, I'm not going to
JACOB: Cal, I'm not going to
CAL: Shut up, Jacob. Jacob shuts up.
CAL: Wow. I like that. Jacob smiles, shakes hands with Cal. Cal notices:
CAL: Is that a new shirt?
JACOB: Hannah took me to the Gap. It's actually not as bad as I thought.
CAL: Of course not, Cal. It's the Gap. I got this at Nordstrom's. And like that. order is restored in the universe.
JACOB: Of course not, Cal. It's the Gap. I got this at Nordstrom's. And like that. order is restored in the universe.
ROBBIE: It was nice of you to come.
JESSICA: I wouldn't have missed it. So, how are things with your dad?
ROBBIE: So, how are things with your dad?
JESSICA: Strained. I took a summer internship up at Stanford, gonna head up there early. Figure it can't hurt to get out of his line of sight for a while.
ROBBIE: Yeah, probably a good idea.
JESSICA: Wait: I thought you weren't giving up.
ROBBIE: I'm not. But I figure: you like my dad, and one day I'll look like my dad, so I'll just come for you Jessica smiles.
JESSICA: It's a good plan. She looks over her shoulder, reaches into her purse.
JESSICA: Until then: a little graduation gift. To help get you through high school. She hands him something in an ENVELOPE: the same type of envelope she once used for. Robbie peeks inside. His eyes BUG OUT. Jessica kisses him, sweetly, on the cheek.
JESSICA: You take care, Robbie. Robbie watches her go. Love-struck once more. Cal steps up next to his son.
CAL: You okay, buddy?
ROBBIE: ( RE: ENVELOPE )
CAL: We might have to lock him up. Tracy smiles. Cal walks over toward her.
TRACY: You gave a good eighth grade graduation speech.
CAL: I've been working on it for thirty years, so. She LAUGHS, then. quiet.
TRACY: Do you think we can ever come back from all this, Cal?
CAL: I don't know. I'd like to try though. I know I'd like to try. She nods, thinking.
TRACY: Things are just so messed up. And it's been such a strange year. I've been in such a strange place. And we have all these problems, so many problems I've lost count, but at the end of the day, I mean, the only thing I know She stops herself, emotional. Then, simply:
TRACY: I am just so glad you took me for that ice cream. Cal smiles. They share the moment in silence. And then:
TRACY: It was rocky road by the way.
CAL: As they JOKE and ARGUE about what flavor the ice cream was, we PULL BACK. Off to the side, Robbie steps away from his friends and watches them enjoy one another's company. He smiles.
