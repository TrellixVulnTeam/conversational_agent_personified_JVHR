ALEXI: Snow, maybe?
DIMITRI: What, you gonna ski on this? He indicates the mound of fresh dirt. Spits into the grave.
ELLY: Guess the picnic got rained out. She looks down o.s. at
ELLY: Oh, scary. The bird blinks at her from the headstone.
ELLY: What are you, like, the night Another blink from El Birdo.
ALBRECHT: You gotta put the mustard underneath first.
MICKEY: Maybe a flood, like in the Bible.
ALBRECHT: Here, let me do it. He grabs the dog from Mickey. Mickey puffs his cigar while he cooks. Albrecht methodically spreads a napkin and performs surgery on the hot dog, coating the bun with mustard, rolling the dog in the bun. Flashes Mickey a "gimme" look.
ALBRECHT: Come on. onion. Don't cheap out on me. Lotta onions.
MICKEY: Heyyy it's the Elly monster.
ALBRECHT: How do you ride that thing on a wet street?
ELLY: Talent. Hi.
ALBRECHT: Care for a hot dog?
ELLY: You buying?
ALBRECHT: I'm buying. Elly grabs the stool next to Albrecht. They`ve done this routine before.
ELLY: No onions though, okay?
ALBRECHT: ( horror ) No onions?
ELLY: They make you fart. Mickey laughs. Spots Elly a Coke.
MICKEY: What's goin' on, Elly?
ELLY: I went to see a friend of mine.
MICKEY: Well, how's your friend?
ELLY: She's still dead. Albrecht and Mickey exchange a look re: Elly's matter-of- EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT ( RAIN ) Thunder KABOOMS o.s. The crow pecks the top of the stone again and a chip of granite flies off, bang!
ERIC: What the hell are you?
SKULL COWBOY: Interested? Follow the crow. NB. The Skull Cowboy speaks in nicely distorted, buzzlike charnal house whisper. Unsettling and hackle-raising. Eric turns back to the bird, which takes wing in the rain, His eyes follow it. He looks back, disoriented, doubtful, but the Skull Cowboy is gone.
SKANK: What about working girl? INTERCUT the woman's increasingly horrified reactions.
SKANK: I say we leave her here to fry, T-Bird looks casually at the woman. Smiles hideously.
TB: ( pissed off ) Skank, shut her the fuck up! SKank punches her and she sags. Then he looks forward.
SKANK: Whoaaa T-Bird, red light, red EXT. STREET CORNER NEAR MAXI-DOGS - NIGHT As the T-Bird slews wide, cutting sidewalk, scattering nightwalkers, immediately attracting everybody's attention.
ALBRECHT: Mickey grabs the counter phone instantly.
MICKEY: Call it in? Albrecht is off and running for the corner already.
ALBRECHT: Yeah, do it! Stay right there! HOLD ON MICKEY. He points at Albrecht's hot dog. Yecch.
MICKEY: ( yelling after ) You want I should save this for EXT. MOUTH OF ALLEY ACROSS FROM CEMETERY - NIGHT The car slides to a nose-down panic stop.
ALBRECHT: Here now! You're gonna be okay! Can you understand me? I'm a police officer. The woman is no longer in pain. Deathly calm now.
WOMAN: He touched me and it stopped. The What did you say?
ALBRECHT: What did you say?
WOMAN: I saw a ghost. Her eyes roll back and she dies in Albrecht's arms.
ALBRECHT: Oh no. don't go, darlin', you stay with me, now. shit!
SIRENS: Fire. In the rain.
ERIC: Fire. In the rain.
NGO NWA: He will see me. unannounced.
LAO: ( formal greeting )
NWA: ( dismissiveness, contempt, then chastizing anger as: ) Nwa INDICATES the blade with some ridicule.
LAO: ( phony assuagement )
NWA: ( knows it's bullshit ) Lao turns, staring out the blinds, fighting for control. Deep breath. He turns back to his "master." Nwa gestures broadly at the oppulent office, indicating that Lao should be grateful, but is somehow errant
NWA: ( respect is required )
LAO: ( begrudging agreement ) Lao sees the blade. An idea. He lifts it reverently, bears it the Nwa hilt-first in both hands, as if bestowing a thing of immeasurable worth.
NGO NWA: ( why give me this? ) Nonetheless, Nwa accepts the blade. It gleams. Hypnotic. Even Nwa has to admire it. Turns it so the blade is pointed at his sternum. His attitude indicates Lao is too far away to do anything untoward.
LAO: ( sinister punchline ) Lao spins through the air and HEEL-KICKS the blade THROUGH Nwa's chest, pinning him to the door. It's over so fast the gasp of astonishment never escapes Nwa. Lao is much more than merely treacherous, he is extremely capable.
LAO: ( in perfect English ) When I spoke of an offering, I didn't mean an offering to you.
GRANGE: You gonna smoke his bones now, or however it is you do it? Lao smiles indulgently. He wipes the blood from the blade on the jacket of his ex-lord. Lao now bows to no one.
ERIC: "My kitten walks on velvet feet, and makes no sound at all. And in the doorway nightly sits to watch the darkness fall. I think he loves the lady night." Am I alive? Am I dead? Something else? Something in between?
RESUME ERIC: Almost bemused. Steadier. A hint of friendliness.
ERIC: Thanks for sharing that.
GIDEON: Ahhh, jesus, the creatures of the night, here they come. Tweedledum and Tweedledummer. Skank riles
SKANK: Hey, blow me, fat boy! Just as quick, Gideon cocks and levels a Magnum at Skank.
GIDEON: Blow yourself, bigmouth.
GIDEON: Whatcha got?
GIDEON: 18k. Crap.
GIDEON: Nineteen bucks at Sears. Fake,
GIDEON: What's this a little, ah, bloodstain, right? Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm doin' you a
SKANK: You wouldn't want Top Dollar not to smile. Mention of Top Dollar clams Gideon efficiently up. He hands over the cash to T-Bird with a grimace.
ERIC: All right. And he takes off on a run. Only to stumble and fall. But the falls turns into a TUMBLING ROLL that lands Eric back on his feet still moving. He looks back as if to ask: "Did I do that?" and runs out of the frame.
ERIC: He completes the pull-up, bringing his chin level with the ledge. As he reaches for it with his other hand the bracket rips from the wall and Eric plummets, with a howl of defeat.
ERIC: CLOSE-UP - THE CROW Not "your welcome", but other-worldly patience. It waits.
RESUME ERIC: ERIC ( CONT'D ) Where're we going next the EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT Still, dark silence until Eric lands from ABOVE FRAME, feline. The crow lands simultaneously b.g., perched near a roof access door with a shaded, dim-yellow bulb.
ERIC: Are we finished yet?
ALBRECHT: Victim's name is Shelly Webster. The guy who got tossed is, uh . Albrecht grinds out his smoke on the banister.
ERIC: "Draven, Eric."
BOUNCER: Hey! You got any ID?
ELLY: Very funny. Ha. Ha. Oh my, The Bouncer jerks a thumb. Go on in.
ELLY: Mom ?
DARLA: I told you you're not supposed to come in here.
ELLY: ( a quick lie ) I lost my key. Disgustedly goddamn kids Darla fishes up a key and slaps it into Elly's hand.
DARLA: ( to Elly ) Out. Now. I gotta work. RACK PAST Darla and MOVE IN CLOSE on a corner table where sit Funboy, Skank, T-Bird and a black, vested muscle gypsy, TIN-TIN.
ERIC: No! Don't look! No! No! He whirls unexpectedly and punches his fist completely through the masonry wall. FLASH: Eric and Shelly in a mock waltz. He spins her and they collapse on the bed.
ERIC: ( whispering ) Stop it. His eyes roll up and he slumps the length of the door frame like a drowning man.
SKANK: Fuck you, T-Bird. Just as lightning fast, T-Bird has his own gun out and jammed right under Skank's jawbone. He makes a kissy face.
FUNBOY: Hey, pussycat.
FUNBOY: More fun than a torture chamber. Tin-Tin's pocket pager goes BEEP and startles them all. Skank nearly shoots it, jumpy. Tin-Tin pulls back on a black leather trenchcoat after clicking off the pager.
ERIC: We have company.
SKULL COWBOY: Having fun yet? No? I'll give you a hint. Remember Miss her?
ERIC: SKULL COWBOY Miss her?
SKULL COWBOY: Miss her?
ERIC: SKULL COWBOY Kill the men who killed you both, and the Day of the Dead will be your reunion. The Skull Cowboy prestidigitates a flat throwing knife( like Tin- Tin's ). Eric's gaze follow it closely.
SKULL COWBOY: Kill the men who killed you both, and the Day of the Dead will be your reunion. The Skull Cowboy prestidigitates a flat throwing knife( like Tin- Tin's ). Eric's gaze follow it closely.
ERIC: He grabs for the knife as if to use it on the Skull Cowboy, but the knife causes an unexpected painful FLASH. FLASH: Eric bouncing off the bedroom doorframe, Tin-Tin's knife stuck in his shoulder.
RESUME ERIC: vising his head with his hands, in pain. Too much pain.
SKULL COWBOY: Get it?
ERIC: Leave me alone ! He looks up, the Skull Cowboy is still there.
SKULL COWBOY: ( contempt ) Do something about it.
ERIC: I guess I'm not ready to leave. just yet. He picks up the cat wary of flashes, which don't come this time and returns to the window. Feeling safer.
RATSO: Please, TIn-Tin, you know I'm good for the money, man, I promise, Leslie put me up to it, please, man, don't Tin-Tin has just up-rammed a throwing knife into Ratso.
ERIC: Hello, Tin-Tin.
ERIC: Tin-Tin blows out a breath. No bluff. Time to kill again.
ERIC: Try harder. Try again.
ERIC: A year ago. Halloween. A man and a woman. In a loft. You helped to murder them.
ERIC: You cut her. You raped her. You watched!
ERIC: I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.
ERIC: Victims. Aren't we all.
ERIC: Halloween is coming. The Day of the Dead. In the mirror, multi Eric's. He touches the glass, tightening up as he realizes he's in for another FLASH: Shelly, sleeping on her divan, a year ago, wakes as Eric ( O.S. ) says "Boo". She cracks an eye open.
SHELLY: Your scary quotient needs work.
SHELLY: I think red's my color, don't you?
RESUME ERIC: wincing. He drops the lipstick on the floor. Grabs a FLASH: Eric smashes into the street after his death-fall, trailing broken glass.
SKULL COWBOY: Glad to see you're finally with the program.
ERIC: Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
SKULL COWBOY: You work for the dead. Forget that, and you can forget it all. The Cowboy tips his hat and isn't there. Eric sees the crow perched on the edge of the mirror now.
ERIC: Forget this. He smears the streaks until his face is uniformly grave-wave ANGLE - GABRIEL THE CAT coming in to sniff around the clutter at the foot of the vanity. Eric looks down towards him. and toward the lipstick he dropped.
ERIC: She always red red was her color.
ERIC: All right, bad guys.
ERIC: ( in drawn out yell ) Here I commme ! PULL BACK swiftly, vertiginously, as Eric swan dives from the window, his voice a howl.
TORRES: Couldn't have happened to a nicer ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND TORRES OVER DEAD TIN-TIN Tin-Tin frozen in deathshock, all of his knives sticking out of him. Dead Ratso, b.g., where he fell.
ALBRECHT: Sure it coulda. Funboy's not here, neither is T-Bird none of Top Dollar's number ones.
TORRES: You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that's guilty of zip on paper. Top Dollar runs Showtime; what's the matter, don't you like adult entertainment?
ALBRECHT: This sack of shit is called Tin- Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
TORRES: Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
ALBRECHT: He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
TORRES: ( sigh ) This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway. This was somebody else. Somebody new. Albrecht lights a fresh smoke. Torres waves the smoke away.
ALBRECHT: ( sigh ) This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway. This was somebody else. Somebody new. Albrecht lights a fresh smoke. Torres waves the smoke away.
TORRES: And you're gonna tell me who.
ALBRECHT: Who ever made that. Albrecht points. CAMERA FOLLOWS to wall behind Tin-Tin. A crow silhouette has been daubed in blood there, now dry.
TORRES: What in the hell. do you call that?
ALBRECHT: I call it blood, Detective. If you want, you can call it graffiti.
GIDEON: Piss off, we're closed. As the outside security gate rattles, Gideon draws his magnum and approaches the front door.
GIDEON: Fucking creatures of the night; they never goddamn learn. Sudden surprise as he sees the silhouette of the gate SCREE back against the frosted glass of the front door.
HEY!!: And he hustles to close up the distance between himself and the door, gun up. Before he can touch the door, the crowbar comes rocketing through the glass, pegging Gideon in the forehead and knocking him flat on his ass. He loses the pistol. Eric walks through the door, causing the fractured glass to disintegrate around him. He disclaims, thespian.
ERIC: "Suddenly I heard a tapping, as of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door." You heard me rapping, right?
GIDEON: Oh, bullshit! You're trespassing asshole, you're breakin' and enterin' and you just bought me a fucking door! During Gideon's rant, Eric brushes glass cubes from his shoulders, nonplussed. Now he flings Gideon across the room. Gideon crashes into the counter cage. As Eric advances on him:
ERIC: I'm looking for something in an engagement ring. Gold. As Eric comes up behind him, Gideon reaches through the open cage door and pulls a big combat knife from beneath the counter.
GIDEON: You're looking for a coroner,shit- And he tries to nail Eric with the knife.
ERIC: I repeat: a gold engagement ring. It was pawned here, a year ago, by another gentleman whose name, I believe was. "T-Bird"?
GIDEON: ( gasping ) I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
ERIC: Wrong answer. Eric nails Gideon's hand to the counter top. Gideon howls!
GIDEON: All's I got is in a box! Behind the counter! Eric jumps through the cage door. Gideon's eyes bug as he sees his own pierced hand, immobilized.
ERIC: No. no. no. no. He tosses each rejected ring over his shoulder. Until:
RESUMING ERIC: He closes his fist tightly around the ring. A moment of decision. Then he draws the shotgun from beneath the counter. Uses the butt to knock the knife free of Gideon's hand. It goes spinning across the countertop. Eric shucks the shotgun and rams it into Gideon's nose as the big man slumps to the floor.
ERIC: Tin-Tin confided in me, before he ran out of breath. You have one chance to live.
GIDEON: No fucking way. He'll kill me.
ERIC: Who would waste time killing you. besides me? Gideon sweats, pants, contemplates the hole in his hand.
GIDEON: ( cowed ) Top Dollar.
ERIC: Another jolly nickname?
GIDEON: You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.
ERIC: Like the car. He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit hell, Funboy lives there. Ask Top A whole club of pirates, with pirate names. Eric seems to go berserk, SMASHING and PUNCTURING cans of flammables and powder while Gideon flinches, nursing his holed hand. Blows just miss Gideon's head. Soon he's cowering.

ERIC: You feed off the living. SMASH! as another tin ceases to exist next to Gideon. Then Eric is gone, past him without further word, ignoring him entirely. As he exits, shotgun shouldered, he pauses to admire a white Fender Strat hanging among the pawnables. He reaches for it.
ON GIDEON: As he summons some last minute budget bravery.
GIDEON: You walk outta here Top Dollar will erase your ass! Top Dollar owns the fucking street here and you can't dick with me, you son of a bitch!
ERIC: One chance to live. Take it.
ERIC: I thought the police always said Albrecht divides his attention, jumpy, between the odd sight of Eric ( guitar on his back ), and the raging instant inferno of I'm the police and I say don't move, Snow White. You're under arrest; I don't care what else is wrong with you! You move and you're dead. Eric has begun to pace towards Albrecht. Palms up. A gesture of submission. Albrecht's battle calm begins to waiver.
ALBRECHT: I'm the police and I say don't move, Snow White. You're under arrest; I don't care what else is wrong with you! You move and you're dead. Eric has begun to pace towards Albrecht. Palms up. A gesture of submission. Albrecht's battle calm begins to waiver.
ERIC: And I say I'm dead. and I move.
ALBRECHT: No further. I'm serious. Eric bows, bringing his forehead in line with the gun's muzzle.
ERIC: Then shoot, if you will.
ALBRECHT: Are you nuts, walking into a gun?
ERIC: You must listen carefully: the Fire Department will be here soon. There is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance. As Shelly Webster once needed your assistance, and as you are shortly going to need my assistance. Albrecht gestures casually, almost comically, with his pointed gun. B.g., the crow lands on a fire escape to monitor them.
ALBRECHT: You wanna run that back for me one SIRENS near, o.s. Eric listens to them, to the night.
ERIC: Listen: Top Dollar. He "owns the street here." He will "erase my ass."
ALBRECHT: You don't say.
ERIC: I know Top Dollar has turned your streets into his hell.
ALBRECHT: Fucking A, my friend.
ERIC: The others are called Skank, T- Bird. Street names. Funboy. Watch me, office Albrecht. Eric lifts a chunk of glass from the sidewalk. Slow and easy. Albrecht doesn't completely trust him. Up comes the gun.
ALBRECHT: Watch it. Eric slices open his palm. Blood flows. To his fingertips.
ALBRECHT: You're the one who did Tin-Tin. PULL BACK FAST to reveal Eric is gone from the frame. Albrecht does a quick 180. No Eric. Flashbars from incoming units begin to bounce red and blue off his face.
DICKEY BIRD: T-Bird. Thrill me.
TOP DOLLAR: Wild fucking night. I hear our pal Tin-Tin got himself very dead.
TOP DOLLAR: Bet that pisses you off, right?
TOP DOLLAR: Stay normal, T. Cops'll be all hotwired and aggressive. No combat moves until I check this EXT. STREET - NIGHT - ( ~CROWVISION" ) HIGH ANGLE Taking in the street, the Pit, and a little girl seated on an abandoned car.
ELLY: What are you supposed to be? A clown?
ERIC: He glances back and logs the location of the Pit for later, not in a big hurry just now. Turns back to Elly.
ELLY: You look like a rock star without a I dabble. May I? He indicates the car hood, a "seat" next to Elly from which he may observe the Pit.
ERIC: I dabble. May I? He indicates the car hood, a "seat" next to Elly from which he may observe the Pit.
ELLY: If you're not some kinda child Eric looks behind himself. Who, me? Genuinely amused. He shakes his head no and sits down next to Elly.
TOP DOLLAR: I thought Halloween was tomorrow An Oriental bodyguard passes him in f.g., motioning to follow.
TOP DOLLAR: Get outta my way, you mooks. Lao's demeanor indicates that they should not kill Top.
LAO: An unexpected pleasure.
TOP DOLLAR: Bad news. Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me. Tin- Tin got himself whacked.
LAO: Who got himself what?
TOP DOLLAR: One of mine. And it wasn't a standard hit.
LAO: I had heard something like this. Describe it for me. The "hit".
TOP DOLLAR: I was wondering if you could tell me anything. about a wildcat I know of no one. But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
LAO: I know of no one. But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
TOP DOLLAR: Anybody violates my turf our turf I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
LAO: To be sure. Now tell how your friend died.
ANNABELLA: Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie. I'm too busy tonight.
ALBRECHT: Annie, I need a file. There is a desperate edge to Albrecht's voice.
ANNABELLA: Speak up. Clear it with the Captain if you need a file.
ALBRECHT: This is special, darlin'. Please? Annabella eyes Albrecht doubtfully. Fatalistic sigh.
ANNABELLA: Just don't tell me you "owe me one." What file?
ALBRECHT: Double homicide. A year ago. Las Halloween.
ELLY: My mom works over there. I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.
ERIC: Mister Funboy.
ELLY: Mister Funboy.
ERIC: Mister Funboy lives there?
ELLY: He has a room, upstairs. I don't like him very much. Elly is not happy about this. B.G. we see Grange get out of the car, heading to the Pit, and notice in passing a guy with the white face talking to the little girl down on the block.
ERIC: I can pick out a tune now and again.
ELLY: Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?" It used to be her favorite.
ERIC: Does she have a name?
ELLY: No name. You sure ask a lot of Elly HANDS the doll to Eric and he experiences a wholly unexpected flash. FLASH: Elly and SHelly sitting as SHelly's vanity, goofing with makeup, test-driving lipstick, the doll visible on the vanity.
ERIC: You gotta go now, I bet.
ELLY: You gotta go now, I bet.
ERIC: I have to go. Half-zomboid, half-determined, he exits.
GRANGE: Top Dollar?
BOUNCE: Never heard of him.
GRANGE: Oh, prob'ly upstairs bangin' Darla. Pay for your own beer and they'll prob'ly be down before you can drink it.
BOUNCER: Oh, prob'ly upstairs bangin' Darla. Pay for your own beer and they'll prob'ly be down before you can drink it.
ANNABELLA: Don't thank me. Your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit.
ALBRECHT: I knew that. Albrecht holds a typewritten page closer to the the light. CLOSE-UP DOCUMENT, torn by the knife hole made by Tin-Tin. It reads: We, the Undersigned tenants of 1929 Calderone Court Another nice white girl with a cause. Like a big KICK ME sign. Albrecht takes up and 8x10 of Eric's face.
ALBRECHT: Another nice white girl with a cause. Like a big KICK ME sign. Albrecht takes up and 8x10 of Eric's face.
ANNABELLA: Your last little wild goose chase got you busted back to the Beat Patrol, just like in a bad detective story, Eddie. Are we doing the wildgoose thing again? UNDER THIS Albrecht sketches in Eric's spiky Crow hairdo.
ALBRECHT: Could be.
ANNABELLA: You gonna wind up working at a school crosswalk. that doughnut's chocolate you, know. PUSH IN on the doctored photo. It's Eric. It's the Crow. PUSH IN on ALbrecht.
ALBRECHT: Well, hello there.chocolate,
ANNABELLA: Don't thank me.
ALBRECHT: Thanks, babe.
ERIC: It's a Raymond Chandler evening And the pavements are all wet, And I'm lurking in the shadows, for it hasn't happened .
DARLA: Ooh, baby gimme all of it.
DARLA: It's a big fucking bird. She falls back against her pillow, eyes dreamily defocusing. Funboy giggles. Relaxes the gun, which half-disappears into the sheets at his side.
FUNBOY: It's a squab. Here bird, Here, NEW ANGLE - DARLA AND FUNBOY Except that Eric now stands near their bed, across from the bird's position, the guitar bowslung.
ERIC: Here Funboy. Contained panic as Funboy and Darla both startle. The needle flies and lands at Eric's feet. Empty. Funboy struggles to maintain against his high.
FUNBOY: Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do that, man. I nearly had a fucking heart attack.
DARLA: Fun look at that guy.
FUNBOY: It's just the dope, don't worry
DARLA: Fun, he's not going away; he's scaring the piss outta me!
FUNBOY: Not me. Funboy draws the gun from underneath the sheers. Suddenly he seems totally focused.
ERIC: Take your shot funboy. You got me, dead bang. Funboy tilts the gun off target. Grins as Eric flat handedly past his chest, indicating where to shoot.
FUNBOY: You are seriously fucked up, man. Just look at yourself. In a blur, he sighs, and shoots Eric through the heart.
ERIC: Bull's eye. Good shot.
ERIC: Eric twists her arm.
ERIC: Morphine is bad for you. He holds her arm captive. Tight, and we PUSH IN CLOSER to see the dope evacuating from the punctures, a reverse of Eric's, Blood trail. The dope drips from Darla's arm to the floor. Darla's eyes roll up into the unconscious. She slumps.
FUNBOY: How the hell did you do that?
ERIC: Funboy regards Eric's battlescars and guitar.
FUNBOY: Either die or do a solo. Eric looks briefly to his chest wound, wincing. He can't seem to make it tie off fast enough. He turns his attention back to Funboy. But his strength is mysteriously ebbing.
ERIC: Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself. Funboy lashes out and broadsides Eric across the temple with the gun. Eric falls, rolls back to a stance, but Funboy is right on top of him, howling like a lunatic and pistol-whipping Eric I hate trespassers! I hate prowlers! I hate peeping toms! And right now I hate you!
FUNBOY: Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself. Funboy lashes out and broadsides Eric across the temple with the gun. Eric falls, rolls back to a stance, but Funboy is right on top of him, howling like a lunatic and pistol-whipping Eric I hate trespassers! I hate prowlers! I hate peeping toms! And right now I hate you!
FUNBOY: I hate trespassers! I hate prowlers! I hate peeping toms! And right now I hate you!
FUNBOY: Ahh, the hell with it, I still got five shots left. In a blur, Eric grabs Funboy`s gun hand. Twists to the crunching of bones. Funboy's skewed-around gun hand blows a hole in his own thigh. Funboy fall back across the bed.
FUNBOY: Owwwaaaa fuck me! Look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit! AAAAaa! Goddd!
ERIC: Does it hurt?
FUNBOY: Does it hurt?! You dead-ass, clown-faced fuck, of course it fucking hurts! What the shit are you gonna do about this?! Eric sits on the bed next to Funboy; inspects the ampule of morphine on the nightstand, the needle of the syringe already I have some pain killer right here. And he fills the syringe all the way.
ERIC: I have some pain killer right here. And he fills the syringe all the way.
FUNBOY: No, wait, no WAIT, that's too much, man, that's like overkill, nobody can take that much, you're wasting it !
ERIC: Your pain ends now. And Eric rams the needle into Funboy's heart, driving home the full dose. Funboy begins to convulse. Eric falls back on the bed, his force spent. Darla COMES TO in the corner, shock-traumatized. On O.S. COUGH, and Eric opens his eyes. The Skull Cowboy, standing in the room, tips his hat.
SKULL COWBOY: ( beat ) You look a mess. Like an ole cooter dog.
SKULL COWBOY: Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?
ERIC: Go away.
SKULL COWBOY: You need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going.
ERIC: Shut up.
SKULL COWBOY: Maybe I was wrong about you. The Skull Cowboy seems saddened or disappointed. All we get is a little shake of his skull-head. Darla makes a SOUND and Eric turns toward her. She's really confused. She's looking to Eric for some kind of answer.
ERIC: Your daughter is out there, on the street, waiting for you. She's stunned, utterly speechless. All she can do is look in Eric's eyes, try to ponder the phantoms there.
ERIC: Go. Now. Darla shoves helter-skelter past Eric and out the door without a glance back at Funboy. Eric, recovering, follows slowly, staring at the open door, stooping to lift the guitar dropped during the fight with Funboy. The Skull Cowboy has vanished. PUSH IN. Grimly, Eric takes a syringe and begins to draw blood from the late Funboy.
BOUNCER: Hey, g'night, Darla. That there is Darla.
GRANGE: Bartender indicates UP with his thumb. Grange moves to the fire stairs door.
RESUME GRANGE: Eyes darting, drawn to
RESUME GRANGE: whirling with his gun to bring it to bear on
ERIC: Albrecht startles; drops his file. Nearly draws his gun.
ALBRECHT: Jeezus! Don't ever do that, man! Albrecht pants, hysterical but calming down. Eric waits.
ERIC: I saw it, too. Albrecht gathers up the file. Eric stands there. We realize he is hesitant about touching the file.
ALBRECHT: You died, man. I can't believe it but here you are. Last year, you and your girlfriend
ERIC: I need you to tell me what you remember. What happened to us?
ALBRECHT: You went out the window. She was beaten and raped. She died in the They stop. Eric didn't know this. Fixes Albrecht with a look.
ALBRECHT: You okay, man? I mean, what just The venom of bad memories. You were there; you saw her. I saw you seeing her. Understandable nervous, Albrecht lights up a cigarette.
ERIC: The venom of bad memories. You were there; you saw her. I saw you seeing her. Understandable nervous, Albrecht lights up a cigarette.
ALBRECHT: You gotta understand I was hoping she'd talk, give me a lead, a clue, something to work with. But she only said one thing to me before she died. Eric lowers his head, penitent.
ERIC: My name.
ALBRECHT: ( fizzles ) I'm sorry as hell, man.
ERIC: Thirty hours. A day of life, plus TIGHT TWO-SHOT - ALBRECHT AND ERIC Eric plucks the cigarette from Albrecht's lips, taking a single contemplative puff from it.
ERIC: Halloween is coming, soon. You will have Top Dollar if you watch for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night.
ALBRECHT: I should be trying to stop you. Eric nods, keeping his eyes on the cigarette.
ERIC: Thank you. For giving a damn.
ALBRECHT: My pleasure.
ERIC: Don't smoke these. As a bus grumbles past on the street, Eric pitches the butt and simultaneously ducks out of frame.
ALBRECHT: Damn, I wish he wouldn't do that.
GRANGE: The son of a bitch winked at me. The he jumped. Three stories. Lao seems strangely unaffected by the bizarre nature of Grange's Did you see an animal of any kind? Did you see a bird?
LAO: Did you see an animal of any kind? Did you see a bird?
GRANGE: ( puzzled ) No. I saw a guitar. ( beat; irritated ) This isn't some rock-n-roller you forgot to pay, is it? ( beat ) There was a drawing on the wall that looked like a bird. In Lao's expression is one of sublime content.
LAO: It could've been a chicken.
SKANK: I wish to hell I had torched Gideon's, that fat fuck.
SKANK: Got it. Skank hustles toward the store. T-Bird crosses to the car.
ERIC: I'm your passenger. You drive. And stop talking.
SKANK: What's all this happy horseshit? And the car peels out maniacally! Skank tries to pursue but the two KIDS draw weapons and freeze everyone in the store.
AXEL: Alright, alright, alright everybody be cool and stay exactly where you are. Chopper hustles up to the counter and relieves Skank of a gigantic Auto Mag.
CHOPPER: Whooooa, cowboy! Cool gun. Off Skank's look of total outfoxed disgust.
ERIC: That's good. We're going someplace you've never been EXT. STREET - HIGH ANGLE ON T-BIRD - NIGHT as the car burns up the obstacle course of pavement, kicking wake of litter. PEDESTRIANS scurry to clear the way.
MJ: Smells like rain.
SPEEG: Smells like a septic tank. You got that cream stuff?
MJ: In the bag. Speeg rummages inside the takeout bag.
SPEEG: I hate this cream stuff. They can't even call it cream, legally. They snap to as the T-Bird blazes past, doing ninety.
MJ: What in the crap? MJ floors the pedal, drenching Speeg in coffee on takeoff.
SPEEG: Ow! Owowoowowoowo, goddammit!
ERIC: You caught one. Drive faster.
ERIC: I want you to stop talking. And drive. Drive faster. Eric rifles the glove box, tossing items out the window: clips for the gun. Sunglasses. A giant dildo ( brief eyebrows-up to T-Bird ). Then: a roll of ( previously established ) gaffer's tape. What Eric needs.
ERIC: ( wry ) INSERT - SPEEDOMETER Climbing swiftly toward the 100 mark.
ERIC: Time for your reward, T. Payback with interest earned. Eric rips a long strip of tape from the roll.
ERIC: A little restrictive? Good. You held her down and raped her. You were the first. She burned while you were inside of her. What's the lag on this? About twenty seconds, would you say? T-bird thrashes, but he's immobilized. Can't even budge the I've comrades in hell, T-bird. Give them my best. Eric activates the timer. Yanks up hard on the bungie cord.
ERIC: All gone.
DARLA: I never was too good at this domestic shit.
ELLY: Don't say "shit". That's okay. Corn Flakes are okay. Anything. She pauses as she hears a lilting, faraway GUITAR STRAIN. Across the street she can make out the figure of Eric on his roof playing the guitar.
MICKEY: Chili dog for breakfast. it's Mom tried to cook.
ELLY: Mom tried to cook.
MICKEY: CUSTOMER ( O.S. ) Hey, Mickey, I need a special with everything. No sawdust.
MICKEY: ( to Elly ) Everyone's a comedian. Enjoy. Mickey EXITS FRAME.
ELLY: A lot of people "know" my mom. Grange points o.s., indicating he wants coffee from Mickey.
GRANGE: I know your friend, too the one that looks like a rock star.
ELLY: I don't know you.
GRANGE: ( easily ) I'd like to get in touch with him. Elly sizes Grange up.
ELLY: You're not a cop, either. What do you want him for?
GRANGE: I'm looking for a good guitar man.
ELLY: Grange withdraws a $10 bill from his wallet and slides it across the countertop to Mickey.
GRANGE: I need to find him kind of soon, INT. LOFT - ON ERIC - DAY No shirt, the ring on the thong around his neck workout mode. He twirls and performs odd Crow moves of increasing complexity in the big open living room. On purpose, he stretches hard against the bedroom doorframe. FLASH: Shelly stands in the blue moonlight near the picture window wearing a rococo Victorian gown. PUSH IN TIGHT as she is embraced by a nude Eric. He undoes the last few remaining ties that hold the gown in place. FOLLOW THE GOWN as it crumples down the length of Shelly's ( also otherwise nude ) body to the LOW ANGEL - FROM INSIDE THE BEDROOM - ON ERIC hanging there, inviting the pain the FLASHES bring. Breathing as though he is pumping iron, pumping up.
ERIC: That's better. He wipes his torso down with a towel.
SKANK: Top, I made the sumbitch! Face all painted white like some kinda fuckin' kabuki homo! WIDE ANGLE to include all present: Lao, Grange, Lao Guards #1 and #2, Top Dollar, and a Sentry. Top dusts up a line and rinses his nostrils with brandy.
LAO: Sounds like our "Crow" is out-maneuvering you.
TOP DOLLAR: "Our" Crow.?
LAO: Come now. You've seen the graffiti all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. What about your turf, Top? You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet.
TOP DOLLAR: ( pissed off ) The night is young.
SKANK: ( hot ) The found T-bird flash-fried to what was left of his fucking car! Top is angry too, but won't show it to Lao. He rises and goes to the window. Neon glow. Top sees something outside, below, that really torques him off.
TOP DOLLAR: Hey, you little fuckweed! That's against the law! His gun smoking. Momentary empowerment.
LAO: I am sitting over here. He SLAMS a palm on the table and the room goes silent. Top looks sheepish.
TOP DOLLAR: Nice speech. What's it supposed to mean?
LAO: Your comprehension is not required. Your cooperation and, indeed, your ability are the issues on the table. Top rallies to this.
TOP DOLLAR: Whatever you say, I can do. Skank looks around, nervous and jumpy, a contradiction to Top's That's reassuring.
LAO: That's reassuring.
SKANK: What was that !? It wasn't anything. Skank loads, stands and jacks the action on his gun. Lao looks questioningly to Top Dollar.
TOP DOLLAR: Too many poppers, Skank. Relax. Heel.
TOP DOLLAR: ( awed but maintained ) You want my attention, man you got it.
SKANK: It's him, Top! He dusted T-Bird!
ERIC: You have to be SKank. One moment. As he speaks, WIDEN FRAME as he turns and grabs the incoming Skank by the hair.
ERIC: Thank of a snappy comeback for me on your way down. Without a beat he pitches Skank right out the window! Skank howls all the way down.
MJ: OwwwAAHHH son of a BITCH!
ALBRECHT: Jesus Christ. He runs to assist the demolished cruiser.
ERIC: Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air.
TOP DOLLAR: Five large, in the drawer right over there. I never saw you.
ERIC: Do you know what you destroyed?
TOP DOLLAR: Take the dope, too. Eric backhands Top into the wall. Gets in his face, seething.
ERIC: A year ago. A very nice lady circulated a petition. She died. Last Halloween. Answer yes or no.
TOP DOLLAR: That's ancient history.
ERIC: It's yesterday! Do you know what you destroyed? Top Dollar yells right back at Eric's anger.
TOP DOLLAR: Who gives a fuck! I'm a businessman. You gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face!
ERIC: You don't even remember.
TOP DOLLAR: I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition. It got a little rowdy. end of Rowdy. Let me fill in some gaps for you. And he grabs Top's head the way he grabbed ALbrecht's earlier, slams Top into the wall. Nose-to-nose. FLASH: Shelly backing away from oncoming Funboy in the loft, trying to retreat, nowhere to run, her home invaded, scared.
ERIC: Rowdy. Let me fill in some gaps for you. And he grabs Top's head the way he grabbed ALbrecht's earlier, slams Top into the wall. Nose-to-nose. FLASH: Shelly backing away from oncoming Funboy in the loft, trying to retreat, nowhere to run, her home invaded, scared.
ERIC: You're a detail man, Top you need to see more. This time Top tries to twist from Eric's grasp but it's no good. FLASH: Shelly, comatose in ICU, eyes fixed and staring, hoses darting in and out, cold blue refrigerator light. Bloody, bruised and broken ( from Albrecht;s memory )
ERIC: All of her pain, Top. Thirty hours. All at once. Eric bears down on Top Dollar again. Top screams. Blood begins to leak from his eyes, nose, ears.
ERIC: I didn't think you could handle it O.S. BANG of impact, heavy against the steel door. Eric turns.
LEAD SWAT: That's all she wrote, Bozo! You stand down now, and that's an ANGLE - ERIC AS HE MOVES using his foot to shove the massive conference table at the incoming SWATS while launching himself into the air, flipping toward the window and arching through cleanly as the cops open fire on command. Bullets tear the room to pieces.
LEAD SWAT: The fire escape's covered.
LEAD SWAT: Holy shit, it's spiderman. He tries to pull a bead and fires too late.
LEAD SWAT: Dammit to hell! Come on.
ALBRECHT: ( from car ) Come on!
ALBRECHT: Keep your head down! He twists and turns the car, glancing rearward for pursuit. Gradually he calms down.
ERIC: It's done.
ALBRECHT: I figured as much. Did you cap off Funboy.
ERIC: Funboy had to leave this mortal Yeah, among others. Hey, man you're hit.
ALBRECHT: Yeah, among others. Hey, man you're hit.
ERIC: It's only a flesh wound.
ALBRECHT: It's only fourteen or fifteen flesh wounds. Eric sits up as the car gains distance. Grabs the cigarette out of ALbrecht's mouth. Takes his single puff.
ERIC: You shouldn't smoke these. He pitches the smoke out the open car window.
ALBRECHT: Great. Litterbug of the Living Eric turns back to Albrecht.
ERIC: I'm finished. Eric shoots him a doubtful look.
ALBRECHT: ( not buying it ) ( beat ) You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward?
ALBRECHT: You're gonna kill somebody else. We're gonna stop and get a shit-load of Band-Aids? Eric is obviously fighting to stay centered, stay conscious. His last fight has caused him a great deal of damage, taken a lot out of him. He needs to recharge.
ERIC: I have to prepare for an anniversary. This coming night. HOLD on their two kinds of determination. as we
GRANGE: What. the hell is that?
LAO: ( calmly ) This is a cobra, Mr. Grange. Yes, it is real.
GRANGE: That thing is poisonous.
LAO: Extremely so. You and I are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling The Crow. Grange makes a face. Can't keep his eyes off the cobra.
GRANGE: Give me a break. That guy's a wacko.
LAO: I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is. I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
GRANGE: Not a Plymouth Fury, I bet. Lao chuckles indulgently.
LAO: Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course.
GRANGE: Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
LAO: Mmm. But tonight I can take what is his.
GRANGE: Only thing you'll get from that clown is a faster way to die.
LAO: To the contrary. ZZLIP! Lao smoothly BEHEADS the snake with the Blade against the stone surface of the desk and discards the writhing body. He squeezes behind one of the eyes and a VENOM SAC protrudes like a dark pimento. LAO pulls it free of the milky, clinging tissue and EATS IT. Off Grange's stunned expression.
GRANGE: Kill a dead guy? Lao POPS the second venom sac; swallows it. Pleased.
LAO: Truly kill him. So I may crush his skull and smoke it. Lao SHRUGS. Grange can handle it.
RESUME ERIC: Without looking toward the door, he speaks.
ELLY: What's going on.?
ERIC: A remembrance. A closure. And Eric consigns to the fire the DRESS we saw earlier. Holds a photograph in a broken frame. Cracked glass. Subject: Eric and Shelly, goofing for the camera. He chucks it into the fire. Draws a deep breath.
ERIC: Better now. I feel good. How are you, Elly, my friend? Elly is clearly uncomfortable, groping for an excuse just to see Eric. Eric is staring at her, intently.
ERIC: What is it?
ELLY: I knew. I knew I knew you. Even with the makeup and stuff you You really loved her, didn't you?
ERIC: You brought flowers. As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she She's dead. She's gone. And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too. I hate this place; it isn't fair.
ELLY: ( upset ) She's dead. She's gone. And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too. I hate this place; it isn't fair.
ERIC: He draws her close. Wipes away an errant tear with his thumb.
ELLY: You look funny without your white face on. Like it's your day off or something. He quizzical expression amuses him.
ERIC: Somebody here wants to meet you. Gabriel? Gabriel the cat has wandered near the fireplace to join them. Elly is immediately smitten. Happy.
ELLY: I remember him! Here, Gabriel. here kitty. Gabriel. Is he still yours?
ERIC: I think he's yours, now. The cat seems to like that idea. Elly wraps him hugely up in her arms, talking to him: "How're you, Gabriel, whatcha doin'"
ELLY: Nobody ever gave me something like that before. Ever. Eric places it around her neck. Elly BEAMS.
ERIC: Shelly would've wanted you to have it. This way, you'll think of her every time you see it.
ELLY: And she'll be alive. Up here. Elly TAPS her own temple with a smile, keeping one hand on the EXT. STREET - DAY Blowing wind. TRICK-OR-TREATERS wisp past. Ghosts, witches, demons out for Halloween.
ELLY: You're gonna like it here. A car curbs across the street as she enters the building.
DARLA: I was wonderin' where you'd gotten to Oh, Elly, honey, a cat. Here?
ELLY: He was a present. Besides, we're moving anyway. You said.
DARLA: We'll discuss this later. Obviously. You left the door open. DARLA points. As Elly goes to close the door it opens.
GRANGE: Hi, Elly. Remember me? Elly's surprise is evident. Darla is just plain pissed off.
DARLA: I don't remember you. And I don't remember inviting.
GRANGE: ( to his MEN ) If she opens her face again, shoot her in the head.
ELLY: ( panicked ) Mom !
GRANGE: You should listen to your mother. She said no cats. Grange pitches Gabriel right out the window.
ELLY: Grange pulls out a compact Polaroid camera.
GRANGE: Now that's the expression I want.
CREATURE KID: Trick or treat! Eric smiles. Not tonight.
SKULL COWBOY: Stop screwing around.
ERIC: Tell me I'll get hurt. That I might die. I've already done that. I don't need anyone's help. Yours STAIR ANGLE - ERIC AND SKULL COWBOY Eric lower, Skull Cowboy superior, the storm wild around them.
SKULL COWBOY: Do this thing and you will be vulnerable. The blood will not No powers. No reunion. Nothing.
ERIC: Fine with me. He ADVANCES a step up; the Skull Cowboy Hold fast.
SKULL COWBOY: You'll be alone.
ERIC: I'm already alone.
GRANGE: We've got company.
RESUME GRANGE: As he talks into his mike he hefts a nightscoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle.
GRANGE: He's just out front talking to himself. You tell me.
ERIC: Don't waste my time.
SKULL COWBOY: Very well, it's your ass. And the wind kicks up around them both, powerfully.
ERIC: But why are you still here?
ERIC: I can see her.
LAO: Of course you can. ANGLE - GRANGE IN THE GALLERY in darkness. The running lights on his night-scoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle which THROWS vague sprays of eerie red and green light.
GRANGE: ( into headset ) Move in, guys. HIGH ANGLE - THE SANCTUARY as Lao Guards #3 and #4 move into light, closing on Eric's position in the center of isle. Both wield calico's and one bears a sword. CLOSE ANGLE - ALTER Lao makes his entrance from shadow wearing a brisk pugilist get-up, a practical fighting outfit. Makes a show of drawing the killing blade.
LAO: I wish to possess what you have now.
ERIC: I want the girl. Unharmed. Now.
LAO: I know. That is why I will prevail. Mr. Grange. ? Eric CRAMPS UP, CLUTCHING his throat in obvious pain.
LAO: Sooner or later, my action were destined to bring me a genuine Fury. And it turned out to be you. At last. I appreciate your abilities as few mortals can. That's why I desire them.
ERIC: You're too late. There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to. But he turned to dust and blew away. I don't have any power for you to take.
LAO: I don't believe that. Lao motions to Grange with the killing blade. Grange RELAXES his deathgrip on the crow. MOVE IN CLOSE on Eric so we may perceive a palpable degree of relief.
ALBRECHT: Had to go get yourself hip-deep in shit, didn't you, my friend. It begins to rain. Albrecht glances resentfully toward the Give it a rest, huh? A hefts a machinegun, clipped over and under. CUTS LOOSE on full auto into the Madonna on the window.
LAO: I said no shooting! Then he's ducking bullets himself as Albrecht STEPS IN through the blown out window, the machine gun stuttering on slugs. The sanctuary comes apart around Lao. He RETREATS to the alter and EXITS whence he came. TIGHT ON PEW ERIC DIVES just as Guard #4 comes after him with the sword, which chomps into the wood and gets stuck there. Guard #4 releases it and cross draws his Calico as ERIC springs back into the frame STRAIGHT UP. TIGHT ON GUARD #4 as Eric's lancing foot propels him backward before he can fire. INTERCUTS ALBRECHT AND GUARD #3 scrambling to reload. Guard changes magazine; Albrecht swaps clips. ANGLE - DOWN LENGTH OF PEW Guard #4 slides. Sits up with his gun as Eric, down-pew, grabs the sword. ANGLE - ALBRECHT AT WINDOW firing now with a gun in each hand. RESUME ERIC AND GUARD #4, who eats it from Albrecht's gunfire, but not before he puts a round through Eric. Eric staggers back from the impact but keeps his feet. RESUME ALBRECHT as he tosses away the dry pistol. His machine gun jams, he fights to get the clip. ANGLE - GUARD #3 reloaded and rising, having caught Albrecht dead-bang in the open by the window. MOVING ANGLE - WITH ERIC A complex leap with the sword flashing. He lands near Guard #3 and SLASHES UPWARDS, blade up. CLOSE-UP - GUARD #3 screaming in pain, gaping DOWN O.S. TIGHT ON ALBRECHT - looking UP, following the trajectory of something AIRBORNE toward him. CLOSE-UP - GUARD #3'S Calico spinning mid-air with Guard #3s HANDS still attached, severed mid-forearm by Eric's devastating ANGLE - ALBRECHT drops Guard #3 to REVEAL Eric in the background. Eric salutes Albrecht with the tip of the sword. WITH ALBRECHT as he moves into the nave, which has been torn apart by gunfire. Hazy smoke. Two dead guys. And Eric.
ALBRECHT: You sorta looked like you might need my help.
ERIC: This isn't your place. This isn't your fight. And I don't need your help.
ALBRECHT: You're welcome.
ERIC: Leave here. Don't do this. I don't want you here.
ALBRECHT: The hell you say. This isn't just about you any more. Eric stares dead-on at Albrecht, acidly, then BREAKS the Guard's sword, dropping the pieces and turning his back on Albrecht, who pursues Eric to:
ERIC: Don't interfere.
ALBRECHT: You're bleeding, man. You can't make it. Eric shinnies up the bellrope, ignoring Albrecht.
ON ALBRECHT: Watching as Eric dissappears from view, fast.. Grumbles.
ALBRECHT: You won't mind if I just take the stairs, then, smartass. He hefts his arsenal bag of hardware and begins to plod up the ANGLE - MOVING WITH ERIC ON THE ROPE A weird perspective of speed climb. Zip! All the way to the top.
ERIC: Here I am. DOWNFRAME lightning STRIKES the ornate LIGHTNING ROD ( large, Victorian, lance-like ) at the far end of the roof from the bell SILHOUETTING Lao and Elly standing in front of it. Elly flinches at the strike.
LAO: Can you fly, Crow man?
ALBRECHT: I ain't cut out for this superhero EXT. CHURCH ROOF - RESUMING LAO - NIGHT Lao SNAPS Elly's free handcuff to the dimly glowing lightning rod and advances, one foot on either side of the peak of the roof, his blade brandished. CLOSE MOVING SHOT - ERIC Hands up to grapple, but weaponless. He spiders to meet Lao, suddenly PICKING UP SPEED and RUNNING along the precarious peak. Lao sees him coming, braces to strike, but Eric executes a BROAD FLYING LEAP right over Lao's head. ERIC LANDS, SLIPS, sprawls sideways, clinging to the peak of the roof. Lao hurries in to slash with the blade, as Eric averts. The steel RINGS. Eric converts his dodge into a low spin kick that DUMPS Lao. Eric SPREAD-EAGLES to keep from falling. Distantly, Lao similarly saves himself. NEW ANGLE THE FIGHT Here comes Lao, crabbing back toward the peak. Eric ROLLS to Elly's position, GRABS the lightning rod and tries to wrest it loose. SIZZLE OF FLESH as Eric's hands are scorched: the metal is still MOVING WITH LAO as Eric battles to free the lightning rod. Lao closes up distance, gives a warcry and prepares to swing as - Eric WRENCHES the rod loose and turns to deflect Lao's blow. The weapons spark as they meet. and there goes Elly, her handcuff freed, SLIDING DOWN THE ROOF SLOPE. ANGLE ROOF SLOPE WITH ERIC as he dodges Lao by using the lightning rod to vault down to where Elly is about to slip off the roof. With the rod embedded in the roof, Eric hangs on, and elly hangs on to Eric. UP ANGLE LAO, a dark figure against the night sky, raising the sword.
LAO: Face me! Eric guides Elly to the top of one of the flying buttresses. When he looks up, Lao is gone. ANGLE - BELL TOWER Albrecht's head pokes up at last. Looks around, finally spots Eric below and to the left. YELLS, serio-comic.
ALBRECHT: Is he dead yet? INSERT - ALBRECHT'S HOLSTER as Lao's hand draws Albrecht's gun quickly. ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND LAO Lao has blindsided Albrecht.
LAO: No. You are. He jams the gun into the base of ALbrecht's neck and fires three times. CLOSE ANGLE - ERIC - He's too far away to matter. Shock. INSERT - ALBRECHT'S CIGARETTE as it rolls down the slope, trailing sparks, snuffing out. ANGLE - ERIC holding onto the lightning rod as lightning CUTS the night above him. ANGLE LAO AT BELL TOWER, triumphant and a bit wild, SHOUTING.
LAO: You've caused another death, Mister Draven! The girl will die as well because of you!
ELLY: You go to hell, you pervert!
RESUME ERIC: Rage over the loss of Albrecht. He RISES, hurting but mad as hell. GLARES UP toward Lao.
ERIC: And how many lives have you destroyed?
LAO: I took yours from you. Your little girlfriend? I took hers, too. Your meaningless, petty life? I took it so that tonight your existence might gain a purpose. You're no avenger. You're mine.
ERIC: ( to himself ) You're right, I'm not an avenger. Not any more. As lightning strikes, Eric Fires his gaze TOWARD THE SKY.
ERIC: Time for a sacrifice. Lao's face is a hideous bloody mask with black holes where the eyes used to be. He smiles gruesomely.
LAO: I don't need eyes to take what I want from you. He EMBRACES Eric and RAMS the killing blade deep into Eric's ON ERIC as he looks down to see the blade protruding from his sternum. Tight grimace. A lot of pain.
ERIC: Can you fly? He pulls Lao into a BACKWARD ROLL down the roof, HOLDING HIM
ELLY: Don't let me fall! CLOSE-UP their hands finally meet and GRASP TIGHT.
ELLY: Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.
ERIC: In a better place. I hope.
ELLY: You're not gonna come back, are you? Eric's response is halting and uncertain. But he tries to give her hope. He reaches for Shelly's ring around her neck, holds it up to her.
ERIC: I don't know if I can. But you have this. and you know where to come.
ELLY: You mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave? Euww. Eric is amused by this in spite of his grievous injuries. He grasps Elly's face in his hands and bends, painfully,to kiss her on the forehead.
ERIC: For you, I'll try. Promise.
ERIC: Leave me now.
DARLA: Worktime, kiddo. First day, new job, gotta go. This does not get the expected smile from Elly.
DARLA: At least it finally stopped It can't rain all the time. Darla kisses Elly on the temple and it out the door. Elly OPENS her hand to consider the ring. She looks back out the window
ELLY: It can't rain all the time. Darla kisses Elly on the temple and it out the door. Elly OPENS her hand to consider the ring. She looks back out the window
