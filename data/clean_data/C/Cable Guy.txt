STEVE: Jesus, where's the cable guy already?
STEVEN: 2 NEWSROOM - CONTINUOUS We see Steven's best friend RICK standing in the middle of a busy newsroom. He is a rough looking, cynical local news cameraman. In the background, hanging from the ceiling is a television ON THE TV - An anchorman sits at his desk fixing his hair as he waits to go on the air. A graphic on the screen says "Sam Sweet Trial Update."
RICK: 3 INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS Steven unpacks as they speak. The phone call intercuts between the two locations.
STEVEN: action. Apparently he's going to be here sometime between eight AM and my death.
RICK: Please tell me you didn't call her.
STEVEN: No, I'm giving her space. ( beat ) I can't believe she's doing this.

STEVEN: 8 INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - LATER Steven paces back and forth across the room. He stares at his watch frequently.
STEVEN: Forget it. Idiots. He gets up, and walks into the bathroom.
STEVEN: Oh great.
STEVEN: 12 INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Steven runs to the door.
STEVEN: The Cable Guy turns back.
CABLE GUY: just gonna go collect my retirement The Cable Guy wears a clean white jump suit, and is extremely confident despite the fact that he speaks with a slight lisp. This lisp gives him a child-like quality.
STEVEN: CABLE GUY place, but now it's closed.
CABLE GUY: place, but now it's closed.
STEVEN: place, but now it's closed.
CABLE GUY: ( turns to leave ) Maybe I shouldn't have come at all  jerk ( turns back smiling ) I'm just joking. Let's do this. ( looks around ) Oh, the old McNair place. I never thought they'd get the floors clean after what happened here.
STEVEN: CABLE GUY They had a lot of cats. They walk into Steven's living room.

CABLE GUY: can access the floorboards. Don't be spooked if you hear someone crawling underneath you.
STEVEN: Steven walks toward his bedroom.
CABLE GUY: channel surfing in no time. The Cable Guy pulls the trigger on his drill twice to punctuate his joke.
RIKKI KLIEMAN: So ends day fifty-four of the trial of former child star Sam Sweet who has been accused of shooting his twin brother, Stan, in cold blood. The twins were stars of the hit sitcom "Double Trouble" which aired from nineteen seventy-seven till nineteen eighty-four. A video package rolls in - We see several photographs of Sam Sweet and his twin brother at various ages. Included is the cast photo of "Double Trouble." Pictured in the photo are eight-year- old Stan and Sam and Conrad Janis as their single dad. We see a brief clip from "Double Trouble," starring the two eight-year-old boys, then a shot of Sam Sweet being taken out of a police car in handcuffs.
RIKKI KLIEMAN: Life wasn't so sweet after the cancellation of their program. Hollywood chewed them up and spit them out. A frustrated Sam turned to petty larceny, while his more impressionable brother, Stan, fell in with a fringe cult called "The Brotherhood of Friends." Reduced to tabloid fodder a fury was growing inside of Sam. A burning need to be recognized as an individual, not a person famous for having an identical twin. A need that took the form of four shotgun blasts on the night of November fourteenth. And so today his attorneys continue the unusual defense of "Twin Envy."
ANGLE ON: Steven re-enters the room. The Cable Guy is watching television.
STEVEN: The Cable Guy holds up one finger as if to say "quiet." His eyes never leave the TV.
CABLE GUY: hope they fry this bastard. Steven sees that the Cable Guy has completely redecorated the room in a fashion which makes the room impractical for anything other than watching television. The TV is now on the stairs blocking the entrance into the living room. All furniture faces the TV, making conversation What happened?
STEVEN: What happened?
CABLE GUY: The arrangement of your major appliances and your furniture was causing some noisy pics and hum bars in your reception. I moved a few things. Cleared it right up. Is that cool?
STEVEN: I guess so.
CABLE GUY: ( off of Steven's look ) Then let me slave your remotes. He picks up Steven's remotes, punches in a complicated series of commands, then points them at each other. As he holds them together he makes a face as if their power is surging through him.
CABLE GUY: for everything?
STEVEN: for everything?
CABLE GUY: could be a cable guy yourself. ( he finishes ) Now let me check your levels. With amazing alacrity he adjusts color setting, sound controls, closed captioned, etc. Then he clicks through the channels. A music video, documentary on Hitler, Oprah Winfrey Show, starving kids, Barney, court TV. The Cable Guy watches emotionless.
CABLE GUY: have some paperwork for you to fill out. Sign here. Steven does.
CABLE GUY: ( beat ) Steven laughs. The Cable Guy joins him, but then continues to laugh way too hard for way too long. As the laugh ends it quickly turns into an awkward moment. The Cable Guy does not want to leave.
CABLE GUY: ( beat ) Okay. I feel good about this. Cable Guy walks to the door.
STEVEN: CABLE GUY he gave his cable guy fifty bucks and he got free movie channels. Have you ever heard of anything like that?

STEVEN: schoolhouse should be very attractive to young, upwardly mobile home buyers. And most important, the structure is available in foreclosure. If we put down a cash bid, we're going to steal this There is a pause, then everyone applauds. Mr. Daniels walks over to Steven and puts a proud arm around him. They speak as the meeting breaks up.

17 OMITTED: 17A INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - SIX-THIRTY P.M. Steven is watching television. He looks lonely and depressed. He clicks around in a daze, never stopping for more than a second. He hears a horn honking outside.
CABLE GUY: ( waves ) Hey buddy!!! Come on down!!! Steven waves and then steps back from the window. He doesn't know what to do. He looks at the ON THE TV - The local news.

CABLE GUY: Guy's Mecca. It was very emotional.
CABLE GUY: my head. They turn a corner and the satellite dish is right in front of them. It is enormous. Next to it is a one-hundred and fifty foot antenna. Next to that is a small fenced-in shack where the satellite's controls are located.

CABLE GUY: Never met dad. But the old TV was always there for me.
STEVEN: but he might as well have been gone. My mom is a stewardess. She was always out of town.

STEVEN: A player passes to Steven. Rick is covering him. Steven drives to the basket and puts in a lay up.
RICK: Shit! My fault! My fault!
STEVEN: is no stopping me today. Play begins again. A player named JEFF takes the ball out, then passes to a heavy-set player who catches the ball, then drives to the basket. When he does he twists his ankle, dropping the ball. The ball rolls out of bounds into a dark corner of the gym. We follow it as it rolls on the ground until it hits a man's sneaker. A pair of hands pick up the ball. The camera tilts up the man's body. It is the Cable Guy. He is holding another ball. He starts dribbling the two balls in a circular pattern.
CABLE GUY: was just in the neighborhood. Thought I'd run the court for a couple of innings.
RICK: Great. We need another man.
STEVEN: Rick smiles in recognition.
CABLE GUY: installation, but I feel like I've known him my whole life. Steven can't believe this is happening.
RICK: Douglas, you're on shirts. Let's play.

The dichotomy between his nerdy face, and his awesome physique is CABLE GUY The Cable Guy starts running wind sprints across the court, touching all the main lines.

CABLE GUY: And one! That's definitely a foul! ( to Jeff ) You want to mug me, my wallet is in my other pants.
STEVEN: What are you doing?
CABLE GUY: these guys.
CABLE GUY: Steven is so un-nerved by the Cable Guy's behavior that he misses a simple lay up. Steven grabs his own rebound. When he puts up a second shot, Rick gently fouls him. Steven stumbles to the ground. The ball does not go in.
CABLE GUY: He pulls Steven up.
STEVEN: CABLE GUY The cable Guy gets in Rick's face and gives him a death stare. Steven takes out the ball. He passes to a teammate who passes it to the Cable Guy who drives to the basket, then literally steps on Rick's back and leaps into the air and dunks the ball.

HOST: let me hear your voices! The crowd cheers. Music plays. The serfs hand them each a sword and shield, then walk them to the center of the pit. The Cable Guy crouches in a war-like position. He begins to circle Steven like a cat. Steven mirrors him, not sure of what to do.
STEVEN: The Cable Guy runs at Steven, and swings his sword. In fear, Steven puts his shield over his head. The sword smashes into it sending sparks into the air. The Cable Guy darts toward Steven and pokes him several times with his sword. Each time Steven blocks it with either his sword or his What are you doing?!
STEVEN: What are you doing?!

CABLE GUY: Steven charges at the Cable Guy, swinging wildly. It is a real battle now. He bangs away at the Cable Guy's mace until he knocks it out of his hands. The Cable Guy runs backwards, then falls on the ground. By the look in his eyes we can tell that the Cable Guy's feelings are hurt.
CABLE GUY: right. If you want to play rought, Daddy can play rough. The Cable Guy charges at Steven with his shield. He upper cuts the shield to Steven's face, sending him to the ground. The Cable Guy runs to the wall and grabs a huge battle ax, a four foot long stick with a fancy silver blade on the end of it. He swings it in circles like a Japanese master.

They continue to swing and roll in a vicious battle. Then the Cable Guy takes a swing which Steven is unable to block. The battle ax cuts through part of Steven's protection.

The Cable Guy flies through the air, lands on his back. Steven rides to him. Jumps off his horse, throws off his helmet.
