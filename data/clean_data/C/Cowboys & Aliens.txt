WES CLAIBORNE: ( NO RESPONSE )
LUKE CLAIBORNE: Maybe he's a dummy. Wes hops off his horse, right in The Man's face now
WES CLAIBORNE: There a reason you don't wanna answer my question, friend? And now, Mose nods to the BRACELET on The Man's wrist
MOSE CLAIBORNE: Wes, he's got iron on his wrist. and he's been shot.
LUKE CLAIBORNE: Bet he's a chain jumper. Luke spurs his horse behind him The Man's SURROUNDED.
LUKE: If he escaped, there'll be a bounty. Let's bring him with us. Wes nods as he slides a SAWED-OFF DOUBLE-BARREL from his back scabbard. COCKS both barrels. The dog GROWLS
WES CLAIBORNE: Not your lucky day, Stranger turn round and start walking. But The Man doesn't move. The Claibornes share glances. Wes steps forward RAISING HIS RIFLE
WALK OR: THE MAN MOVES, A MECHANISM OF BRUTAL VIOLENCE YANKS the rifle forward as BLAMI shot goes WILD suddenly the gun's in THE MAN'S HANDS BLAXI Wes is BLOWN backwards, HOLE IN HIS CHEST! As Hose draws his Enfield, The Man FLIPS the rifle again SLAM! MOSE FLIES OFF HIS SADDLE as The Man rolls UNDER Luke's horse GRABBING Luke's ankle suddenly Luke's FLAT on his back BREATHLESS, staring UP at the double-barrel:
LUKE CLAIBORNE: P-please, God d-don't The Man PULLS the trigger but CLICK! The rifle's EMPTY. Luke's RELIEF is short as The Man SLAMS the gun-butt down, knocking him out cold. And ALL of this took about ten seconds. This man is a cold-blooded KILLER. But somehow. he didn't seem to KNOW that. CONFUSION. Drops the rifle, looks down at his hands. covered in BLOOD. And the BODIES in his wake. The WIND loosens a piece of PAPER from Wes's jacket. It DANCES on the breeze flattens against The Stranger's foot. He picks it up, BLOODY FINGERPRINTS on what we now see is a TELEGRAM
MEACHAM: Palms to heaven, Friend. The Man freezes. Turns up his hands.
MEACHAM: Only two kinds of men get shot criminals and victims. ( steps forward; hard ) Which one're you?
MEACHAM: Got a name, son?
MEACHAM: What do you know?
MEACHAM: Odd wound. Looks. cauterized. ( off The Man's look ) Means somethin' burned it half closed. The Man just stares. News to him. And now, as Meacham leans over the wound, the METAL CROSS around his neck begins to twitch. lifting ever so SLIGHTLX off his chest towards the strange BRACELET on the Man's wrist. Meacham reacts
MEACHAM: Seems I remember a story about that happening once. fella by the name of How 'bout I just call you "Luke," for But TheMan's distracted by his REFLECTION in a cracked mirror: his own face unfamiliar. Meacham nods towards The Man's HANDS
MEACHAM: ( A BEAT )
MEACHAM: Well. Too bad. Can't absolve you for your sins if you don't recall 'em. That bein' said. Meacham looks up, eyes twinkling. This is not a fire n' brimstone preacher. This is a guy who GETS IT
MEACHAM: ( BEAT; GRINS )
PERCY: THIS IS A MESSAGE FROM MY FATHER! ONLY CLAIM TO LAND AROUND HERE'S THE ONE WITH HiS NAME ON IT! The gang rides down Main Street, HOOTING Percy cocks another Molotov, aiming for the SALOON But one of his men, half-Apache NAT COLORADO, shouts:
NAT COLORADO: Percy! N2t the saloon!
PERCY: Why the goddamn hell not?!
NAT COLORADO: Cause your dady said so. Something LOADED in the way he emphasizes "daddy." Percy GLARES strange RESENTMENT between them. With a growl, Percy GALLOPS OFF, chucks the flaming bottle onto the CHURCH STEPS:
MEACHAM: You wanna help or are you just gonna stand there and burn?!
MEACHAM: All right, folks don't panic! Get inside and you'll be fine. C'mon. Meacham tosses The Man one of the blankets, nods across the street to the GENERAL STORE which is just STARTING to burn
KID: Just tryin' to save the candy. ( SWALLOWS, worried now ) You one of my Pa's hired guns? Before he can answer, HOOFBEATS behind them and here's PERCY. He yanks the reins, pulls his REVOLVER on our Man
PERCY: Who the hell're yam? Whatever the opposite of Love At First Sight is, THIS is it:
THE MAN: Nobody is right. You think you can just collect your fifty dollars and ride off? You signed up for the wrong side, boy. The kid's scared. The Man ISN'T, despite the gun in his face:
PERCY: Nobody is right. You think you can just collect your fifty dollars and ride off? You signed up for the wrong side, boy. The kid's scared. The Man ISN'T, despite the gun in his face:
THE MAN: You want me to kiss your boot? Percy extends his boot just INCHES from The Man's face:
PERCY: Tongue's just fine if you're feelin' amorous. Don't hold ba THWIP! The Man YANKS Percy's boot off his foot in one quick move and KWHAM!!!1 WINGS IT RIGHT INTO PERCY'S FACE! Percy FLIES off the HORSE The Man grabbing his rifle the moment Percy lands, it's STICKING into his NECK:
THE MAN: Kiss this, you sonofa
PERCY: Goddamnit, Nat SHOOT HIM!!! but The Man yanks Percy up by his collar, using him as a SHIELD between himself and Colorado. Eerily calm
THE MAN: Wherever you came from? Go back. Colorado knows he's dealing with a PROFESSIONAL. MORE GANG MEMBERS ride up, surprised a dirty outlaw, GREAVEY, barks:
GREAVEY: Sheriff's right behind us, Nat!
PERCY: You goddamned shitheels! Don't you even THINK about leavin' me!!!! Colorado DECISION doesn't take long glares at The Man
NAT COLORADO: Be seeing you.
THE MAN: Look forward to it. With that, Nat spurs his horse YA! The others follow him as he RIDES HARD out of town. Percy growls at The Man
PERCY: You are a dead man. You hear me? So help me God I will kill you my DM! The Man's SMASHES Percy's skull with the gun, knocking him OUT COLD, as LAWMEN approach on horseback
KID: FA! He caught Percy Dolarhyde! SHERIFF KYLE TAGGART rears up on his horse. Tall, dark and handsome despite a SADNESS in his eyes, already dismounting:
SHERIFF TAGGART: Emmett you all right? The Kid ( now EMMETT ) strides towards his father excitedly:
EMMETT: YOU-SHOULDA-SEEN-IT-HE-TOSSED-PERCY-L IKE-
SHERIFF TAGGART: Pardon my boy, mister. He can be ( puts out his hand ) Kyle Taggart. The Man shakes Taggart's hand. A beat. Then
SHERIFF TAGGART: Well I'm in your debt, Luke. Tune of fifty dollars, actually. ( off The Man's look ) Our advert? The telegram? The Man NODS Oh, RIGHT.
SHERIFF TAGGART: Fair enough. You don't mind spending the night, bank opens in the morning. I'll get you your money then. ( nods down the street ) Saloon's got rooms. You just tell Maria I sent you. The Man tips his hat, nods to Emmett ( still STARSTRUCK ), turns to go. Taggart furrows his brow as the DOG scampers after him.
SHERIFF TAGGART: Yup. Real looker. Came into town yesterday with that there dog. She a friend of yours?
DEPUTY WADE: Somethin' wrong, Kyle?
SHERIFF TAGGART: What's that French sayin' where you swear you seen someone before?
DEPUTY WADE: Don't speak French.
SHERIFF TAGGART: No. you sure's hell don't. Taggart takes one last look at The Man departing as we CUT TO:
ROY CLANTON: I don't give a damn what he don't like gotta sit here and babysit a damn herd of cattle. Dolarhyde ain't gonna do squat. ( rises; grabs his
CROTCH ): Gotta see a man about a buffalo. He lets out a big BURP and stumbles off behind a ridge. More THUNDER. Something doesn't feel right. A sudden WHOOSH and
SWEET JESUS!!!: THE DARKNESS EXPLODES WITH EERILY BRILLIANT BLUE LIGHT! THE MEN SCREAM AS THEY'RE ENGULFED IN IT AND ROY CLANTON comes RUNNING back up the hill, pulling up his pants as the light DISAPPEARS to find the men GONE. So are the COWS. PULL BACK. he's ALL THAT'S LEFT in the open range.
DOC: I know you are, don't lie to me!
MARIA: How many times do we have to do this, Arturo? J. love you.
DOC: Really? Do you?!? ( holds up a POCKETWATCH ) I found this in our bed! And I don't k3 Vg. a watch, Maria. I can't AfjQrd a watch because y insisted we buy this She looks at him SQUARELY yes, some SECRET withheld. As The Man In Black reaches the bar, he's Maria's EXCUSE to end this:
MARIA: We have customers. And MOVES off. Doc stomps toward the exit sees EMMETT at the back of the bar stealing sips of BEER from left-behind glasses:
DOC: AFUERA! ADULTS ONLY!!! Emmett RUNS OUT. The Man sits beside an old cuss named ATTICUS. The dog heels at The Man's feet, eyes a STEAK on Atticus' plate:
ATTICUS: That mutt makes a move for my steak, I'll drill him down.
MARIA: Shut up, Atticus. This is the man who took out Percy Dolarhyde. Atticus grumbles and goes back to eating, but not before sweeping his duster aside to show the GUN in his holster. Maria rolls her eyes, sets a GLASS in front of The Man, who nods:
MARIA: What kind?
MARIA: Never seen her before. But she is ( pours him whiskey; then one for herself ) Here's to you finding her, Senor. ON THE MAN. Not exactly sure he WANTS to. But they CLINK glasses, knock 'em back. Maria pours him another:
MARIA: It's not the boy you should worry about.
DOLARHYDE: Name's Woodrow Dolarhyde. I'm what you might call, the Tall Hog at the trough.
CLANTON: Mr. Dolarhyde, I. I swear I didn't
STEAL YOUR: a VIOLENT "SSST" from Dolarhyde JOSTLES the horses STRETCHING Roy tight enough to SNAP he SCREAMS
DOLARHYDE: Best not to interrupt me, Roy, makes the horses skittish.
ROY CLANTON: Mr. Dolarhyde, Sir, you gotta believe me I went to take a piss and and saw a light in the sky blue and when I ran back the cows and fellas were gone!
DOLARHYDE: The sky. Opened up. And took my cows. Incoming HOOFBEATS Dolarhyde looks up to see COLORADO and the rest of the GANG returning from Absolution. A WOMAN emerges from the servant's quarters. APACHE. 50's. Beautiful. As the men REAR, Nat Colorado MEETS EYES with her. A relationship we don't understand yet as Dolar strides up
NAT COLORADO: Jail. Sheriff locked him up. Dolar darkens. Unsheathes a KNIFE. Looks down at Roy:
DOLARHYDE: When're these people gonna lgarn? He STABS the knife down. SLICING the rope tethered to Roy's FEET. His lower body SLUMPS to the ground, he breathes a SIGH:
ROY CLANTON: THANK Y
THANK Y: Dolar SLAPS the horse's rump, to which Roy's UPPER TORSO is tied; it GALLOPS off, dragging a SCREAMING ROY into the night.
DOLARHYDE: Everyone saddle up. Got us a sheriff to As he MOVES OFF, Dolarhyde's eyes go to the Apache Woman. Something passes between them. She seems CONCERNED.
NAT COLORADO: Wasn't the sheriff, got him caught. It was a stranger. That STOPS Dolarhyde. He turns back, face dark:
DOLARHYDE: . What stranger?
NAT COLORADO: Usually a man gives off a scent. Where he's been. What he's done.
SHERIFF TAGGART: Tomorrow we ride the little shit up Phoenix way, turn him over. Dolarhyde's got a beef, he can take it up with the 6th cavalry. Taggart's on his feet, grabs his JACKET off the door
MARIA: You drink like a man who wants to forget.
ATTICUS: You got three seconds to get your dog outta here or I blow his balls off.
ATTICUS: Q=. two. and just before "three". CA-CLICK. Atticus FREEZES, because there's a RIFLE BARREL at the back of h,iS head now:
ATTICUS: I was just havin' some fun, Miss
ELLA: Give- him, the steak. Atticus HESITATES, angry at the humiliation. Ella PRESSES THE GUN HARDER against his neck, lowering him and his plate to the floor. Right in front of the dog, who GROWLS
ATTICUS: ( biting his tongue ) I'm sorry.
ELLA: His name's 'Happy.' HappyBARES HIS TEETH. INCHES from Atticus' face
ATTICUS: I'm sorry. 'Happy.'
ELLA: Alright then. ( lowers her rifle ) You're right. That was fun.
ELLA: The hell're you talking ab? WRIST BRACELET. Surprise and REVELATION:
SHERIFF TAGGART: Hey there, "Luke." Mind following me down to the office so we can have us a THE MAN IN BLACK What for?
SHERIFF TAGGART: All due respect, I'm the law, mister. That's what for. The men LOCK EYES:
SHERIFF TAGGART: Because we did meet. ON ELLA. For reasons we're not sure of, the idea of The Man leaving ALARMS her. All the Gunslingers' hands are POISED by holsters. The Man stays preternaturally COOL:
SHERIFF TAGGART: And what's gonna happen?
SHERIFF TAGGART: Now why'd you have to go and say that? Taggart gives a nod and the men start to CONVERGE
SHERIFF TAGGART: Yup looks just like him.
PERCY: You're a dead. Jake sits up. Woozy. Blinking back to reality.
JAKE: Shut up. Jake sits back on his cot, rubbing his still-throbbing head.
ELLA: I need to see Lonergan. It's important.
DEPUTY WADE: 'Fraid not, Miss we're preppin' him for transport. And pushes PAST her, into the office with the men. HOLD on Ella dammit, she NEEDS to find a way in there.
SHERIFF TAGGART: What happened to him?
JAKE: ( DEADPAN )
SHERIFF TAGGART: Step back against the wall there. Move and I shoot you dead.
JAKE: ( as he does ) You should've let me go.
SHERIFF TAGGART: Yeah, I should've shot you in your knee. You put down six of my deputies.
JAKE: Six was all you had.
SHERIFF TAGGART: Hell, they're gonna love you in Phoenix.
JAKE: Yeah? What's in Phoenix?
SHERIFF TAGGART: What you got comin', Jake Lonergan. Taggart reaches into his shirt, pulls out a pair of GLASSES. Slips them on his nose. Takes out that WANTED poster and reads:
JAKE: ( after a long BEAT: ) That it?
SHERIFF TAGGART: Saved the best for last. 'Murder.' That LANDS on Jake. Wondering if this is TRUE. Evenly
JAKE: It say who I killed?
SHERIFF TAGGART: Prostitute outta Mojave, name of Alice Taggart rises, removes Jake's BLACK STETSON from a hook on the wall, pulls that PHOTOGRAPH OF THE WOMAN from the inner brim:
GREAVEY: blue light. Clanton said he saw blue light before the cows disappeared.
DOLARHYDE: Just a storm.
COLORADO: No storm I've ever seen. I say we wait 'til it passes. But Dolar isn't listening. THROUGH HIS BINOCULARS: he sees PERCY being carried into the prison wagon. Followed by Jake.
DOLARHYDE: No time, they put him in an iron coach. With a HYA! he's OFF, the others FOLLOWING with reluctant looks still SPOOKED by that incoming STORM:
DEPUTY WADE: Gimme your wrist. Jake holds out his hands. Wade unlocks one wrist, freeing a cuff. then takes that cuff and LOCKS IT to Percy's wrist.
JAKE: What're you ?
CHARLIE: Best way to make a man stay put: chain him to his enemy.
EMMETT: You sure he's a bad guy, Pa? He did give Percy a lickin'.
SHERIFF TAGGART: He's bad enough.
EMMETT: ( not so sure, but ) . can I come with you?
SHERIFF TAGGART: Too dangerous.
EMMETT: Dangerous to drive a damn coach? Why can't Charlie just take him?
SHERIFF TAGGART: Because it's my job, Emmett. That's what these people pay me to do. And your mother would kill me if I brought you. Emmett looks off, half sad, half angry
EMMETT: Good thing she's already dead then. And turns without a goodbye. Taggart watches him leave, wishing he could connect. Takes the reins and looks up REACTS: THAT MASSIVE. FRIGHTENING CLOUD IN THE SKY roiling faster toward town. The scary BLUE FLASHES within grow more INTENSE. IN THE COACH WITH JAKE, looking at the BRACELET, the pulsing growing MORE FREQUENT and then, a VOICE:
HEY!: Jake turns to see ELLA, pushed up against the coach window:
JAKE: Maybe you should'a asked before you knocked me out..
ELLA: Please. I need to know. Just tell me where you got it.
JAKE: Y dOli' .xBmbgX - - I don' t remember my name or where I've been or any of the things they said I done, so leave me the hell alone. And sits back as the coach starts to MOVE, leaving Ella in the dust. Some of the gunmen ride atop it; others on horseback cover the coach in a protective ring. Wade sees something incoming from the NORTH:
DEPUTY WADE: Taggart looks up: Dolarhyde's gang racing down the mountain
KYLE!!!: Taggart looks up: Dolarhyde's gang racing down the mountain
SHERIFF TAGGART: He unslings his SHOTGUN as his men ready their weapons ON DOLARHYDE'S GANG, riding hard, guns ready too This is about to get UGLY. BUT. from the OTHER end of town, the WIND picks up As the massive storm cloud seems shockingly to have STORED AT A H its EYE churning, ROARING and. TWO BOLTS OF BLUE LIGHTNING CRACK DOWN FROM IT! Happy starts BARKING MADLY. Ella sees the lightning and starts to BACK AWAY in fear:
DAMNIT: He unslings his SHOTGUN as his men ready their weapons ON DOLARHYDE'S GANG, riding hard, guns ready too This is about to get UGLY.

SHERIFF TAGGART: EMMETT ! Emmett runs into his dad's embrace
EMMETT !: Emmett runs into his dad's embrace
EMMETT: a STEEL CABLE fires from the collar, SNAPS TAUT as it connects to a speeder and WHOOSH! Taggart's RIPPED off his feet, dragged away ELLA tackles the boy as ANOTHER RING zooms overhead, locks around a FLEEING WOMAN she's TAKEN
PA!!: a STEEL CABLE fires from the collar, SNAPS TAUT as it connects to a speeder and WHOOSH! Taggart's RIPPED off his feet, dragged away ELLA tackles the boy as ANOTHER RING zooms overhead, locks around a FLEEING WOMAN she's TAKEN

JAKE: HEY!! LET US OUT!!! AWAY! Percy STRUGGLES wildly against Jake in a TUG-O'-WAR:
PERCY JAKE: THE HELL FOR ?! I CAN GET US FREE! GIMME YOUR DAMN HAND!!! Percy RELENTS. Offers up his hand. Jake grabs all of Percy's
DOLARHYDE: Nat Colorado RACES IN as Dolar draws his .45 BANG! shatters the coach lock they PULL Percy out:
PERCY: MY FINGERS!! HZ BE= MY FINGERS!!! QUIT WHININ' AND FIND A HORSE! As Dolar runs for his horse, Percy sees a PISTOL left on the ground grabs it with his good hand and FIRES at Jake who JUKES behind the coach for cover, Percy SHOOTING in a FURY but: KLINK! A collar CLAMPS around Percy's neck and he's YANKED OFF TOO! Dolarhyde turns and SEES HIS SON DISAPPEAR:
DOLARHYDE: QUIT WHININ' AND FIND A HORSE! As Dolar runs for his horse, Percy sees a PISTOL left on the ground grabs it with his good hand and FIRES at Jake who JUKES behind the coach for cover, Percy SHOOTING in a FURY but: KLINK! A collar CLAMPS around Percy's neck and he's YANKED OFF TOO! Dolarhyde turns and SEES HIS SON DISAPPEAR:
MARIA: Doc LEAPS after her but her collar's LASSO CABLE whips out, TETHERING to a passing Speeder and she's RIPPED OUT THE DOOR
AYUDAMEEEEEEE!: Doc LEAPS after her but her collar's LASSO CABLE whips out, TETHERING to a passing Speeder and she's RIPPED OUT THE DOOR
DOC: EXT. BIRDCAGE THEATER - CELLAR - CONTINUOUS ELLA hurrying Emmett toward the theater's CELLAR DOOR, but a SPEEDER circles around and ROARS toward them ON JAKE. He SEES this and suddenly, to HIS surprise as much as OURS. HIS BRACELET ACTIVATES! METAL COMING TO LIFE, coiling up around his arm WHAT? HOW? as it becomes.
MARIA!!!: EXT. BIRDCAGE THEATER - CELLAR - CONTINUOUS ELLA hurrying Emmett toward the theater's CELLAR DOOR, but a SPEEDER circles around and ROARS toward them ON JAKE. He SEES this and suddenly, to HIS surprise as much as OURS. HIS BRACELET ACTIVATES! METAL COMING TO LIFE, coiling up around his arm WHAT? HOW? as it becomes.
ELLA: Everyone inside! GO GO GO!! Ushering Emmett and TOWNSFOLK underground, PULLS the door SHUT
DOC: Maria oh God they t-took her What MOANS, WAILS. desperate cries as people search for loved ones. JAKE'S BLASTER RETRACTS, folding in on itself shrinks down to size, reverting back into a BRACELET. He's stunned. So are the remaining townsfolk. DOLARHYDE is first to speak:
DOLARHYDE: Who the hell're ?
NAT COLORADO: He's the one who caged Percy. Dolarhyde starts MOVING toward Jake wild killer eyes
DOLARHYDE: why're you asking m Dolarhyde GRIPS Jake's arm THE BRACELET:
JAKE: why're you asking m Dolarhyde GRIPS Jake's arm THE BRACELET:
DOLARHYDE: This! Where'd you get this?! It was shooting the same light beams they were
JAKE: Let go of my wrist.
DOLARHYDE: I'm not lettin' go of nothin' til you tell me what the he KA-LLLANG!! Suddenly that CHURCH BELL comes HURTLING out of the church wreckage, PLOWS through debris. People scatter. And out of the church stumbles. AN ALIEN. 8 FT. TALL. Standing upright, limbs inverted limbs that DRAG, wounded, as people SCREAM and RUN and Jake and Dolarhyde can only stare, jaws dropped, and the monster LUNGES: WHUPWHUP something SPINNING through the air A HATCHET -
EMMETT: Is it. dead? Jake KICKS the alien. It doesn't move. Happy BARKS
DOLARHYDE: . The hell j,,a it?
EMMETT: Lookit its wrist! It's got one'a those bracelet things too! Indeed, there on the creature's wrist is an IDENTICAL BRACELET. ON JAKE. Mind tumbling. He meets eyes with ELLA. Her face as EAGER as his to understand this and now. BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. What's that SOUND? Everyone looks at each other. Colorado bends closer to the corpse. SCARED.
NAT COLORADO: I think. it's comin' from somewhere inside it. People look at each other: WHAT NOW? Trying to control the near- hysteria they all feel. Finally, Dolarhyde takes a BREATH more BRAVADO than actual courage:
DOLARHYDE: Only one way to find out. We need to cut it open.
DOC: . Are you. serious? ( looks to them all )
DOLARHYDE: Wake u Those things took your wife
DOC: I KNOW THAT!! Well this one here's our only chance of findin' where they went. That LANDS on all of them. A long beat. Doc looks down at the thing, ORANGE GOO dribbling around the AXE in its head.
DOLARHYDE: Well this one here's our only chance of findin' where they went. That LANDS on all of them. A long beat. Doc looks down at the thing, ORANGE GOO dribbling around the AXE in its head.
DOLLARHYDE: So you got a bone saw or don't you?
DOC: Stay outside. You're not welcome in Dolar brings up his COLT so does COLORADO
DOLARRYDE: I own more of this town than any man in it so I'll go wherever the hell I damn please. And for the record? You ain't welcome in my country, Mexican. Ella steps between them, BAD ASS
ELLA: Whatever troubles you had don't mean a damn thing against the ones we got now. We wanna see our way through 'em, your guns better start pointing in the same direction, Goddammit. Doc and Dolar never take eyes off each other. or their GUNS. Finally. Dolar LOWERS his. So does Doc. People BREATHE. Meacham slips on a pair of GLASSES, studying eerie veins and muscles through the creature's viscous outer layers. Doc turns his focus to the alien too. Picks up his PUMP-OPERATED BONE SAW. Presses his boot on the bellows, it turns with a WHIR. SHAKING as he brings the SPINNING BLADE to the alien's CHEST. Looks at Meacham, AFRAID
DOC: If it 'mss a demon, and I cut it open. am I going to burn for it?
MEACHAM: That should cover ya. ON DOC. Little relief. BROW SWEATING, he brings the spinning blade down toward the disgusting ALIEN VRRRRZZ HESITATES
DOC: Excuse me. B GH! He PUKES on the ground.
EMMETT: Jesus, Doc!!! Doc wipes his mouth with a handkerchief, slightly DEFIANT
DOC: This is not normal. I'm entitled to vomit. We should XU be vomiting.
DOLARHYDE: Just cut, Lardass. Doc GLARES. with a still-shakitig hand, gets back to business
DOC: Senor? A hand?
EMMETT: Damn! Smells like a dead dog's ass.
MEACHAM: Sorry, Father. Doc covers his face with his handkerchief as he explores.
EMMETT: Sorry, Father. Doc covers his face with his handkerchief as he explores.
DOC: Chet wall's partially collapsed. no familiar organs of any kind.
DOLARHYDE: 'course they're not familiar. Just look at this th
DOC: Spinal reflex. And GRINS at Dolar's pain. But Meacham NOTICES something around Dolar's neck where the alien pinned him, like a ring of DUST:
MEACHAM: Something on your neck. Hold still. Meacham sweeps a little off Dolar's neck, rubs it between thumb and forefinger. The dust GLINTS under the kerosene lamp:
NAT COLORADO: Down here too. ( looks to Dolar ) This much ore. could only have come from a digging in a mine. That LANDS on everyone. but most especially ELLA. Who looks up to see Jake READING her in this moment.
EMMETT: In the ALIEN'S EYE is a SMALL FLASHING LIGHT. On/Off/On/Off in time with that BEEP BEEP BEEP.
DOC: Gimme my scalpel. In MACRO CU, DOC CUTS INTO THE EYE, WET SQUISHY SOUNDS as he pulls it from its socket, attached to a STRINGY OPTIC NERVE dripping with juice. Clamped to the nerve is a METALLIC ORB: he takes hold of the blinking orb. It FLARES to life, the light coalescing into a 3-D ARROW-LIKE HOLOGRAM. Confusion. Doc REMOVES it from the optic nerve and the hologram DISAPPEARS:
DOLARHYDE: Where'd it go? The hell'd you do?
DOC: Nothing, just pulled it off He reconnects it to the optic nerve, the hologram REAPPEARS:
NAT COLORADO: I think. it's a compass. Look: ( fiddles with tweezers ) No matter how you move it, it points in the same direction.
EMMETT: Compasses point north. That's west.
MEACHAM: ( realizing; to Jake ) West's where 141 came from. ON JAKE. Another puzzle piece falling into place.
EMMETT: If you're right, what's it pointing to?
ELLA: The rest of 'em.
DOLARHYDE: Then that's where I'm goin'. He SNAPS his PISTOL open, loading bullets:
MEACHAM: Your b was taken too. A FLASH of something from Dolarhyde could that be EMOTION? But just as fast, it's GONE. Almost a THROWAWAY:
DOLARHYDE: I noticed.
NAT COLORADO: What if they're already dead?
EMMETT: They're not dead.
ELLA: Kid's right. If all they wanted was to kill us, they would've.
DOLARHYDE: Looked to me like. they were ropin' Means they need 'em for something. Whatever it is, we can either stand here guessin'. or go find out. His eyes flash to Nat: "C'mon." And they EXIT. Everyone looks at each other, working up the courage to face what they know they must. Doc grabs his SHOTGUN, starts gathering shells:
DOC: If she's alive if there's even a
CHANCE: Lord hates a coward. but our bullets were useless against those things. Other than his wrist gizmo, we're outgunned and As one by one, they turn. to JAKE. Who until this point has been mostly SILENT. Observing. But now he's gone from enemy to potential savior in a heartbeat.
MEACHAM: Lord hates a coward. but our bullets were useless against those things. Other than his wrist gizmo, we're outgunned and As one by one, they turn. to JAKE. Who until this point has been mostly SILENT. Observing. But now he's gone from enemy to potential savior in a heartbeat.
JAKE: Whoa, I got nothing to do with this
ELLA: You got everything to do with it. If you can remember where you got that thing
JAKE: I remember you all wantin' me on the end of a damned rope. Whatever's happenin' here's got nothin' to do with me.
ELLA: You sure. about that? He LOOKS at her. No, he isn't. But he sure as hell won't stay to debate it turns to go
EMMETT: Mr. Lonergan? Sir? The EMOTION in the boy's voice STOPS Jake at the door.
JAKE: Kid, I'm the last man you want anywhere near you, your Pa. or anyone else in this goddamned town. OUT the door. Everyone trades looks, then Ella FOLLOWS:
ELLA: That's it? You're just gonna run away?
JAKE: No, Sister. I'm walking away.
ELLA: Well s w. As he keeps on walking, Ella picks up a ROCK, wings it at the back of his HEAD WHAMI Jake stumbles forward, TURNS AROUND
JAKE ELLA: SONOVA I told you to gyp. Ella strides forward, picking up another rock on the move
JAKE: What's your damn problem?!
ELLA: You're comin' with us.
JAKE: I'm not coming anywhere. And you throw that rock I swear I'll WHAM! The rock glances off his shoulder
ELLA: If you're walkin' away from here, what the hell're you walking tsQ? That PENETRATES as Jake realizes he doesn't really KNOW. And that's the last thing he's gonna admit
JAKE: What the hell are you walkin' to, Lady? 'Cause if I heard right, it sounds like suicide to me. now it's her turn to pause. Cryptically:
ELLA: I. just wanna help these people.
JAKE: Bullshit. You wanna help yourself. Saw your face light up the minute you knew that thing might lead you to gold. And the fact that he's BUSTED her gets Ella's hackles up
ELLA: It's not gold I want, you dumb sonofabitch, it's what it'll buy me.
JAKE: And what's that?
ELLA: Whatever that means, it's a deep, painful LONGING in her. She stares at him, DEAD ON:
DOLARHYDE: Somebody got something to say? His withering GLARE keeps them from speaking up. Doc and Meacham climb onto the wagon:
MEACHAM: ( THE ALIEN )
DOC: If this arrow points me back to Maria? Yeah J'm sure. Emmett appears leading a PONY, a BOW and quiver of ARROWS slung around his back:
MEACHAM: Can't come, Emmett, too dangerous.
EMMETT: I can protect myself shoot, I'm the only master bowman in my archery club. Won the county tournament by shootin' a flipped nickel at 50 paces.
MEACHAM: Somethin' tells me these things don't carry nickels, son. Answers's no.
EMMETT: You want me to ride off with the chickenshits, then double back, be happy to. But let's just skip that part and get to it, Padre. And that's the truth. Meacham sighs, no choice. finally:
MEACHAM: Go fill your canteen, dammit. He SLAPS the reins and the wagon rides off. Emmett GRINS and mounts the pony, then sees. JAKE riding past. ANGRY EYES from Ella as she heels her horse and TROTS OFF angrily:
ELLA: C'mon, Happy. But HAPPY remains, torn between them, tail wagging and looking up at Jake as if to say: PLEASE COME?
JAKE: Oh shut up. Suppressing GUILT, he rides on toward the hills as Dolarhyde VEERS his horse in front of Jake, cutting him off:
DOLARHYDE: I was ridin' into town to kill you for what you done to my son. You owe me your life, Boy.
JAKE: You that fast?
DOLARHYDE: FAST ENOU
FAST ENOU: WHOOSH: Jake's hand is already UP with his own PISTOL, having drawn before Dolarhyde can finish his sentence:
JAKE: Now you owe me y.Q= life. We're square. In a DAZZLING TWIRL, Jake slaps it back in his holster. Point made, he RIDES ON. Dolarhyde, burning mad at having been out- drawn, turns to CULOBAI )U speaks LOW:
DOLARHYDE: Follow him. Soon as he's got his back turned. kill him.
MEACHAM: Figure out which way you're headed yet?
JAKE: West. Saguaro Pass.
MEACHAM: That's not what I meant. The inference LANDS on Jake. But he's in no mood. GALLOPS off. Meacham watches Jake go. MUSIC RISES AS WE DISSOLVE THROUGH:
THE WOMAN: You shouldn't have. She turns, drops the flowers into the vase as we see she's talking to JAKE.
JAKE: Got you somethin' else.
THE WOMAN: Where'd you get this?
JAKE: Where do you think? The woman looks to the pouch Picks up one of the coins. TORN. Jake moves behind her. Close. An INTIMACY here.
THE WOMAN: Your boys '11 come after you. ON JAKE. Dark. But DETERMINED:
JAKE: Let 'em come. She turns to him, their eyes HOLD. and they KISS. Soft. Tender. Soulful. But then a THUNDERCRACK turns their attention to the window: A STORM CLOUD on the horizon. Same kind that consumed the town. The cabin starts to VIBRATE like a tuning fork. The pouch slides off the table. THE GOLD COINS SPILL OUT and
THE WOMAN: What's happening?!!!
BLASTER: JAKE DIVES AWAY but a searing pulse RIPS A WICKED GASH in his side ( now we know how he woke up with it in the desert )
JAKE: As he RUSHES to her, her collar UNLOCKS. and FLIES AT JAKE, clamping HE'S PULLED INTO THE LIGHT, CHOKING, SCREAMING
GREAVEY: So. what's a pretty lady like y
ELLA: you finish that sentence, I shoot you in your beef whistle. Doc, sipping from his canteen, does a SPIT TAKE. Ella's eyes DRILL Greavey. Cut down a peg, he tips his hat, red-faced:
GREAVEY: And rides past her, taking us to EMMETT and DOLARHYDE:
DOLARHYDE: Tell me somethin', Kid. why didn't your father just take my money?
EMMETT: ( CONFUSED )
UOLARHY DE: offered him a thousand dollars to leave town. He could's taken you outta harm's way, relocated. found you a new momma. And this just BURNS Emmett. A beat; then:
EMMETT: Is it true Percy's momma died givin' birth to him, Mister Dolarhyde? Something FLASHES in Dolarhyde. But he's contained:
DOLARHYDE: Then maybe you should use that thousand dollars to buy yourself a new wife. Emmett HOLDS his look against Dolarhyde's. Brave and UNFLINCHING. Doc can't help but grin at the kid's moxie. but it's short-lived as his face suddenly falls:
EMMETT: Then maybe you should use that thousand dollars to buy yourself a new wife. Emmett HOLDS his look against Dolarhyde's. Brave and UNFLINCHING. Doc can't help but grin at the kid's moxie. but it's short-lived as his face suddenly falls:
DOC: Madre Dios. And we PAN AROUND, dropping over his shoulder to see what he's reacting to AN ENORMOUS CRATER. ACRES WIDE. TWENTY FEET DEEP. Even Dolarhyde looks nervous now:
DOLARYHYDE: What the. hell is it?
MEACHAM: It was Winfield's Landing. They turn to see Meacham, brushing the DUST off a WOODEN SIGN: Holds it UP. " Winfield's Landing. Population 133." ON GREAVEY AND THE MEN. Shit. He doesn't mean.?
GREAVEY: You tryin' to tell me those. things pulled the whole damn town into the sky? And suddenly a weird CRACK shakes the canyon like the SOUND BARRIER BREAKING everyone's look goes UP where: SWIRLING, DARK CLOUDS LOOM. The same clouds that dropped the tornado on Absolution. And that appeared in Jake's MEMORIES at the cabin. But this time, something's SHOT OUT from them
MEACHAM: That can't be good. The plummeting object HITS a distant dune, kicking up a SAND
DOLARHYDE: everyone runs their horses aside as the object BOUNCES over rocks then SLOWS. to a STOP. They STARE. Finally Dolarhyde kicks his horse forward slowly. DISMOUNTS, draws his GUN. What he sees is SHOCKING: It's an OVAL CAPSULE OF BLUE GOO, the outer layer some kind of TRANSLUCENT COCOON. Suspended within the murky Jell-o is a GE, DEC SHAPE. Motionless. UH-OH. The others draw guns too, converging around it in equal SHOCK and FEAR. But the thing doesn't MOVE.
DOC: Should we. open it?
DOLARHYDE: Should we open it? Hell NO we shouldn
EMMETT: and now we find Emmett's already POKING it with a stick, a Small TEAR in the cocoon's outer embryonic layer GOO leaks then it RUPTURES, EXPLODING as the horses REAR away, WHINNYING the goo spreads across the desert floor, thinning out. BEAT. Everyone wipes blue shit off their clothes as they come FACE-TO-FACE with the object inside, lying there on the ground:
GREAVEY: Boss. it's one'a yours. Dolarhyde's eyes NARROW. Emmett looks at Doc, SCARED:
EMMETT: Is is this what happened to my Pa? Doc dismounts. Moves to the cow's mouth and PULLS OUT THAT TUBE with a wet SQUISHING sound. Thinking it through:
DOC: This was stuck down its throat. to help it breathe. That means they wanted to keep it alive, Emmett. ( forces a small smile ) I'm sure your father is fine. But Doc's eyes aren't sure. Meacham looks back to the sky:
MEACHAM: Why'd they dump it?
ELLA: Whatever they needed from it, they must've got.
EMMETT: Ho-ly shit. BOOM UP to reveal a SURREAL SIGHT in the valley below: AGAMBLING RIVERBOAT. Nose buried in the sand, paddlewheels facing the sky, as if it'd been dropped from the clouds into the desert. Just like that cow. Off their LOOKS
DOC: "Colorado Queen."
ELLA: Son of a bitch. IT'S JAKE ON HORSEBACK. Followed by another horse, with COLORADO in the saddle. Wrists tied but ALIVE. As Jake rides to a stop, he PUSHES Colorado off the horse the indian HITS the ground with a THUD as Jake levels Dolarhyde with HARD EYES:
JAKE: Your man got it in his head that he was s'posed to kill me. I'm holding onto his ear 'til he says sorry.
DOLARHYDE: Why'd you let him live? Jake's hard-as-nails. DRIVEN now
JAKE: Gonna need him. He rides past Dolar to Ella. Stops. Says, simply:
ELLA: That'd be me. He realizes her shirt's caked in the BLUE GOO from the cow.
JAKE: Why're you blue?
ELLA: ( DRYLY )
DOLARHYDE: We better keep movin'. A THUNDERCRACK. On the horizon, sheets of RAIN.
JAKE: Storm's comin'. I say we dig in here til it passes. ( to Colorado; fucking
DOLARHYDE: Storm or no storm, I say we keep movin'. Colorado finally turns to Uolarhyde. DEFIANT:
NAT COLORADO: Too hard tracking anything in the rain.
DOLARHYDE: You okay?
COLORADO: ( low, eyes averted ) Dolar pours some whiskey on a BANDANA, leans towards Colorado
DOLARHYDE COLORADO: Lemme clean it for you or it'll get I'm fine. Dolarhyde backs away. Colorado GLARES.
DOLARHYDE: Say it.
COLORADO: ( after a beat ) Is Percy worth dyin' for? Dolar's eyes flash. A mixture of anger and PAIN. Then
DOLARHYDE: He's my son.
DOC: ( re: the tin plates ) We brought enough water.
MEACHAM: Not for drinkin', it's for blessin'. Doc nods: ah. Turns to go. STOPS. Turns back. Intense eyes:
DOC: Padre. Maria came to see you in confession every Sunday. It seemed. she had a lot to talk about. ( beat, this is hard ) Was she having an affair? Meacham removes his spectacles. Looks at Doc
MEACHAM: You know I can't say. And Doc DOES know. But there's a quiet DESPERATION here
DOC: The last thing I said to her. I. ( shakes his head; then ) Please. If I'm wrong about my wife. I don't want to die angry. Meacham sees the PAIN in his friend's eyes.
MEACHAM: You can ask Maria if she was cheatin' on you once we get her back. 'Til then? ( bit of a grin ) Don't die.
JAKE: You missed a spot.
ELLA: The hell,-re- you doing here?
JAKE: Mindin' my own business. ( snaps out the match ) Then you decided to take a shower.
ELLA: Why didn't you say anything?
JAKE: Givin' you privacy. She throws her shirt on, but her skin's wet and the shirt glues to her, celebrating her shape in a way that can't be ignored. Jake tosses her his jacket. As she slips it on, she notices a bottle of WHISKEY on the table. and the PHOTOGRAPH OF ALICE.
ELLA: . she's pretty. ( Jake says NOTHING ) Who was she? Jake's quiet. DARK. Intense emotion, intensely suppressed:
JAKE: only thing I know's her name was Alice.
ELLA: Maybe you loved her. Jake shakes his head, sort of mumble/chuckles in RESISTANCE:
JAKE: All you women are the same Always wanna make it about Goddamn "love."
ELLA: ( A BEAT )
JAKE: Don't matter. She takes a step closer. Soft. Intimate.
ELLA: So what dj= matter? Jake just looks at her. Then, lifts the cheroot to his lips, the FLARE of its tip casting him in a demonic light.
JAKE: What matters is I find the thing that killed her. ( dark as hell ) And make it pay. And now, he leans forward with a focused LOOK. holds up his
ELLA: They took my people. Destroyed where I'm Where's that?
JAKE: Where's that?
ELLA: North of here. Been trackin' 'em ever since, town to town. Best I figure, they're hidin' in a mine. Jake CONSIDERS all this. Softens a little:
JAKE: Maybe if you'd told me the truth instead of throwin' rocks at me
ELLA: what, you would've stuck around? Bullshit. I couldn't've turned you away from what you had to do, any more than I could've stopped these people from going after their kin.
JAKE: So that's the only reason you wanted me to come with you? Cause of my gun? There's a pause. then Ella SMIRKS back:
ELLA: No, not your gun.
GREAVEY: What the hell're we doin' here? We should be ridin' in the opposite direction of those things
COBBETT: We do that, the old man's likely to shoot us himself. Only way outta this is And suddenly. Greavey SNIFFS the air, FROWNS:
GREAVEY: . what's that smell? as they TURN to the deck where the creature lays. ALL THEY
COBBETT: AW SH
AW SH: LIGHTNING FLASHES, illuminating the ship and als4THE ALIEN behind them. a coiled mass clinging spiderlike to the ceiling!!! Its arm WHIPS out, noosing around Cobbett LIFTS HIM off his feet SLAMS HIM into the ceiling TOSSES HIM like a ragdoll: The men SHOUT a PAIR OF RAZOR SHARP CANINES extrude from the alien then it SPRINGS SLICING THROUGH TWO MEN AT ONCE GREAVEY and 2 others manage to SCRAMBLE AWAY:
DOLARHYDE: Get behind me, Boy THE ALIEN SPRINGS INTO THE ROOM landing upside down on the ceiling. Dolar FIRES at it
GODDAMMITT!!!: And the fire's GROWING around the boat
JAKE: Don't know if you understand me. but you hurt that boy and I hurt you.
HELL, DEMON!: Meacham brings his CANTEEN down like a HATCHET, SPRAYING the alien with HOLY WATER. but NOTHING happens! And then The Alien STRIKES SLAMMING MEACHAM BACK INTO A JUTTING PIECE
JAKE: Easy, now. Don't move, dammit
MEACHAM: Go after the boy. then you get our people back.
JAKE: Stop talking. DQW! GET YOUR ASS But Meacham GRABS Jake, EYE TO EYE. GASPING:
MEACHAM: Listen up. 'cause I'm not gonna be able to say it again ( pulls Jake CLOSE ) God don't care who you were, Son. only who you Mg. ON JAKE. AFFECTED. With a last RASP, Meacham DIES just as DOC races through the growing FLAMES REACTS no time to mourn
DOC: JAKE WE GOTTA GO M! But Jake can't let go FURY HEARTBREAK Doc PULLS HIM away Jake SNAGS THE CRUCIFIX off Meacham's neck as he's forced OUT, leaving Meacham's body to be CONSUMED BY FLAMES
ELLA: RAIN'S GONNA COVER ITS TRACKS! That thing. was dead. it was d-ead. DOLARHYDE, RAIN pouring down his face. VULNERABLE and GUILTY:
NAT COLORADO: That thing. was dead. it was d-ead. DOLARHYDE, RAIN pouring down his face. VULNERABLE and GUILTY:
DOLARHYDE: I couldn't stop it It just. grabbed the kid. ON JAKE. Rage-filled against the flames. Meacham's CRUCIFIX in his hared, as his FIST closes around it. Looks up, HARDCORE:
JAKE: Then we'd better get him back.
EMMETT: Damn. You are one ugly bastar PSST! The alien spits a RESIN GOB on Emmett's mouth PSST PSST! More gobs PIN his limbs to the wall. Emmett can't move can't speak eyes WIDE and TERRIFIED The creature looks down at an ARMOR PLATE on its bicep. Touches a series of keys and the armor spits out what looks like. .. a small RUBIK'S CUBE made of some alien alloy. The creature casually TOSSES IT in the air where it FLOATS and starts to SPIN as it does, its sides FLIP AND TURN ( like a Rubik's Cube ) emitting HIGH-PITCHED SONAR BEEPS: This thing's some kind of HOMING BEACON. Off Emmett's WIDE, GAPING EYES.
NAT COLORADO: ( looks off ) Greavey and the others share a LOOK. E o Turn to Dolar
GREAVEY: Boss, only took one of them things to kill four of us. We got no chance here. Dolarhyde BURNS knowing he's being ABANDONED
DOLARHYDE: You're a goddamn coward. ( to the others ) m e 1 1 Qyees. And Greavey, finally FREE to speak his mind, says SPITEFULLY:
GREAVEY: Fine line between a coward and a fool. The men turn tail and RIDE AWAY. Dolarhyde SHOUTS after them
DOLARHYDE: You're all FIRED! Doc takes the opportunity to TWIST the knife:
DOC: Looks like they finally found something to be more scared of than you. Dolarhyde feels his world CRUMBLING away man by man. Ella trots alongside Jake, who's staring at that DARK CLOUD MASS overhead with a bad feeling:
JAKE: Clouds've been moving east since sun- up. 'cept that one. ON ELLA. We SENSE she knows something, something more she isn't saying. SNAPS her reins and they RIDE OFF:
ELLA: SOMETHING'S WRON
SOMETHING'S WRON: BLAMBLAN1111 GUNSHOTS from above suddenly PEPPER the ground the horses REAR and KICK UP, startled A DOZEN FIGURES ON THE CLIFFS ALL AROUND THEM. Badass OUTLAWS with RIFLES aimed at our heroes. One of them CALLS DOWN:
OUTLAW GUNMAN: EVERYBODY DRAW YOUR GUNS SLOW AND TOSS 'EM ON THE GODDAMNED GROUNDI SLOWLY, Jake draws his gun. tosses it. Now the rest of them. As they SEE TWO RIDERS incoming from the other end of the canyon. Rifles aimed and ready. Happy GROWLS. One of the outlaws knocks back the hammer on his rifle
OUTLAW: I say we just shoot 'em and take their But the words catch in his throat as his EYES WIDEN:
HUNT: What the hell you doin' back here, Oh, Christ. This is JAKE'S gang. ON DOLARHYDE. ELLA. COLORADO. All registering it. And JAKE, of course, doesn't REMEMBER these men as Bronc dismounts, NERVOUS:
BRONC: Jesus, Boss. Creek's gonna shit when he sees you. ( then; re: the others ) And who the hell're they? ON JAKE. Now does he handle this? Ht:nt rides up next to him, SUSPICIOUS, and for reasons yet to be known, UNFRIENDLY
HUNT: What's the matter, Jake. Cat got your? SMACKI Jake moves LIGHTNING FAST, SLAPS Hunt across the face, stopping the question on his tongue CATCHES the gun as it drops and presses the barrel into Hunt's NECK:
JAKE: Since when're Qy the one asking the goddamned questions!?! Ella and our people REACT as Jake plays it up, beat defense a good OFFENSE. The outlaws are SCARED: this is the Lonergan they know. Hunt holds his BLOODY MOUTH:
HUNT: Christ, Jake. You broke my tooth
JAKE: Quit whining. Now bring me to the rest of the boys, if that meets with your goddamn approval. Bronc and Hunt nod, mounting up, SHOUTING to the OUTLAWS above:
BRONC: LONERGAN'S BACK. MEET US AT THE CAMP! As they RIDE OFF, Dolarhyde looks to Jake and mutters:
DOLARHYDE: Nice company you keep.
ELLA: What the hell're you doing? If we don't catch up to that kid, we're never gonna
JAKE: They called me "Boss." You wanna go after these things with five or fifty? ( off her look ) Like you said: we can use every gun we can get. Qh. That actually makes SENSE. But
ELLA: What exactly're you gonna say to 'em?
JAKE: ( A BEAT )
DOLARHYDE'S FLASK: Tumbles from Emmett's pocket and SPLASHES WHISKEY on The Slaver IT.. S[iRIEM WILDLI-Aa THE BOOZE CONTACTS FLESH, SKIN SMOKING! EMMETT tumbles away. Terror turns to REVELATION as he PULLS the webbing from his mouth:
EMMETT: Holy SHIT. Another alien LUNGES for the kid but Emmett SPLASHES him with the flask the alien RECOILS, flesh BUBBLING Emmett whirls sees the HOVERBIKES JUMPS onto one, twisting WO ?!! Another Alien SCUTTLES in FAST Emmett's scrambling boots slide into the foot supports, which automatically WHIR CLOSED as the bike THROTTLES FORWARD. DECAPITATING THE ALIEN! The bike SPINS UNCONTROLLABLY, plasma thrusters SCORCHING WALLS and setting two more aliens ABLAZE! The speeder KAMIKAZE BOUNCES out of the cavern at 90 MPH, Emmett screaming! The Slaver SCREECHES FURIOUSLY as the remaining creatures LEAP back on their speeders and GIVE CHASE!
A TARANTULA: Climbing onto an old desert stump BLAM! It's SHOT OFF by a couple DRUNK OUTLAWS, swigging booze from STOLEN WHISKEY CRATES piled on a WAGON. We're in an OUTLAW CAMP: roughly 40 fast guns and saddle tramps. Tents. Horses. Ample weapons. And right now, most of them are GEARING UP to ride out for some reason. One of them, CREEK JOHNSON, with a chewed up face like swiss cheese, slides a RIFLE into his saddle and shouts to the drunks:
CREEK JOHNSON: Hey - ï¿½s 4 Lay off that whiskey and saddle up. Flyer's on its way and we best damn be sober for it.
CREEK JOHNSON: 'Bout time you got back. ( re: Hunt's bloody nose ) What the hell happened to you?!? Hunt nods over his shoulder
HUNT: He did. The outlaws part to reveal JAKE, riding in with Ella and the rest of our people. Creek's eyes NARROW, NOT happy to see him:
CREEK JOHNSON: well, shit. It gets very, VERY QUIET. Our people tread warily, knowing whatever reaction Jake's eliciting, it AIN'T GOOD. He runs the gaunt of ACCUSING GLARES. Smart enough to know that CREEK is the man in charge. Dismounts:
JAKE: You don't look happy to see me, Creek. Creek eyes him. TOUGH. Clearly, HISTORY here:
CREEK JOHNSON: We're fixin' to rob us a train in about twenty minutes and you come ridin' in like nothin' ever happened?
JAKE: Well I'm sure you'll get over it. Then, pretty much DISMISSING Creek, Jake turns, addresses the rest of the men. If he's their boss? Hï¿½ _gQDn&. CT LIR .ï¿½Tâ¢
BRONC: But Jake. you you said you didn't wanna be in charge no more. And this is a REVELATION. Jake glances at ELLA has to keep IMPROVISING to hold his ground:
JAKE: Well, I changed my mind. So saddle the hell up.
CREEK JOHNSON: They're not going anywhere with you. Creek's heard enough. Strides forward, a direct CHALLENGE:
ELLA: Am I who?
CREEK JOHNSON: The whore Jake quit this gang for. OH. Another piece of the puzzle falls into place Jake's eyes SNAP to Ella as they both REALIZE. the men think she's " e." Jake does his best to stay cool, meets Creek's stare:
JAKE: Watch your mouth, Creek.
CREEK JOHNSON: Or what? These boys are with = now. jID in charge. You may be fast, but you are goddamned outgunned. ON JAKE. OUR HEROES. Shit. Jake turns to the men
JAKE: That a fact, Boys? But Creek doesn't wait for them to respond:
CREEK JOHNSON: Put your guns on the whore. He so much as twitches, blow her brains out her ear. AT ONCE, 10 GUNS ARE LEVELED AT ELLA'S HEAD. No doubt as to who
JAKE: Call her a whore again, that'll be the last word you ever say.
CREEK JOHNSON: You ain't in no position to make threats, asshole. Hunt: take his gun. Hunt reluctantly scrambles over to Jake, oh-so-carefully pulls the PISTOL from Jake's holster:
HUNT: Sorry, Boss. nothin' personal. Creek now turns to BULL MCCADE, roughly the size of a BARN.
CREEK JOHNSON: Put him down, Bull. And Jake barely has time to react as Bull lets fly with a JAWBREAKING HAYMAKER that about knocks Jake out of his BOOTSI Dolarhyde and Colorado WINCE as Jake hits the dirt with a THUD Creek striding over, cock of the walk, LEANS over him:
JAKE: Don't remember. Creek NODS to Bull: SMASH! Another devastating BLOW. ON ELLA at GUNPOINT. Wishing she could intervene. DOC too.
CREEK JOHNSON: Well I _dg remember you tellin' us you was leavin' us high and dry because you were in love. You just left out the part about taking half our goddamned haul from the Yuma Bank. So I'm gonna ask you one last time Where. Is. Our. Gold? WHAM! Bull PUNCHES Jake so hard he FLIES OFF HIS FEET:
ALICE: You sure you wanna give it all up? ON JAKE. Clearly TORN. But just as clearly, in LOVE.
JAKE: What about you? Once we're gone, you ain't ever comin' back. She touches his face so gently. And whispers:
ALICE: You're the first person ever believed I was better than this place. so I gotta believe in y=. ( and she KISSES him ) You're a good man, Jake Lonergan. PRESENT: as the words "Good Man" ECHO back to Jake. Stir=g_ ]1â1n as Creek GRABS Jake's hair and YANKS BACK, rears up a fist:
CREEK JOHNSON: You figgered you could steal from us? All that gold was yours to take co you could go off and start a new life? Creek's next PUNCH takes us to another: TORY FLASECUTI REPLAY Jake and Alice in the cabin he drops the SADDLEBAG it CLINKS to the floor. She's worried:
ALICE: Your boys'ii come after you.
JAKE: ( dark, determined ) Let 'em come. BACK TO PRESENT as now Jake UNDERSTANDS the context of this moment what they were saying to each other He looks up at Creek, BEATEN AND BUSTED UP:
CREEK JOHNSON: ( TSK'S ) ( TURNS )
JAKE: Told you not to call her that. ON JAKE. Pure KILLER. As he turns his weapon on the rest of the ( awestruck ) gang through BLOODY TEETH:
DOC: Dios mio.
DOLARHYDE: ( squints, realizing. ) Jesus. it's the kid. As Emmett ROARS IN, the shocked outlaws SCATTER:
EMMETT: THEY'RE COMING!!!! THEY'RE COMING!!! The kid TUMBLES off the speeder as it PLOWS RIGHT THROUGH CAMP, kicking up DIRT and UPENDING SUPPLIES. As Emmett scrambles up
JAKE: EVERYBODY MOOOOVE!!! STEEL COLLARS START FLYING, ATTACHED TO ROPING CABLES BEFORE THE GANG KNOWS WHAT'S HAPPENING, THEY'RE BEING GRABBED AND DRAGGED AWAY! Those who have their wits about them FIRE BACK, trying to hit the flying machines. CROSSFIRE. CONFUSION.

DRAGGED AWAY!: Those who have their wits about them FIRE BACK, trying to hit the flying machines. CROSSFIRE. CONFUSION.
THE SLAVER: His speeder GROWLS to a halt. Dismounting like a killer biker. ON JAKE. As he SEES that horrible alien face across the crowd: QUICK BIT: Alice dying in his arms. And this same damn THING is the one responsible for it. And we're: BACK TO PRESENT. Jake's eyes LOCKED on the SLAVER as he says:
ANOTHER ALIEN: Hurls a boomerang-like "SMART WEAPON." It circles past the GATLING COWBOYS, BACK into the alien's hand as:
EMMETT: USE THE WHISKEY! IT BURNS EM! LIKE ACID ON THEIR SKIN!!! Ella REACTS WHAT? As an alien SKITTERS toward her, she grabs a bottle and HURLS IT it EXPLODES all over the creature! A HORRIBLE SCREECH as its skin smokes, thrashing epileptically

ELLA: ( REVELATION )
DOLARHYDE: LET'S GO!!! Our people ESCAPE for the horses. Doc climbs up on the WAGON buckboard and pulls EMMETT in the seat beside him As ELLA leaps on a horse
LET'S GO!!!: Our people ESCAPE for the horses. Doc climbs up on the WAGON buckboard and pulls EMMETT in the seat beside him As ELLA leaps on a horse
THE SLAVER: Climbs back on his speeder and GUNS FOR HER, firing a STEEL COLLAR Jake turns SEES THIS. Starts RUNNING MADLY:
JAKE: Too late: KA-CHANK! The collar CLAMPS her neck, RIPPING ELLA OFF HER HORSE! The CABLE snaps back and attaches to the hovercraft as it ZIPS by, DRAGGING ELLA BACKWARD LIKE A WATER
ELLA!!: Too late: KA-CHANK! The collar CLAMPS her neck, RIPPING ELLA OFF HER HORSE! The CABLE snaps back and attaches to the hovercraft as it ZIPS by, DRAGGING ELLA BACKWARD LIKE A WATER
HYAA!: EXT. DESERT - CONTINUOUS ELLA'S DRAGGED BEHIND THE SPEEDER. Hands GRASPING at the magnetic collar as it HALF-CHOKES HER, yet keeps her upper body SUSPENDED just oft the ground while her heels BOUNCE HARSHLY
PINKERTON #1: You hear.that?
PINKERTON #2: How many times I gotta tell you, Leonard. No one'd be stupid enough to rob this tr
REACHES OUT: TAKE MY HAND! She GRUNTS WITH EXERTION as their fingers GRAZE each other and The Slaver SNAPS AROUND. Hurls a SMART DISC at Jake no choice, he LETS GO of the LADDER HITS the ground PAINFULLY
JAKE: TAKE MY HAND! She GRUNTS WITH EXERTION as their fingers GRAZE each other and The Slaver SNAPS AROUND. Hurls a SMART DISC at Jake no choice, he LETS GO of the LADDER HITS the ground PAINFULLY
JAKE: Her head just falls back. Yeah. Hard to swallow, but it's true. ELLA'S DEAD. And if this moment ECHOES Jake holding his dead wife, well that's just fine. He stares beseechingly as. HOOFBEATS. The rest of our people gallop in: Colorado, Dolarhyde, Doc and Emmett in the wagon:
EMMETT: Aw no. is she ? Jake looks up unhinged
NAT COLORADO: We need to get out of here NOT.
JAKE: I remember now.
CRACKS ): But I couldn't save either of you. A beat. his bound hands gently touch her face.
JAKE: HEY! GODDAMMIT DON'T YOU TOUCH THROWN RIGHT INTO THE FLAMES. Jake helplessly watches her BURN.
EMMETT: Wasn't your fault, Mr. Lonergan. Those things. were lookin' for her. Had a picture and everything. That breaks the spell. Jake looks over
JAKE: What d'you mean. 'a picture'?
EMMETT: Floatin', like that arrow thing we found in its eye. Before Jake can makes sense of this, a teepee smoke flap OPENS and out steps the tribe's SACHEM. This is GREY WOLF dark, wrinkled face enhanced by TATTOOS. He takes one look at his prisoners and SPEAKS A FEW WORDS OF APACHE.
DOC: What'd he say?
COLORADO: "Kill them. And make it quick." Doc is amply freaked. Turns to Jake as FIVE OF THE BRAVES move for them, MENACING
DOC: Now'd be a good time to use your gun bracelet, my friend. But Jake is VACANT. BROKEN. All the fight seems GONE from him. His bracelet DOESN'T MOVE. Dolarhyde's grabbed first. PULLED FORWARD by one of the braves, raising his TOMAHAWK they're really gonna KILL HIM
DOLARRYDE: ( SUBTITLED )
COLORADO: Yeah. he's my father. REACTIONS. JAKE. EMMETT. DOC. Stunned silence. And so:
EMMETT: Hey! What about =?!? ON DOLAR. A FLASH of regret. But it's gone fast.
DOLARHYDE: What about you, kid? And he just walks out of the camp, leaving his son behind. GONE. And now, it's back to business
JAKE: What're you waiting for, asshole? DO IT. And as Jake's about to MEET HIS DEATH:
ELLA: . what. happened? ON JAKE. Holy. SHIT. Everyone else equally STUNNED.
EMMETT: You. died.
ELLA: ( QUIETLY; CAUGHT )
ELLA: If I'd told you on the boat, you never would'a trusted me but he takes a step BACK. If he's relieved she's alive, he isn't showing it:
JAKE: Did you hear what I said?
ELLA: .. What?
JAKE: When you were playin' possum. Did you hear what I mid? He's angry. Yes, even embarrassed. And because of it, something has SHUT DOWN in him again. That killer look is back.
ELLA: No. I was mendin'.
JAKE: How's it you look like one of us?
ELLA: I can look like whatever I want to.
JAKE: So you can't die?
ELLA: Sure I can. If my heart stops beating. just like you.
.JAKE: You're nothin' like me, Ella. You're one'a them. we can see that hurt her. But she deserved it, too. So desperately wants to reach him.
ELLA: I'm not, Jake. I'm from a different He isn't sure what that means. Can he even trust her? Either way, she has ANSWER;. Darkly:
JAKE: The one that took you.
ELLA: They call him The Slaver. He's the one, gave me the scars. Broke me. And made me watch. while he killed my family Even with his guard up. Jake can't help but be STRUCK. As the sound of HOWLING WIND takes us to:
ELLA: Our race was first to map the stars. that's why they came for us. Took our planet, piece by piece. Slaughtered anyone who fought hack. Ones who survived were turned into slaves. She says this meeting the eyes of GREY WOLF. There's immediate SIMPATICO here: a story the Indians could be telling.
JAKE: X lead 'em here. Ella swallows. Wracked with GUILT.
EMMETT: Well damn, lady, thanks a 1.
ELLA: I never wanted this. ( an EMOTIONAL beat ) But they got. ways. Of making you do Her eyes are HAUNTED with memory. The inference is some kind of TORTURE. She pushes it away staying strong:
JAKE: Where is it. Jake's determined he's got his OWN agenda. Ella looks up to that OMINOUS CLOUD. Those BLUE LIGHT FLASHES ripple within:
ELLA: Hiding in that cloud. Way I figure, they'll find enough fuel to leave by tomorrow, midday. Then they'll bring back the others.
DOC: The whole fleet. They'll take what they need. Everyone on this planet. Anything too weak to survive. they'll toss. Like that cow. Tomorrow. Midday. Hi noon. This is bad, bad news.
ELLA: The whole fleet. They'll take what they need. Everyone on this planet. Anything too weak to survive. they'll toss. Like that cow. Tomorrow. Midday. Hi noon. This is bad, bad news.
NAT COLORADO: What'd you mean, they're looking for And before Ella can answer, Jake already GETS IT:
JAKE: Gold. That's why they're in a mine.
ELLA: ( NODS, solemn ) . wherever it is, that's where you escaped from and it's the only way back up to the ship.
JAKE: I I blasted my way out. MEMORY FLASHCUTI REPLAY POV as we RUN through the cavern ESCAPE a LIGHT at the end of the tunnel BLINDING SUN hits us as we emerge our eyes ADJUST to see:
ELLA: What? What's he sayin'?!? Colorado turns to Jake, a flicker of HOPE:
COLORADO: That rock you're talkin' about. he- knows where it is.
SHERIFF TAGGART: You. all right.? DRIFTING over to see MARIA. Gravity PULLING her hair downward. Groggy. Mostly SCARED:
MARIA: ( BRAVE FACE )
PERCY DOLARHYDE: H HEY!!! THE HELL'S THA?!
KYLE!!!!: ANOTHER METAL TENTACLE slithers in and GRABS WADE swinging our men across the cavern where we reveal. . the tentacles are attached to a TERRIFYING ALIEN MACHINE. Taggart and Wade are PINNED DOWN on what looks like an operating table. As they thrash, RESTRAINING CLAMPS enfold their skulls. An OCULAR PROBE looms _Q.Xpr. them, This is the image _ e.'_A_beM1_ seeing! This is what haRpened to him before he escaRe ! WORKER-BEE ALIENS adjusts the device over their eyes INSTANT X-RAYS read their retinas HYPNOTIC as the men grow DOCILE and LIMP despite their fight and FLASHFLASHTLASHI The probe has ERASED THEIR MINDS. Catatonic stares. Now the machine arms slip the men into separate TRANSLUCENT CAPSULES. METAL BREATHING TUBES are implanted down their throats as the capsules begin to fill with a THICK, BLUE LIQUID. This is the same blue goo a protective gel that housed the COW in that jettisoned cocoon in the desert. More Worker Bees load the cocoons into TRANSPORT SHUTTLECRAFTS. We see containment holds filled with BLEATING COWS and REARING HORSES. all going through a similar cocooning process. All of this is overseen by THE SLAVER, who stalks up a ramp behind the cocoons. The craft HUMS to life, undergear retracting as it ROARS OFF down the tunnel.
NAT COLORADO: This is Kiowa land, their sister tribe. As they near the bluff, Jake sees the STONE TOWER. Dismounts:
JAKE: That's it. As they near the bluff, they hear the growing sound of that MACHINERY. Everyone dips low, peering over to see.
DOC: Holy Jesus. Like a damn fort. Grey Wolf looks to his men, GRAVE, CRESTFALLEN as he realizes:
ELLA: Transports. Way they get people and gold back and forth to the ship.
DOC: Place is crawling with those things. We'll never even get close. Grey Wolf SPEAKS
NAT COLORADO: He says there's a back way in. The Twin Rivers run underneath this whole canyon. Limestone tunnels up by the falls, couple miles East. Lead right down there. Jake looks to the SKY. DARK. DETERMINED.
JAKE: The Slaver. he's up in that big cloud? Ella nods, HARD. Off their SHARED DETERMINATION, our SCORE rises. A DRUM CADENCE that suggests a MISSION starting to form:
DOC: Just so I got this straight. three of those things just kicked the shit out of your entire gang, took our whole town, and now you two're gonna ride right into that fort, try to hijack one'a those He pauses on the word
ELLA: ride it up to that space boat
DOC: ride it up to that space boat
ELLA: Then bring it down here and get everybody off alive? That's your big plan? Jake and Ella share a LOOK. Simply:
DOC: Then bring it down here and get everybody off alive? That's your big plan? Jake and Ella share a LOOK. Simply:
JAKE: And just how do you figure on getting in there in the first place?
DOC: And just how do you figure on getting in there in the first place?
JAKE: Poke a hornet's nest. they swarm You gotta draw 'em out. Buy us a A long beat of incredulous, do-you-believe-this-shit STARES:
ELLA: You gotta draw 'em out. Buy us a A long beat of incredulous, do-you-believe-this-shit STARES:
DOC: You want us to storm that fort? Against those things? With less than fifty men? It's suicide.
EMMETT: It ain't, it's been done! I read at school how Ethan Allen and his Green Mountain Boys took Fort Ticonderoga, they weren't but a small garrison and they were outgunned
ELLA: We need all of you to make a stand. Together. It's the only way.
NAT COLORADO: Make a stand with what? Jake turns to the WAGON they rode from Jake's gang camp the WHISKEY CRATES. Sweeps up a bottle:
JAKE: An impossible mission. Sure death. Yet for the first time. they have an ADVANTAGE. Emmett cuts the moment with a BIG GRIN:
EMMETT: Hell, yeah. Let's squish some bugs. Grey Wolf CHUCKLES, murmurs. Jake looks to Nat for translation:
JAKE: Somethin' funny?
NAT COLORADO: Yeah. that you whites finally know what it feels like to face extinction. Now that we're on the same side, he says we can all die together.
JAKE: Guess that means you're not waitin' for your dad to come back. Colorado's face CLOUDS. Years of ANGER and RESENTMENT:
NAT COLORADO: Been Woodrow Dolarhyde's son my whole life. first time he ever copped to it was to save his own ass. ( not without emotion ) He's not comin' back. And as Colorado TURNS away, the PERCUSSION finds another GEAR
JAKE: Not you, Kid.
EMMETT: Aw, hell, we been through this. Ya can't stop me. Jake draws his gun, SPINS it in his palm, aims at Emmett's FOOT:
JAKE: I can shoot you in the foot.
EMMETT: Jake SIGHS bluff called. Holsters the gun and takes a knee. but just when we think this is gonna be a tender moment, he GRABS Emmett by the collar, pulls him CLOSE:
JAKE: You told me your daddy's all you got left. Want me to save his ass? Then park yours right there on the ground, you little shit. Got me? Emmett's nailed. ANGRY, but knows he's gotta stay.
EMMETT: Yeah. I gotcha. Jake releases him. Happy moves to Ella but she TSKS:
ELLA: Stay with the kid, Happy. The dog WHINES but complies, moving next to Emmett. Jake climbs on his horse. Looks back to the boy now he Ia tender:
JAKE: I'll get your father back. Bastard still owes me fifty dollars. The hint of a SMIRK. long enough for Emmett to SMIRK BACK. Ella, Doc, and Colorado mount Â»p too, along with a 10-MAN APACHE WAR PARTY. Jake meets eyes with GREY WOLF:
ELLA: That's a nice thing. what you said to the boy. I didn't know better, I'd say you got yourself a sweet side. She smiles. But Jake turns to her deadly serious:
JAKE: There's nothin' sweet about me. I told that kid what he needed to hear so he wouldn't get in my damn way. All I care about is killin' that thing. And Ella reacts to the DARKNESS in his voice. Shakes her head:
ELLA: I don't believe that.
JAKE: Well believe it. I was playing a part. ( straight at her ) Just like you were. He CRACKS the reins, riding ahead. HOLD ON ELLA. who finally follows as they all ride out and MUSIC SOARS:
THE WOMAN: Is he okay?
DOLARHYDE: He's gonna be. A storm of mixed emotions in his eyes. That stoic Dolarhyde veneer starts to CRACK. just a hint. as the woman MOVES to him. and TOUCHES his face. And he lets her. WHOA. We realize: this woman is COLORADO'S MOTHER. Dolarhyde, for all his wicked bluster, LOVES AN APACHE.
THE WOMAN: ( SOFTLY )
JAKE: You and Percy're brothers, huh?
NAT COLORADO: . half.
JAKE: So. your momma and Dolarhyde-
NAT COLORADO: We friends now? Last I checked, you shot my ear off.
JAKE: ( a beat; then ) Want it back?
OUTLAW: BRONC and HUNT look up. Draws their GUNS. So does the rest of the gang. until they see the rider's waving a WHITE FLAG. As he comes closer they realize it's DOLARHYDE:
BRONC!: BRONC and HUNT look up. Draws their GUNS. So does the rest of the gang. until they see the rider's waving a WHITE FLAG. As he comes closer they realize it's DOLARHYDE:
HUNT: One of them fellas Jake was ridin' with! Dolarhyde rides into camp, REARING in front of 30 guns
BRONC: The hell you want?
DOLARHYDE: It's about what you want. He reaches into his pocket and tosses Bronc a GOLD COIN:
BRONC: Who's got your boy?
DOLARHYDE: Well, there's the rub.
DOC: In case we live through this. They SNEAK on down the narrow shaft til they're funneled into.
JAKE: We're never gonna get close to that ship. Silently. a DRIPPING. GLISTENING SHAPE rises un from the WATER behind them. Swaying like a COBRA ready to strike: Our people TURN. the TUBE ALIEN snatches one of the Apaches, SWALLOWING HIM in its thorny snout! The indian SCREAMS
JAKE: Lights a WHISKEY MOLOTOV, hurls it at the CREATURE: BOOM! It KEENS, BURNING, SPITTING OUT the Apache. ALERTED, the dozen aliens by the transport SWARM at our heroes!
NAT COLORADO: C g_that shuttle. Colorado readies his TOMAHAWK Jake meets his eyes:
JAKE: Knew there was a good reason I didn't kill you.
NAT COLORADO: Just thinkin' the same thing. The men trade FATEFUL LOOKS. then the Indians HURL MOLOTOVS at the charging horde: KAAA-BOOM! Aliens TWIST and SCREAM The Apaches STRIKE FEARLESSLY but the aliens quickly RECOVER and SHAKE THEM OFF, tearing most of them to SHREDS. The horses BREAK FREE and crash madly through the cavern And this is the DISTRACTION Jake and Ella need to make their run, for the transport up the loading ramp:
ELLA: Jake - - ( he can only stare )
ELLA: Strap in. dammit!!!
JAKE: Into what?!? Ella JAMS a lever forward and the shuttle RISES. JAKE grabs WEBBING that must be some type of SEATBELT, feeling the sensation of ELLQU as:
LET'S GO!!!: DOC comes RUNNING frantically:
DOC: DON'T LEAVE ME!!! Colorado PULLS Doc up onto the horse's bare back no easy task with Doc's 300 POUNDS. The remaining Apaches ( 5 ) commandeer horses and GALLOP HARD down the tunnel Two aliens jump on MANTA-SPEEDERS in pursuit!
ELLA: Hold on.
JAKE: INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNELS - CONTINUOUS The rest of our heroes GALLOP FAST out the criss-crossing tunnels KA-CHINNNG! Apaches are CLAMPED WITH STEEL COLLARS and YANKED off their horses as the SPEEDERS roar in from behind! Colorado VEERS toward a LIGHT as Doc ignites a molotov and they:
DOC: They're gaining on us!
NAT COLORADO: That's the point! And just when it looks like Doc and Colorado are GONERS. BOOM! An EXPLOSION rocks the canyon as something HURTLES DOWN from above WHISKEY MOLOTOVS fired from the handmade CATAPULTS. BOOM! BOOM! Aliens are VAPORIZED, SHRIEKING! A cloudburst of FLAMING ARROWS brightens the sky as 20 APACHES RISE UP along the canyon rims: A AMBUSH! An ASSEMBLY LINE OF SQUAWS works like a drill team, soaking WHISKEY RAGS and wrapping arrows. Among them, EMMETT and HAPPY! The kid pocks an arrow like a damn EXPERT IGNITES it lets it FLY WHOOSH! It SKEWERS a speeder pilot who BURSTS INTO FLAMES, the speeder CORKSCREWS into another one, both EXPLODING:
EMMETT: THE ALIENS
YEAHHHHH!!!: THE ALIENS
THE ALIENS: Caught OFF-GUARD with NO WM TO TURN AROUND as from the OPPOSITE END of the canyon, a BELLOWING WAR WHOOP:
ELLA JAKE: Dammit - what?
WHAT'S WRQNG?: she's CLIMBING back up the ladder, he FOLLOWS:
ELLA: Engines are warming up got eight minutes til the ship leaves, and about one til automated retrieval
JAKE: autojamated what ?
ELLA: Hug the wall. Jake does that beside her as the next bolt PINGS out
JAKE: I'll aim just fine. THE LAST BOLT FIRES and the airlock door SHOOTS OFF:
ELLA: She JUMPS through the airlock Jake has no time to think:
C'MON!: She JUMPS through the airlock Jake has no time to think:
JAKE: And JUMPS after her
DAMMIT: And JUMPS after her
ELLA: she PULLS HIM into an alcove as a machine arm SWINGS overhead, flashing a WIDE CONICAL LASER that inventories cocoons like the machine in the underground cave. As they CROUCH:
Ï¿½CIDYAPLQLWJJ: she PULLS HIM into an alcove as a machine arm SWINGS overhead, flashing a WIDE CONICAL LASER that inventories cocoons like the machine in the underground cave. As they CROUCH:
JAKE: Slaver's up there?
ELLA: I sure as hell hope not.
JAKE: Then I'm not goin' with you. And now she HARDENS
ELLA: You got any idea how big this ship is? No ray you'll ever find him alone. Be like findin' a needle in a SLAM!! Jake interrupts her by aiming at the LASER SCANNER and FIRING HIS BLASTER, blowing it apart. The scanner eye CRASHES to the floor, flaming. A KLAXON rings
JAKE: I ain't gonna find him. He's gonna find Thanks for the head start. She turns and RUNS. Jake moves to that scanner eye on the floor, walks right up to it and STARES into the shattered IRIS:
ELLA: Thanks for the head start. She turns and RUNS. Jake moves to that scanner eye on the floor, walks right up to it and STARES into the shattered IRIS:
JAKE: Alright, you sonofabitch. come and get INT. ALIEN SCOUT SHIP - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS JAKE'S FACE APPEARS AS A THERMAL HEAT SOURCE fritzing as he stares into the scanner. ALARMS scream. THE SLAVER fills with RAGE. And RECOGNITION. Aliens begin grabbing WEAPONS but The Slaver SHRIEKS for them to STOP. We don't need to speak alien to understand: "He's mine. "
JAKE: ( QUIETLY; HARD )
DOC: I need more bandages now!/ You: lint and splint that leg!
NAT COLORADO: You came back!
DOLARHYDE: Told you: I take care of my kin. Colorado knows that's as close to "I love you" as he'll ever get. But the UPSWING is short-lived as: A speeder WHIZZES past, dropping a METALLIC BUNDLE. It splits open right in front of the fort's STEEL GATES pieces hydraulically ASSEMBLING THEMSELVES in seconds, becoming: THE MOTHERFUCKING SUPERGUN_OF DEATH. TWO LETHAL BARRELS spin to life, firing STRANGE STEEL BALL BEARINGS in every direction. CLAW HOOKS snap out of the balls, EMBEDDING in soldiers! One LODGES in a GANG MEMBER beside DOC he FLAILS:
GANG MEMBER: HELP ME!!! GET IT OFF! A RED SPRING-LOADED PIN depresses in the ball's center: KA-BOOM!
DOC: DON'T. STOP, DAMMIT!!!! The RED PIN starts to depress pOC LUNGES, JAMS HIS FINGER RETJff&H_THE PIN AND BLASTING CAP. Now he's stopped it from exploding, but if he pulls his finger out. HE DIES TOO. DOC and GREY WOLF lock eyes. Their fates suddenly ENTWINED as
JAKE: Drop the woman. We both know this ain't about her. But The Slaver only presses his blaster HARDER into Ella's neck. Almost GRINNING. And Jake MEETS the look
ELLA: BEHIND YOU!!! Jake WHIRLS, SLAM!!! The creature FLIES off its feet.
BEHIND YOU!!!: Jake WHIRLS, SLAM!!! The creature FLIES off its feet.
JAKE: Stay down. Ella does, and here come the rest of the aliens as Jake GUNS
ELLA: Reactor's hit. if I don't get this ship on the ground soon, we're all dead. ( tries to STAND, WINCES ) Get me over to that turbolift. He slings an arm around her shoulder and LIFTS her, helping her to the elevator
COMPASSION ): Go do what you came up here to do. He looks at her. At the blood. At the unstable REACTOR. And Jake Lonergan makes a CHOICE:
JAKE: he gets INTO THE ELEVATOR with her. She SLAMS the control pad, doors CLOSE they start rocketing upward. She half-grins as her eyes hold on him. And within them. trust. AND FAITH.
DOLARHYDE: DON'T BREAK RANKS! HOLD YOUR LINES GODDAMIT! WE CAN TAKE THIS FOR Colorado picks up his father and they start RUNNING LOW under stray beams of PLASMA FIRE, reaching Doc and Grey Wolf:
DOC: Tell him to hold still! If I have this thing figured right, long as t keep my finger under the red pin we won't blow GREY WOLF ( SUBTITLE ) What's he saying?:
COLORADO: We need to pull it out of his shoulder!
DOLARHYDE: I'm not pullin' anything!
DOC: Dolarhyde gets an IDEA. HARDENS. Looks Doc right in the eye:
SHIT!: Dolarhyde gets an IDEA. HARDENS. Looks Doc right in the eye:
DOLARHYDE: Alright, listen you slide your finger from under that pin, I'll slip mine in and hold it in place. Then you pull it out and I'll throw it. Doc NODS fearfully. Dolar carefully SLIPS his finger under the pin as Doc SLIPS it out. PHEW. Now Doc takes hold of the grenade itself, nods "ready" to pull it out. Grey Wolf braces
DOC: On three.
DOLARHYDE: Everyone LURCHES from the tension interrupt:
DOC: your wife. Maria. We had an arrangement. I left your saloon alone and she paid me off. ON DOC. Reeling, now REALLY confused
DOLARHYDE: your wife. Maria. We had an arrangement. I left your saloon alone and she paid me off. ON DOC. Reeling, now REALLY confused
DOC: We're broke. Paid you off with what?
DOLARHYDE: She stole from the people in your morgue. Gold teeth, trinkets, pocket watches It LANDS on Doc: that's why he fond the watch under their bed.
DOC: I thought she was cheating!
DOLARHYDE: Just robbin' corpses.
DOC: Thank God! ( and then ) Wait. You hate me. Why're you telling me this? With GENUINE REMORSE:
DOLARHYDE: May not get another chance
DOC: WHAT'RE YOU
WHAT'RE YOU: Dolarhyde looks at Colorado:
DOLARHYDE: Tell your mother I love her. With that, he CHARGES into the swirling chaos
NAT COLORADO: but BOOM! Colorado's FORCED BACK by an explosion through the debris, he sees his father running toward.
WAIT!: but BOOM! Colorado's FORCED BACK by an explosion through the debris, he sees his father running toward.

ELLA: We're going down fast. She calls up telemetry on a HOLO-WINDOW: EARTH TERRAIN The BATTLEFIELD. Sets coordinates, vectoring the ship that way: A WHIR as a SECOND TURBOLIFT arrives. AND THE SLAVER STEPS QQT. Wounded, and very PISSED OFF. Jake says to Ella:
JAKE: No matter what. Jake and The Slaver HURTLE into each other, TUMBLE off a catwalk, CRASHING into conduits and GUNKY WATER below. Jake staggers up but The Slaver is HUGE SLAMS Jake back into the water. PINS A FOOT on his blaster arm CRUSHING IT. Jake HOWLS as The Slaver presses a series of those HIEROGLYPH MARKINGS on Jake's BRACELET the symbols LIGHT UP in an UNLOCK CODE and KA-CHING! The bracelet POPS OF.E. The Slaver TOSSES IT into the gunky water. Draws his LASER WHIP WHUP-SNAP! The white-hot tip LASHES JAKE'S BACK, ripping his shirt and BURN-SCARRING HIS BACK! Jake SCREAMS in agony as The Slaver WHIPS HIM MERCILESSLY
JAKE: Go to hell.
ELLA: I lied.
JAKE: . I know.
ELLA: No, I heard what you said when I was layin' there.
EMMETT: PAW!!!! PAW!!!! The kid GRABS his father and holds him for dear life, as Taggart stares back in a daze
PAW!!!! PAW!!!!: The kid GRABS his father and holds him for dear life, as Taggart stares back in a daze
COLORADO: Moving through the FALLEN BODIES toward the lifeless form of Dolarhyde, his FATHER. Eyes welling, he drops to his knees.
PERCY: What. happened? And all Colorado can say is.
NAT COLORADO: He's dead. That HANGS there. Percy blinks. And then
PERCY: Who's gettin' the ranch? ON COLORADO. At first, words that don't compute. Then PURE BLIND RAGE takes hold and his FISTS FLY, PUNCHING PERCY:
LIFE!: DOLARHYDE ( O.S. ) Colorado WHIRLS DOLARHYDE IS STAGGERING TO HIS FEET, ALIVE!
HEY!: Colorado WHIRLS DOLARHYDE IS STAGGERING TO HIS FEET, ALIVE!
PERCY: Paw, he Dolarhyde SMACKS Percy across the face:
UOLARHYUE: For being an ungrateful little bastard. Now shake your brother's hand and thank him for saving your ass, cause it's more than you ever would'a done bjM.
JAKE: Staggers through the crowd. And sees ELLA. Thgy did it. But she still looks TROUBLED. Staring out at the vast desert.
JAKE: . what is it?
ELLA: We didn't get all of 'em. Some ran oft. That LANDS on Jake, as he too looks toward the endless horizon. HOLD on them, together, a VICTORIOUS but UNRESOLVED note. We RISE UP over the sea of bodies and the CRASHED SHIP, until Jake and Ella are just two small figures in the crowd.
SHERIFF TAGGART: EMMETT! GET OVER HERE!!!
EMMETT: what? What'd I dQ?
SHERIFF TAGGART: Kid's got a mouth on him.
DEPUTY WADE: Well, Kyle, considering he saved your life, guess you'll just have to grin'n bear it. Dolar moves up to Taggart, tough as ever. The men HOLD looks:
SHERIFF TAGGART: Percy STEWS about something. Dolar WHACKS him upside the head:
DOLARHYDE: Percy STEWS about something. Dolar WHACKS him upside the head:
SHERIFF TAGGART: What's this?
DOLARHYDE: Claims to the land 50 miles west of here. I've signed it over to the township of ( off Taggart's LOOK ) Considering I'm a businessman, I figure expansion's in both our interests. Needs the Sheriff's signature to be official.
SHERIFF TAGGART: Fifty miles west of here is where the goldmine is, Woodrow.
DOLARHYDE: ( A BEAT )
SHERIFF TAGGART: What's this about twenty percent going to the Apaches? Dolarhyde glances at Colorado. A moment. But the hardened rancher maintains his rock-solid facade:
DOLARHYDE: Figure the only way not to piss 'em off is to buy 'em.
SHERIFF TAGGART: Since when'd you worry about pissin' anyone off?
DOLARHYDE: Just sign it, Goddamnit. With a grin, Taggart gestures for Deputy Wade to turn around and flattens the paper on his BACK, using it as a surface to SIGN:
SHERIFF TAGGART: I'd say you were being generous, Woodrow, but I know you'd just be insulted.
DOLARHYDE: Damn right. Dolar gives his hat a TIP, then mounts up to go and we RISE UP to the UPPER FLOOR of the GOLD LEAF SALOON, in the process of being rebuilt in grand style and MOVE IN on a WINDOW where:
DOC MARIA: SHH! The workers will hear us!!! Let them hear! As they TUMBLE back onto the bed, Doc LURCHES. Reaches under his back to find. a GOLD POCKETWATCH.
DOC: What is this?
MARIA: Look at the inscription. He flips it open to find an ENGRAVING: "MI CORAZON. POR SIEMPRE." Doc looks up at her, MOVED. Then PLAYFULLY:
DOC: This looks like Aldo Mayberry's watch.
MARIA: Shut up and kiss me. She pulls him down, OUT OF FRAME
ELLA: Second damn time that dog ran off on me.
JAKE: Second time he brought me to you. Happy's tail wags. The look between Jake and Ella HOLDS. And it seems freighted with everything. Finally, he breaks it glancing at the Apaches finishing their work with the dynamite, and the remnants of the ALIEN SHIP and FORTRESS below.
ELLA: Where you headed?
JAKE: ( A BEAT )
ELLA: . Yep. ( then; off her look ) She walks right up to his horse. Right up to HIM:
JAKE: . Yep. ( then; off her look ) She walks right up to his horse. Right up to HIM:
ELLA: I think you're ridin' off cause you're just scared of what'll happen if you An INFERENCE here. Ella's going BOLD. Jake swings off his horse, lands beside her. Now. Almost CURIOUS:
JAKE: And what's gonna happen?
ELLA: You know. A CHARGE between them. All they wanna do is KISS. But that'd be too easy. And those wounds of his, they haven't quite healed. He drops his eyes; SOFTLY NOW:
JAKE: If I stay. it's not gonna be good for anybody, Ella. A beat. She looks off. Nods. They say nothing. And now he slowly climbs back on his horse. Ella TOUGHENS:
ELLA: Heard some rumors outta Abilene. Weird noises at night. Cattle mutilations. Weather phenomena. Figured I'd ride down there. Give it a look-see.
JAKE: ( his eyes narrow ) What's 'phenomena'?
ELLA: Big storms in places that don't get big ON JAKE. Every fighting instinct in him suddenly IGNITED, though he plays it down:
JAKE: You goin' down there yourself?
ELLA: Why? You worried about me? You bet your ass he is. But, he shakes his head
JAKE: No, ma'am. You can take care of yourself just fine. ( then; tips his hat ) Be seein' you around.
ELLA: goodbye, Jake. He gets back on his horse. Starts to ride off. Happy BARKS and trots alongside him. BARK BARK BARK. In dog that means "Don't be an idiot." Jake glances over
JAKE: Get the hell away from me, you damn mutt.
