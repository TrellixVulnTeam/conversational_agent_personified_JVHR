CORALINE: Looks more like slime to me.
CHARLIE: Well, it's slime or bedtime fusspot now what's it going to be?
CORALINE: Think they're trying to poison me?
CORALINE: Don't forget about me, guys. Okay?
CORALINE: She catches her breath, pulls the door wider and CRAWLS
CORALINE: She looks around, notices the painting over the fireplace: the crying blue boy is now SMILING, his shirt clean and his ice cream back on his cone.

CORALINE: Miss Spink and Forcible? But you said they're dingbats.
MEL: ( NODS ) Uh huh.
CORALINE: Smells something bad, sniffs the envelopes.

OTHER MOTHER: You could stay here forever. if you want to.
CORALINE: OTHER FATHER

OTHER FATHER: No point; he pulled a long face.
OTHER ORCHARD: Coraline runs past trees that are LUSH WITH GREEN LEAVES
CAT: And what do you think you're doing?
CORALINE: Well, I'm gettin' outta here. That's what I'M doing.

BOY GHOST: Gave all that we asked -
BOY GHOST: She said that she loved us,
ALL GHOSTS: And ate up our lives.
CORALINE: Well, she can't keep me in the dark forever; not if she wants to win my life. Beating her is my only chance.
