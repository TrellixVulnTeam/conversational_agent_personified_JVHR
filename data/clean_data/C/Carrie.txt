CARRIE: Written by
STELLA: Hiya, Carrie. Gee you gave me a fright. How long have you been there?
CARRIE: ( not smiling; pointing with her finger ) What are those?
STELLA: Those are my breasts, honey.
CARRIE: ( a beat; then solemnly ) I wish I had some.
STELLA: You will. `Course you'll have to wait a couple of years, but ­
CARRIE: ( a fact ) No I won't.
STELLA: Why, sure you will.
CARRIE: ( emphatic ) No, I won't. ( glancing behind her ) Momma says no. Momma says good girls don't.
STELLA: ( at something of a loss )
CARRIE: Momma calls them dirtypillows. Says she's got them `cuz she was bad when she made me.
STELLA: Momma calls them dirtypillows. Says she's got them `cuz she was bad when she made me.
CARRIE: Momma calls them dirtypillows. Says she's got them `cuz she was bad when she made me.
STELLA: Now, honey, that's just silly. Listen ­ you must be real hot in that long dress. What do you say we go inside and get us some lemonade, would you like that?
STELLA: ( offering her hand ) It'll be our secret.
CARRIE: I can't!
STELLA: Sure you can. I make it nice and sweet, and ­
MARGARET: 8 CARRIE, STELLA
CAARRIEETTAAA!!!: 8 CARRIE, STELLA
10. STELLA: Stands there, riveted. Not knowing what's happened, what to do. It's utterly silent for a And then, an incredible CACOPHONY of strange sounds starts coming from the White house ­ an unearthly babble as Margaret White screams, rants, and screeches; as Carrie sobs that she's sorry, that she forgot.
STELLA: ( louder )
MRS. HORAN: What in the name of God? What's the matter?
STELLA: ( frantic ) I don't know. Carrie was just talking to me, and Mrs. White started screaming and.
STELLA: Don't you yell at her like that! Stop that!
MRS. HORAN: That poor sweet child.
STELLA: Mother, we've got to do something!
MRS. HORAN: Call the police? Mother, call the police!
STELLA: Call the police? Mother, call the police!
MRS. HORAN: ( not about to interfere; hopeless ) The child.
MARGARET'S VOICE: Stop that! Stop that!
MARGARET'S VOICE: Carrie stops, turns to reply into the house.
CARRIE: Yes, Momma.
MARGARET'S VOICE: You come straight home from school.
CARRIE: ( sweetly ) I always do, Momma.
BOBBY: Hey, fart-face! Hey, old praying Carrie! Praying, Carrie, praying Carrie, praying Carrie!
FROMM'S VOICE: What are you going to leave for us, You people in your big cars Spewing pollution into the air?
FROMM'S VOICE: You people with heavy feet Trampling down the wilderness? You people who peer into the back seats of our cars Hours after you come out of the back doors of your motels. Soon all we will have is each other, and that could be enough.
FROMM: .If you will let us have room enough And air enough And peace enough To love each other As you never could
28 FROMM: He is nodding his head slowly, affecting a kind of puzzlement.
FROMM: I must say ­ I must confess ­ this poem displays an extraordinary .a talent extraordinary for you, Tommy Ross.
30 FROMM: Tommy, this is slightly different from running for a touchdown. Any criticisms?
FROMM: Tommy, this is slightly different from running for a touchdown. Any criticisms?
32 FROMM: He appears surprised to see Carrie, ordinarily shy, volunteering.
FROMM: Carrie White?
CARRIE: It's. beautiful.
34 FROMM: He leaves his desk, moving into the class area, seeming to pounce on Carrie.
FROMM: `Beautiful.' `Bee-t-ti-ful!' `Oh beautiful for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain.' Is that the beautiful you mean?
FROMM: That isn't exactly a criticism, Miss White. Anyone else? Well, at least we've finally gotten Carrie White
TOMMY: ( muttering ) You suck.
FROMM: Tommy? You said something?
TOMMY: Yes, sir. I said. `shucks.'
35 OMITTED: 36 EXT. VOLLEYBALL COURT ­ DAY
COLLINS: Okay, now. This is game point.
RHONDA: ( giving the score ) Twenty ­ Twenty.
CHRIS: ( low, harsh ) You eat shit!
COLLINS: What are you waiting for, Carrie? Bell in five minutes.
CARRIE: Oh uh?
CHRIS: Peer-iod! Peer-iod!
GIRLS: Peer-iod! Peer-iod! Peer-iod! Peer-iod!
NORMA: Plug it up!
GIRLS: Plug it up! Plug it up! Plug it up! Plug it up!
SUE: For God's sakes, Carrie, you got your period. Clean yourself up!
SUE: ( furiously ) You're bleeding! You dumb pudding, you're bleeding!
NORMA: She thinks they're for lipstick.
GIRLS: Plug it up, plug it up, plug it up, plug it up..
COLLINS: What is this?
COLLINS: ( to girls ) Get out! Get out!
SUE: It must be her first.
COLLINS: As the girls slip out, Collins turns to Carrie, who has backed up and is whimpering. Collins slaps her face, not too hard at first, then with a flash of anger.
CARRIE: M. M. Miss Collins.
COLLINS: Stand up. Take care of yourself.
CARRIE: I'm bleeding. Damn you!
COLLINS: Damn you!
COLLINS: Get over there! And take one!
CARRIE: I don't know.
COLLINS: Never mind the coin slot. It's broken.
CARRIE: It hurts. my stomach.
COLLINS: ( grabbing her ) Do it! Now.
CARRIE: I can't. I don't know how!
COLLINS: And she looks at Carrie. Her anger seems to seep away. Her voice softens.
COLLINS: Carrie, don't you know.? You don't. I'll show you.
MORTON: Isn't she a bit old for her.
COLLINS: Her first period?
MORTON: Ah, yes.
COLLINS: Morty, until a half hour ago, I don't think she knew there was such a thing.
MORTON: It's hard to believe in this day and age a girl in high school wouldn't know. something. the facts.
COLLINS: Well, knowing that mother of hers.
MORTON: ( cutting her off ) Miss Collins, if you'd been with us longer, you'd understand we cannot interfere with people's beliefs. As for the girls ­
COLLINS: Carrie's always been their scapegoat. So they.
MORTON: You'll have to do something.
COLLINS: I will. But I understood how those girls felt. The whole thing just made me want to take the girl and shake her.
MORTON: It's just her period, for God's sake.
COLLINS: It's just her period, for God's sake.
MORTON: ( cutting in; uncomfortable ) We'll send her home. ( to intercom ) Miss Finch, send in Cassie Wright.
COLLINS: It's Carrie White.
MORTON: ( fiddling with paper clips on his desk )
MORTON: Come in, Cassie.
MORTON: Close the door. No, wait. Miss Finch, bring in a dismissal slip. I think you might take the rest of the day and go home and, uh, well. take care of yourself, Cassie.
CARRIE: ( hardly a murmur )
MORTON: We're all sorry about this incident.
MORTON: ( to Finch, as she goes ) Thank you. ( to Carrie ) Would you like to go to the infirmary?.
MORTON: .lie down for a while.
COLLINS: I think Carrie can go home.
MORTON: Would you like a ride?
MORTON: We could call you a cab.
COLLINS: I'm sure she can walk home. And Carrie, you're excused from gym for a week. Take study hall instead.
MORTON: We are sorry about this, Cassie.
CARRIE: ( sudden fury ) That's not my name!
COLLINS: ( slowly ) That reminds me. A light blew out while I was trying to calm her down.
MORTON: I'll send a janitor to fix it.
46 CARRIE: Concentrating her hatred
49 CARRIE: She walks across the street.
BOBBY: Hey, fart-face! Hey, old praying Carrie!
52 CARRIE: She keeps on walking, ignoring him.
53 BOBBY: Keeping pace with Carrie, shouting across the street.
BOBBY: Fart-face, fart-face, fart-face.
54 CARRIE: Turning toward him, her face contorted with rage.
56 OMITTED: 57 CARRIE
57 CARRIE: CLOSE now, featuring her eyes most prominently. Her face is uncertain, confused. What just happened? She thought ( that's right, thought ) something and it happened. And we HEAR another SCREAM, more of an angry shriek, and then the strange sight and SOUND of:
59 CLOSER: The stones pelting the roof.
60 CARRIE: She is staring across the street at:
61 BOBBY: Screaming with anger ( more than anything else ) as he disentangles himself. He stands up, looks toward Carrie across the street, shakes his little fist.
BOBBY: ( defiantly )
62 CARRIE: The boy's defiant chant can be heard as Carrie blinks, wondering. Then she opens her eyes, wider. She looks at the boy. She frowns for a moment.
BOBBY'S VOICE: Fart-face, fart-face, fart-face!
64 CARRIE: A faint smile, partly of wonder, partly of a strange kind of joy. She knows.
DOORBELL: Eleanor frowns momentarily, leaves the kitchen.
ELEANOR: Oh, Mrs. White.
MARGARET: How have you been, Mrs. Snell?
ELEANOR: And the doctor?
MARGARET: And the doctor?
ELEANOR: And your daughter?
MARGARET: And your daughter?
ELEANOR: Sue is. fine.
ELEANOR: Won't you come in, Mrs. White?
MARGARET: Thank you.
ELEANOR: I think Carrie is in some of Sue's classes.
MARGARET: Perhaps some time Carrie might visit.
ELEANOR: Perhaps some time Carrie might visit.
MARGARET: I'm here on the Lord's work.
ELEANOR: Yes, of course.
MARGARET: These will interest the doctor and you.
ELEANOR: I'm sure they will.
MARGARET: And your daughter.
ELEANOR: ( a smile ) Well, I don't think Sue would be ­
MARGARET: ( cutting in ) Children are godless these days, Mrs. Snell.
ELEANOR: My Sue is a good girl.
MARGARET: These are Godless times.
ELEANOR: I'll drink to that!
ELEANOR: ( continuing; quietly ) We'll all read. these.
ELEANOR: Excuse me. Please sit down.
ELEANOR: Hello. Betty, can I call you back? Margaret White is here. Right. right. Let me get rid of her and I'll call you back.
ELEANOR: We'd like to contribute ten. .twenty dollars.
MARGARET: Thank you. I'll give you a receipt.
ELEANOR: Thank you, Mrs. White.
MARGARET: I'll pray you find Jesus before it's too late.
SUE: That's Carrie White's mother.
SUE: ( apprehensively ) What did she want?
ELEANOR: ( indicating tracts ) She gave us these ­ ( conspiratorial sigh ) .and I gave her a donation.
ELEANOR: ( brightly ) Well, how was school today?
SUE: Today? Like always.
72 CARRIE: Who is sitting in an old Boston rocker by the window in her room which overlooks the street. She is wearing just a slip or perhaps an old terrycloth robe ­ her plain dress and school books on the narrow bed. She is leafing through a teenage magazine on the order of "Seventeen" ­ absorbed in the mundane fantasies of models in their pantyhose and underwear; long gowns and mystery men. An escape of sorts. And we reveal Carrie's bedroom in the low attic of the White house: tiny, plain, severe. It's decorated with just the fewest embellishments ( i.e. high school pennant ) that Margaret would allow in exchange for her own prices ­ a crucifix above Carrie's bed, a small bureau with an equally small mirror, a Bible and plastic glow-in-the-dark Madonna and child, and various religious prints and plaster quotations on the wall.
MARGARET'S VOICE: I know you're listening. Come downstairs.
CARRIE: Hello, Momma.
CARRIE: Who was it that called? What did they say?
78 MARGARET: Point one and some grim satisfaction. Yet she doesn't respond immediately. Then she turns from the stove.
MARGARET: ( softly ) You're a woman now.
CARRIE: Oh Momma, why didn't you tell me something? I was so scared. `And God made Eve from the rib of Adam. And Eve was weak and loosed the raven on the world, and the raven was called Sin ­ `
MARGARET: `And God made Eve from the rib of Adam. And Eve was weak and loosed the raven on the world, and the raven was called Sin ­ `
MARGARET: .and the raven was called sin.
CARRIE: Why didn't you tell me? Oh, Momma ­
MARGARET: ( overriding ) .and the raven was called Sin! .and the first sin was intercourse.
CARRIE: I was so scared! And the other girls, they made fun of me and threw things and ­
CARRIE: Momma, please listen. It wasn't my fault.
CARRIE: And Eve was weak and. say it, woman! Momma, please help me.
MARGARET: And Eve was weak and. say it, woman! Momma, please help me.
CARRIE: Momma, please help me.
MARGARET: And Eve was weak and loosed the raven on the world.
CARRIE: They threw things.
MARGARET: ( overriding ) .and the raven was called Sin. Sin! .and the first sin was intercourse.
CARRIE: Momma, please listen.
MARGARET: And the Lord visited Eve with a curse, and the curse was the Curse of Blood!
CARRIE: You should have told me!
MARGARET: ( heavenward ) O Lord, help this sinning woman see the sin of her days and ways. Show her that if she had remained sinless ­
CARRIE: the Curse of Blood would never have come on her. She may have been tempted by the Antichrist. She may have committed the Sin of Lustful Thoughts.
MARGARET: the Curse of Blood would never have come on her. She may have been tempted by the Antichrist. She may have committed the Sin of Lustful Thoughts.
CARRIE: No, Momma.
MARGARET: Don't you lie to me, Carietta, don't you know by now I can see inside you? I can see your sin just as surely as God can.
CARRIE: Momma, let me go.
MARGARET: We will pray. We will pray, woman, we will pray to Jesus for our woman-weak, wicked, sinning souls.
MARGARET: And the Lord visited Eve with a Curse, and the Curse was the Curse of Blood. And there was a Second Curse, and this was the Curse of Childbearing, and Eve brought forth Cain in sweat and blood!
80 JESUS: Looking down at Carrie.
81 CARRIE: She looks away ­ and inwards. With her, we see:
84 JESUS: Impassive, impersonal, unconcerned ­ or so it seems.
CARRIE: DISSOLVE TO:
TOMMY: She turns away.
TOMMY: Hey, what's the matter?
SUE: What did I do?
TOMMY: What did I do?
SUE: Nothing. It's not you.
TOMMY: Hey, everything's all right. I love you, honey. Did I.?
SUE: ( blurting ) It's Carrie.
TOMMY: Carrie. Carrie White.
SUE: Carrie. Carrie White.
TOMMY: Praying Carrie?
SUE: ( sharply ) Don't call her that.
TOMMY: ( imitating Carrie ) It's. beautiful. ( laughing ) That's what she said when I read that poem you wrote for me.
SUE: Tommy, please.
TOMMY: ( going on ) And Big Belly Fromm saying. ( imitating ) That isn't exactly criticism, Miss White. ( exploding )
TOMMY: Hey, honey, it was a beautiful poem. I wish I could have written it.
SUE: Don't call me that.
TOMMY: Don't call her that. Don't call me that. What the hell's the matter with you?
TOMMY: Hey, are you crying? Are you?
TOMMY: Jesus, Sue, what is it?
SUE: ( trying to turn away ) I told you.
TOMMY: Told me what?
SUE: About Carrie.
TOMMY: That thing in the shower? Hey, it was a joke, wasn't it? I mean, everyone was doing it.
SUE: I'm not everyone.
TOMMY: You're special.
SUE: I was one of them.
TOMMY: So you were teasing Carrie White ­
SUE: knees and say grace in the cafeteria. alone, for Christ's sake. And the way she dresses. Hey, Sue, she's asking for it.
TOMMY: knees and say grace in the cafeteria. alone, for Christ's sake. And the way she dresses. Hey, Sue, she's asking for it.
SUE: ( vehemently ) How would you like to be Carrie White?
TOMMY: Carrie White instead of being Tommy Ross. big man, big jock, popular.
SUE: Carrie White instead of being Tommy Ross. big man, big jock, popular.
TOMMY: and find myself working at my dad's car lot and out Friday nights and Saturdays at Uncle Billy's or the Cavalier drinking beer and maybe married with a bunch of kids. What's that got to do with Carrie White? Or anything?
SUE: ( interrupting ) I've got to do something about it.
TOMMY: ( interrupting ) I've got to do something about it.
SUE: ( interrupting ) I've got to do something about it.
TOMMY: That's not enough. That's like something my mom would do.
SUE: That's not enough. That's like something my mom would do.
TOMMY: That's not enough. That's like something my mom would do.
SUE: That's not enough. That's like something my mom would do.
TOMMY: What are you going to do? Kiss her, for God's sake?
SUE: God, I hate you sometimes!
TOMMY: What the hell do you want me to do?
SUE: I want you to help me. Or are you just interested in fucking me?
TOMMY: ( angrily ) Don't say that!
SUE: Fucking me, fucking me.
TOMMY: Cut it out!
SUE: Then help me!
TOMMY: Okay, what can I do?
SUE: I want you to think about Carrie White.
TOMMY: ( incredulously ) You want me to sit here and think about. Jesus! ( moment ) Are you serious? ( moment ) You're serious. ( moment ) What's there to think about?
SUE: Think about it.
TOMMY: He stares off through the windshield. He is really puzzled. He steals a look at Sue. He starts to put his arm around her; she moves a little, subtly but clearly. Tommy stares off into space Sue glances toward him. Of course she knows. And he is beginning to understand. Tommy looks straight ahead again. He is starting to think. It's not all that easy.
TOMMY: I never thought about her. I mean, she wasn't someone you had to think about. She was always there ­ keeping to herself in that stupid dress ­ that weird mother. You know what I mean?
TOMMY: ( almost under his breath ) Carrie White?
92 CARRIE: She is standing in the entrance of the living room. Her demeanor seems more peaceful, calm, almost too calm.
93 MARGARET: A touch of fear in her eyes. But:
MARGARET: Go to bed.
94 CARRIE: She crosses over to her mother, kisses her lightly on the ( unmoving ) head.
CARRIE: Good night, Momma.
MARGARET: Carrie! Carrie? Carrie!
MARGARET: Carrie! Carrie, open this door!
CARRIE'S VOICE: ( sweetly ) It's open, Momma.
MARGARET: What was that noise?
CARRIE: Nothing, Momma.
MARGARET: Go to bed.
101 COLLINS: Walks in front of them with a clipboard taking roll. 102 THE GIRLS STILL TRACKING, FEATURING Sue
COLLINS: 102 THE GIRLS
SUE: COLLINS ( o.s. )
WATSON: The CAMERA COMES to an empty space ­ without being told, we can tell it's Carrie's.
103 COLLINS: Hesitates, then moves right along.
COLLINS: .and the Wilsons.
CORA: .Miss Collins.
RHONDA: .Miss Collins.
COLLINS: ( small smile; then, closing her book ) Okay. Sit down.
COLLINS: You too, Chris. And spit out that gum.
CHRIS: ( overly sweet ) Where'll I put it, Miss Collins?
COLLINS: You can choke on it for all I care. Now sit down.
104 CHRIS: Pausing for a second, then deciding it's better to go along without talking back. She sits 105 THE GIRLS Shifting nervously, unused to Collins' absolute no-nonsense tone.
106 COLLINS: Taking a deep breath.
COLLINS: Okay. I just want you all to know that you did a shitty thing yesterday. A really shitty thing.
108 COLLINS: Glaring at Helen, silencing her.
COLLINS: Did any of you stop to think that Carrie White has feelings? Do any of you ever stop to think? No, I guess you've got your minds on your dates and the Prom. Chris, I imagine you can take your pick, who's the lucky guy?
CHRIS: ( mumbling ) Billy Nolan.
COLLINS: ( loudly ) Who? Speak up! I can't hear you.
CHRIS: Billy Nolan
COLLINS: Well, isn't he the lucky one.
COLLINS: And what about you, Sue? Who's taking you?
SUE: Tommy Ross.
COLLINS: ( beat; then ) Okay. Now my idea for this little trick you pulled was three days' suspension and refusal of your prom tickets.
COLLINS: That would hit you where you live, now, wouldn't it? And you'd deserve it ­ I don't think any of you have any idea of just how nasty what you did was. The office has decided that you're to have one week's detention.
COLLINS: But. There's one little catch. It's to be my detention. Right here in the gym. Fifty minutes every day. Get the picture?
112 CHRIS: Furious, defiant.
CHRIS: I won't come.
113 COLLINS: No less determined, but cool.
COLLINS: That's up to you, Chris. That's up to all of you. Punishment for skipping detention is three days' suspension and the loss of your prom tickets. Any other thoughts?
COLLINS: Right. Now change up.
121A CARRIE: Her face ­ curious, deciding to follow it up.
CHRIS: She can't get away with this. I'm going to get her. That goddamn snerd ­
SUE: Let it go, Chris.
COLLINS: The period's not up, Hargensen.
CHRIS: It is for me.
COLLINS: There are ten minutes left.
CHRIS: Stick them up your ass.
CHRIS: You can't hit us! You'll get canned for this, you bitch! My father ­
COLLINS: One more word from you and I'll throw you across the room. Want to see if I'm telling the truth?
CHRIS: She can't get away with this! Goddammit! If we all stick together, we can ­
CHRIS: Norma. Helen. Sue!
SUE: ( lifeless ) Shut up, Chris. Just shut up.
127 CHRIS: A mutineer without a single ally now. She realizes it and heads for the door leading to the locker room, and this time, Collins doesn't even try to stop her. At the door:
CHRIS: This isn't over. This isn't over by a long shot.
CHRIS: Hey, Sue! Just who I've been looking for!
CHRIS: ( continuing ) I wanted you to sign my yearbook. Hey, where's you old man, did he stand you up?
SUE: ( busying herself with the yearbook ) Still at practice
CHRIS: Well, I guess you've heard I'm out of the prom. I bet that cocksucker Morton loses his job, though. Daddy's suing them. Hey, Billee! Billee! Come over and say hi to Sue.
CHRIS: ( continuing ) Hey, is that it? Just Sue Snell?
BILLY: Hey, Suze.
CHRIS: I think we're going anyway, right, Billee?
BILLY: Sure thing, Charlie.
SUE: You mean crash?
CHRIS: Sure, why not? Hey, listen, I've got a good one. "Roses are red, violets are blue, sugar is sweet, but Carrie White eats shit."
SUE: Chris, I've got to go.
SHAME.": ( oblivious, her laughter turning to fury ) That goddamn Carrie! If only the rest of you had walked out with me. Jesus, Sue, why didn't you?
CHRIS: ( oblivious, her laughter turning to fury ) That goddamn Carrie! If only the rest of you had walked out with me. Jesus, Sue, why didn't you?
SUE: I took the detention because I thought we ­ I ­ earned it. It was a shitty thing to have done. End of statement.
CHRIS: Bullshit! That goddamn snerd and her batshit mother ­ saying we're all going to hell.
SUE: ( rising ) What'd she ever do to you, Chris? Or to any of us? Why do you hate her so much?
CHRIS: Hey, hey. tell me if I'm wrong, but who was that n there pitching with the rest of us?
SUE: ( it comes out a pinched nerve ) Me. But I stopped.
CHRIS: ( dawning on her; getting it finally ) Oh. Oh, aren't you just it? Oh, my, yes. ( imitating; prissy ) You stopped. Hey, Billee, she stopped.
CHRIS: ( continuing ) God, I'm dumb sometimes. Billee, hey, Billee, do you want to know why Suze here didn't walk out?
SUE: I'll see you around, Chris.
CHRIS: No. Wait. You stopped, remember? So just stop again. Why didn't you walk out? Why didn't you walk out, Sue?
SUE: Okay, Chris. That's enough.
CHRIS: You didn't walk out, Sue. little Suze. little Suzy Creamcheese. because you didn't want to miss a moment of your precious prom. And you don't?
SUE: And you don't?
CHRIS: ( not about to be put off ) You're goddamn right, I don't. But we're on your case now. ( beat ) I'll bet you've got your dress all picked out, too. What color is it? Yellowguts? ( continuing ) ( dismissively ) See you around, Sue.
CHRIS: ( continuing ) ( dismissively ) See you around, Sue.
TOMMY: I want to talk to you.
SUE: I want to talk to you.
TOMMY: Sure, what's up?
SUE: If I asked you to do something for me ­ something special ­ would you?
TOMMY: ( nodding ) No matter how crazy it sounded?
SUE: No matter how crazy it sounded?
TOMMY: Sure. What?
TOMMY: ( continuing; exploding ) Are you out of your mind?
CHRIS: Goddamnit, Billy!
CHRIS: ( continuing ) Slow down! ( as he pays no heed ) Slow down, you stupid shit!
BILLY: Scared, Chuckie?
CHRIS: No. You'll kill us, you stupid shit!
BILLY: Don't call me that.
CHRIS: Stupid shit.
CHRIS: ( continuing; under her breath ) Stupid shit.
BILLY: ( disgustedly ) Oh wow!
BILLY: What's wrong?
CHRIS: Can't you wait a minute?
BILLY: What for?
CHRIS: You're so ignorant.
BILLY: That's what you like.
CHRIS: No? I'll show you what you like, Chuckie.
BILLY: No? I'll show you what you like, Chuckie.
CHRIS: She pushes him away. He grabs her. She pushes; he grabs. A struggle. Grabs at her tit. There goes the blouse; the buttons are ripped off.
BILLY: She pushes him away. He grabs her. She pushes; he grabs. A struggle. Grabs at her tit. There goes the blouse; the buttons are ripped off.
CHRIS: She pushes him away. He grabs her. She pushes; he grabs. A struggle. Grabs at her tit. There goes the blouse; the buttons are ripped off.
BILLY: .How you. gonna. explain that.
CHRIS: Dumb shit!
BILLY: What'd I tell you?
BILLY: ( continuing ) Hell is this?
CHRIS: I want you to do something.
BILLY|: ( eagerly ) Yeah, what?
CHRIS: I want you to do something for me. Something important.
BILLY: ( warily ) Something important?
CHRIS: It will be very important to me. It will make me feel very good if you do it.
CHRIS: ( continuing ) Billy, I hate Carrie White.
TOMMY: Okay. I'll do it.
MARGARET: ( low ) Carrie, did you pray?
TOMMY'S VOICE: She stares at him and quickly covers the binding of the book with her hand, covering the title. He looks as startled as she does.
CARRIE: She stares at him and quickly covers the binding of the book with her hand, covering the title. He looks as startled as she does.
TOMMY: How're you doing?
CARRIE: ( after a beat; almost inaudibly )
TOMMY: I thought you had gym this period.
TOMMY: ( continuing ) What're you reading?
CARRIE: ( trying to cover, and not very well ) It's about. um.. sewing.
TOMMY: Umm. if you don't have a date for the Prom, would you want to go with me?
CARRIE: The Prom.
TOMMY: The Prom.
TOMMY: ( continuing ) .It's next Friday, and I know this is later notice, but they stop selling tickets soon, and ­
CARRIE: I don't like to be tricked.
TOMMY: But it's too late ­ she's gone, already out the door.
GEORGE: Hey, Ross!
TOMMY: Hey, Carrie! Wait!
TOMMY: ( continuing ) Hey, it's no big deal.
CARRIE: Do you people think you can just go on tricking me forever?
TOMMY: But it's too little, and too late. She's crying. And what's more, she's gone ­ swallowed up into the clamor of students rushing to beat the bell. Which RINGS as we:
COLLINS: ( on no response ) Carrie, what's the matter? ( on still no response ) Was it one of the girls? Did one of the girls do something to you? Do you want a Kleenex?
CARRIE: It's all right. Just tell me, there's nothing to be afraid of.
COLLINS: It's all right. Just tell me, there's nothing to be afraid of.
CARRIE: Miss Collins.
COLLINS: That's it.
CARRIE: When can I come back to gym?
COLLINS: Not until Monday. Now what is it? Are you going to tell me? Come on, Carrie, tell me.
CARRIE: I got asked to the prom.
COLLINS: That's great!
CARRIE: Tommy Ross asked me.
COLLINS: Tommy Ross ­ that's wonderful. He's cute.
CARRIE: I know who he goes around with. They're trying to trick me again. I know.
COLLINS: Maybe he really meant it. I mean, maybe he really did mean it. Maybe you should think about it. It might be really fun. You might have a really good time!
CARRIE: It would be a nightmare.
COLLINS: C'mon, Carrie. You should have a better image of yourself. You just think you're unattractive, but look at your hair. It's really beautiful. If you just fixed it up a little. here, I'll show you.
143 OMIT: 144 INT. FACULTY LOUNGE ­ DAY
COLLINS: Carrie's been asked to the prom.
MORTON: Carrie White.
COLLINS: Carrie White.
MORTON: By whom? The Beak?
COLLINS: By Tommy Ross.
MORTON: What about his girlfriend? Doesn't he date the little Snell girl?
COLLINS: I think she put him up to it.
COLLINS: Who's brainstorm was this? What are you trying to do?
SUE: You've got it wrong.
COLLINS: I hope so. I wouldn't have expected this from you, Sue. Not any of it. Well?
SUE: What do you want to know?
COLLINS: Why Tommy asked her to the prom. I asked him to.
SUE: ( reluctant; able to go this far ) I asked him to.
COLLINS: ( swallowing ) I asked him to.
SUE: ( swallowing ) I asked him to.
COLLINS: But, in God's name, what for? What could you possibly have in mind?
SUE: You mean what good would it do? Maybe it'll. bring her out of. make her a.
COLLINS: A part of things? Oh, come on, Sue. None of us are that stupid. And neither is Carrie.
SUE: Maybe not.
COLLINS: And you're not going to go? You're going to stay home and miss your senior prom?
COLLINS: ( continuing ) Yes, Norma? What is it?
NORMA: Just the attendance sheets, Miss Collins.
COLLINS: Just leave them on the desk. You understand, you can't come without a date?
COLLINS: ( continuing ) Is there something else, Norma?
NORMA: ( butter could melt ) No, Miss Collins.
COLLINS: ( to Tommy ) Which brings us to you.
TOMMY: Mr. Morton's office?
COLLINS: Mr. Morton's office?
TOMMY: Mr. Morton's office?
COLLINS: Mr. Morton's office?
TOMMY: ( bluffed; then off-handedly ­ like we first saw him in Fromm's class ) What's the big deal?
COLLINS: ( to Collins ) You can't order anyone not to take someone to the prom.
TOMMY: ( to Collins ) You can't order anyone not to take someone to the prom.
SUE: ( to Collins ) You can't order anyone not to take someone to the prom.
TOMMY: ( to Collins ) You can't order anyone not to take someone to the prom.
COLLINS: ( to Collins ) You can't order anyone not to take someone to the prom.
TOMMY: ( to Collins ) You can't order anyone not to take someone to the prom.
SUE: ( to Collins ) You can't order anyone not to take someone to the prom.
COLLINS: I can make sure you don't hurt Carrie.
SUE: We're not trying to hurt her. We're trying to help her.
COLLINS: ( continuing ) Tommy, when you come to the prom with Carrie White, don't you think you'll look a little ridiculous?
COLLINS: ( continuing ) Tommy, when you come to the prom with Carrie White, don't you think you'll look a little ridiculous?
TOMMY: We don't care how we look.
SUE: We don't care how we look.
SUE: ( continuing ) Do we?
TOMMY: So this is where you live.
CARRIE: What. what're you doing here?
TOMMY: ( laughs ) Aren't you going to ask me in?
TOMMY: ( continuing ) Why not?
CARRIE: Momma's resting. What do you want?
TOMMY: Right to the point, huh? Okay, about the prom.
CARRIE: I already told you.
TOMMY: ( a little charm ) Nothing to stop you changing your mind. Girls do it all the time.
CARRIE: Why are you doing this?
TOMMY: Hey, I'm asking you because I want to.
CARRIE: Look, I don't do anything I don't want to.
TOMMY: Look, I don't do anything I don't want to.
CARRIE: I can't.
TOMMY: Sure you can.
CARRIE: You better go.
MARGARET'S VOICE: Carrie! Who are you talking to?
TOMMY: Don't you think you better answer?
CARRIE: No one, Momma.
TOMMY: You're going with me.
CARRIE: I can't.
TOMMY: You're going.
CARRIE: They'll laugh.
TOMMY: No one will laugh. We'll see to it.
CARRIE: Please. Please go.
TOMMY: Not `til you say yes.
CARRIE: Why? Why is it so important to you?
TOMMY: I don't know. Maybe it's because you liked my poem.
CARRIE: ( beat ) I'll pick you up at eight.
TOMMY: I'll pick you up at eight.
CARRIE: ( whispering ) ( then ) Thank you.
149 CARRIE: Watching him. She takes the hand he "touched" and brushes the hair back from her face. A little beautiful? You bet.
MARGARET'S VOICE: Carrie? Did you hear me?
CARRIE: Coming, Momma. Coming.
SUE: Why not?
HELEN: Why did you do it? God, everyone's talking.
SUE: I asked Tommy to take Carrie. I thought I owed her that much.
HELEN: Where does that put the rest of us?
SUE: You have to make up your own mind.
HELEN: And Tommy went along with it?
SUE: ( pauses ) I guess the other kids think I'm stuck-up.
HELEN: Well. they're all talking about it. But most of them still think you're okay.
HELEN: There is. .a small dissenting faction.
SUE: I guess she's having a field day with this.
HELEN: Susie, she hates your guts.
MARGARET: You haven't touched your pie, Carrie.
CARRIE: It makes me have pimples, Momma.
MARGARET: Your pimples are the Lord's way of chastising you.
CARRIE: Momma, please see that I have to start to get. to try and get along with people.
MARGARET: Momma, please see that I have to start to get. to try and get along with people.
CARRIE: Momma, please see that I have to start to get. to try and get along with people.
MARGARET: Whatever are you going on about? Have you been showering with the other girls again?
CARRIE: I. I've been invited to the prom.
MARGARET: ( a foreign language ) It's next Friday, and ­
CARRIE: It's next Friday, and ­
MARGARET: It's that teacher, the one that called. She'll be sorry.
CARRIE: Momma, please see that I'm not like you. I'm funny, I mean, the kids think I'm funny. I don't want to be. I want to try and be a whole person before it's too late to ­
CARRIE: ( continuing ) His name is Tommy Ross, and he's a very nice boy. He's ­
MARGARET: promised to stop in and meet you before, and ­
CARRIE: promised to stop in and meet you before, and ­
MARGARET: ( overlapping ) I said no!
CARRIE: have me in by midnight. I've ­
MARGARET: ( shaking her head now; uncontrollable ) No, no, no ­
CARRIE: Margaret's shaking with fury, trembling. Carrie wipes the stringy wet hair from her forehead.
CARRIE: ( continuing ) I've accepted, Momma. I have accepted.
MARGARET: The closet.
CARRIE: After all you've been taught ­
MARGARET: After all you've been taught ­
CARRIE: Everyone isn't bad, Momma, everything isn't sinful.
MARGARET: Go to your closet and pray. Ask to be forgiven!
CARRIE: You'll like this boy, he..
MARGARET: Boys. Yes, boys come next. After the blood, the boys come. Like sniffing dogs.
CARRIE: Momma ­
MARGARET: .grinning and slobbering, trying to find out where the smell comes from, where the smell is. That. smell!
CARRIE: Please stop.
MARGARET: Yes, in cars. Yes. I know where they take you in their cars. Roadhouses. Music. Whiskey. I've seen it, all right. Oh, yes.
CARRIE: Momma, you better stop.
MARGARET: You're not going.
CARRIE: I've already said I would, Momma.
MARGARET: Then say no. Say no. Or we'll move.
CARRIE: We'll move from here and you'll never see that boy again.
MARGARET: We'll move from here and you'll never see that boy again.
MARGARET: ( continuing ) The rain's coming in.
CARRIE: Momma, sit down.
MARGARET: I'm going to close the windows.
CARRIE: I'll get them. Please sit and talk to me.
MARGARET: Margaret continues toward the kitchen window to close it. Carrie knits her brow, and flex, the window closes. Margaret whips around, facing Carrie.
CARRIE: I'm going, Momma. And things are going to change around here.
MARGARET: Another window.
MARGARET: ( continuing ) It's Satan's power. First he entered your father, carried him off.
CARRIE: He ran away, Momma. Everyone knows that.
MARGARET: The devil tempted him.
CARRIE: He ran away with a woman, Momma.
MARGARET: All men are the same. That boy, he's like all the rest, he doesn't ­
CARRIE: I don't care. He asked me to go. And I'm going. I'm going, Momma. You can't stop me.
HOLD ­: SLOW DISSOLVE TO: 155 & 156 OMITTED 157 EXT. ROAD ­ NIGHT Leading to Henty's farm. A slight drizzle; or, the ground is still wet. A little more than a crescent moon silhouettes a group of five: Billy and Chris in front, and Billy's twitchy zoo ­ a completely wrecked KENNY GARSON, a very nervous FREDDY DE LOIS, and an occasionally giggling, goggled HENRY TRENNANT ­ trailing behind. De Lois is swinging a nine-pound sledge-hammer in the air; the other two goons are struggling with an ice-chest and steel pails. Henty's farmhouse and barn are in the distance.
DE LOIS: Hell of a risk for a joke.
BILLY: You want out?
DE LOIS: ( hastily ) No, uh-uh. ( then ) It's a good joke, Billy.
DE LOIS: ( continuing ) Hey, piggie.
DE LOIS: ( continuing ) You sure Old Man Henty won't be around?
CHRIS: I told you. He's at a funeral.
BILLY: Shut up, Henry.
DE LOIS: Whose funeral did he go to?
BILLY: His mother's.
DE LOIS: His mother's? Jesus Christ, she musta been older than God!
DE LOIS: ( continuing ) The bastard is going to shit where he stands when he comes back and gets a look.
BILLY: The sound of Trennant's high-pitched giggle.
THE BOYS: Soo-ee, soo-ee Soo-ee, soo-ee
DE LOIS: Doan worry, piggies, doan worry. I'm gonna bash your fuckin' heads in, and you woan have to worry `bout the bomb no more.
BILLY: Shut up and do it already.
DE LOIS: I will, I will. I'm not gonna give `em time to burp.
BILLY: The throat.
DE LOIS: I. can't.
CHRIS: Do it, Billy.
CHRIS: ( continuing ) Do it quick.
BLACK: FADE IN: 160 EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE ­ AFTERNOON
MARGARET: Red. I might have known it would be red.
CARRIE: ( softly ) Only clearing the thread, Momma.
MARGARET: ( abruptly ) It's Satan.
CARRIE: ( wearily; pitying ) Oh, momma.
MARGARET: He has given you a power.
CARRIE: Momma, it doesn't have anything to do with Satan. It's me. If I concentrate hard enough, I can make things move.
MARGARET: Satan is clever.
CARRIE: Momma, there are other people. people with the power. It's a part of me.
MARGARET: If it were, I'd know it.
CARRIE: If it were, I'd know it.
MARGARET: You poor child. He doesn't let you know he's working through you.
CARRIE: Momma, I'd know.
MARGARET: You are to renounce this power. You must give it up. You must never use it.
CARRIE: I'm going to do my homework, Momma.
MARGARET: There's going to be a judgement!
162 WINDOW: Being jimmied open. Behind the thick glass, we see a face ­ just whose isn't clear yet. The slip-lock comes free, the sill is being pushed up, and Billy's head appears. Chris is right behind him.
168 BILLY: As he disappears behind a short draw curtain which obscures the girders over the stage.
169 CHRIS: unable to see him, suddenly feeling very alone.
CHRIS: What's it like up there?
BILLY: You stupid shit.
CHRIS: You stupid shit.
BILLY: ( still in good humor ) Nice talk.
CHRIS: Hurry up. Do you hear me, just hurry up.
BILLY: ( blackface ) Yes'um. Yes'um. Weeze doing the best we can.
CHRIS: I want to go home.
BILLY: Just keep your tits on and I'll let you pull it when the time comes.
CHRIS: I plan to.
CARRIE: Come in, Momma.
CARRIE: Do you want to pin it on, Momma?
MARGARET: I can see your dirtypillows. Everyone will.
CARRIE: Breasts, Momma, breasts. Every woman has them.
MARGARET: Take off that dress.
CARRIE: We'll burn it together, we'll pray for forgiveness.
MARGARET: We'll burn it together, we'll pray for forgiveness.
CARRIE: No, Momma.
MARGARET: He's not coming.
CARRIE: Stop it, Momma. I'm nervous enough.
CARRIE: Stop hurting yourself, Momma. That's not going to stop me either.
CARRIE: Go away, Momma.
MARGARET: You know I'm right. He'll laugh at you. They'll all laugh at you.
CARRIE: No. It'll be okay.
MARGARET: It's not too late. You can stay here with me.
CARRIE: I'll answer the door and say you're sick, I'll say ­
MARGARET: I'll answer the door and say you're sick, I'll say ­
CARRIE: Momma, sit on the bed.
MARGARET: I'll say that you changed your mind, I'll say ­
MARGARET: `Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.'
CARRIE: You'll say nothing, Momma. You are going to have to learn that I'm not like you, not anymore.
173 CARRIE: She goes back to the bed and picks up her wrap; then, to Margaret:
CARRIE: I'll be home early, Momma.
MARGARET: There's going to be a judgement!
CARRIE: Momma, you will be quiet until I'm gone. I love you, Momma.
TOMMY: Carrie takes his hand.
179 MARGARET: at the window of Carrie's room.
CARRIE: It's like a dream.
TOMMY: You can still change your mind, you know.
CARRIE: Easier said than done.
TOMMY: ( grinning ) No. Please ­ not yet.
CARRIE: No. Please ­ not yet.
TOMMY: ( beat ) Can we sit here another minute?
CARRIE: ( beat ) Can we sit here another minute?
CARRIE: ( and then out it comes ) Maybe. maybe this was a mistake.
TOMMY: Hey, it won't be so bad.
TOMMY: Really, I mean it. They're okay, you'll see. Don't be nervous. Besides. I'd look awfully silly dancing by myself.
VOICE: Hey, Ross. Gawd, you look queer.
TOMMY: When did you come out of the treetops, Bomba?
GEORGE: Ross, if I'd known you were going to look this good, I'd have asked you instead of Frieda.
FRIEDA: Don't let it bother you. If they destroy each other, I'll dance with you.
FRIEDA: Hey, where'd you buy your dress? I love it.
CARRIE: ( shyly ) I made it.
FRIEDA: ( unaffected surprise ) Made it? No shit.
CARRIE: No shit.
FRIEDA: The mural's nice.
CARRIE: ( confiding ) I'm really nervous.
FRIEDA: S'okay. We're sitting together.
NORMA: ( looking her up and down ) That's a lovely dress, Carrie. Wherever did you get it?
CARRIE: I made it.
NORMA: Well, of course you did. I can't get over it, you look so different. You're positively glowing. What's your secret?
CARRIE: I'm Don MacLean's secret lover.
NORMA: ( a half-beat late, getting it, tittering ) Don MacLean's secret. How funny you are. ( cutting her ) Why, hello Tommy. Aren't you excited?
TOMMY: Cold sweat is running down my thighs in rivers.
NORMA: ( smile slipping a full notch now ) Well, I have to hurry back. Stan'll think I got lost.
GEORGE: ( King Kong; right on top of her ) And, Frieda, don't you look nice.
NORMA: ( tittering, moving away smack into Frieda ) And, Frieda, don't you look nice.
FRIEDA: ( toothpaste smile ) Get douched, Norma.
188 MONTAGE: As the prom gets underway:
GEORGE: He grabs Frieda, and they make their way out onto the dance floor, Frieda shrugging helplessly at Carrie.
CARRIE: They're nice. George is funny.
TOMMY: He's a good guy. See, didn't I tell you? Sure you don't want to dance?
CARRIE: Could we just sit here for a minute?
VOICE: Carrie turns around and finds herself facing Collins ­ dressed up, looking more like one of the students than a teacher.
CARRIE: You look very pretty, Miss Collins.
COLLINS: Thank you You too. Beautiful.
CARRIE: It's awfully nice of you to say so. I know I'm not. not really. but thank you anyway.
TOMMY: `scuse me. Be right back, okay?
COLLINS: ( gesturing to his seat )
COLLINS: Carrie, anything that happened before. well, it's all forgotten. I want you to know that.
CARRIE: I can't forget it. But it's over with. It's over.
COLLINS: I remember my own prom. I was two inches taller than the boy I went with when I was in my heels. He gave me a corsage that clashed with my gown. But it was magic. I don't know why. But I've never had a date like it, ever since. Is it like that for you?
CARRIE: It's very. nice.
COLLINS: ( smiling ) Just nice?
CARRIE: No. There's more. I don't know. .it's like being on Mars.
COLLINS: You'll never forget it.
CARRIE: I think you're right.
CARRIE: Thank you.
COLLINS: Have a lovely time, Carrie.
TOMMY: ( to Collins ) What are you doing with my date?
COLLINS: Girl secrets.
TOMMY: Don't let me catch you hugging any guys.
CARRIE: You won't.
TOMMY: Better not. Hey, listen, do you really have to be back so early?
CARRIE: I promised.
TOMMY: Okay. I understand.
CARRIE: I'm sorry.
TOMMY: No, it's okay. Listen, the other kids are going over to Lewiston after the Prom ­
CARRIE: ( breaking in ) That's okay.
TOMMY: What is?
CARRIE: You want to go with your friends. I don't want to spoil anything.
TOMMY: Hey, let me finish. What I was going to say, I mean if it'd be alright with you, what do you say we go to the Cavalier?
CARRIE: ( surprised; she'd love to ) I've never been there.
TOMMY: Hey, great. We'll have the place all to ourselves. Great! Then it's settled.
CARRIE: ( holding back ) I don't. I can't. I.
TOMMY: I don't. I can't. I.
CARRIE: I don't. I can't. I.
TOMMY: You can.
TOMMY: I'm sorry.
CARRIE: I'm sorry.
TOMMY: It's just.
CARRIE: It's just.
TOMMY: No harm, no foul.
CARRIE: I don't know. anything. I can't dance.
TOMMY: You danced.
CARRIE: I don't even know how to.
TOMMY: It's easy.
CARRIE: Tommy. why?
TOMMY: Why what?
CARRIE: Why am I here?
TOMMY: It's the prom.
CARRIE: With you.
TOMMY: Because I asked you. And.
CARRIE: Why? Why did you?
TOMMY: Because I wanted to.
CARRIE: He pauses; he's on the edge. And steps back.
TOMMY: He pauses; he's on the edge. And steps back.
TOMMY: .you liked my poem. Only I didn't write it. Someone else did.
CARRIE: She's puzzled. And she's about to ask something else.
TOMMY: ( quickly ) Look, Carrie, we're here, we're together. and I like it, you know. I mean, I.
CARRIE: A commotion from the floor. Tommy turns.
TOMMY: Hey, look!
CARRIE: ( uneasily ) It's a fairy tale.
TOMMY: ( beaming; taking her arm )
ERNEST: All right, ladies and gentlemen. Take your seats, please ­ it's time for the voting.
NORMA: This contest is an insult to women!
GEORGE: It insults men, too!
ERNEST: ( over the noise ) Please take your seats. It's time to vote for the King and Queen.
CARRIE: ( looking up to see him smiling at her ) .we're on here!
TOMMY: I know. Want to decline?
CARRIE: Do you want to?
TOMMY: Hell, no. If you win, all you do is sit up there for the school song and one dance. And they put your picture in the yearbook so everyone can see we looked like idiots. Besides, it's the last year.
CARRIE: They're beautiful.
TOMMY: You're beautiful.
CARRIE: Who do we vote for? They're more your crowd than mine.
TOMMY: Whatever you like.
CARRIE: In fact, I don't really have a crowd.
TOMMY: Let's vote for ourselves. To the devil with false modesty.
TOMMY: Hurt yourself?
CARRIE: ( trying to smile ) But I broke it and it was a souvenir.
TOMMY: There's still your boat. Toot, toot.
TOMMY: Hey, hey.
CARRIE: Don't know your own strength. Whew.
TOMMY: Don't know your own strength. Whew.
TOMMY: Hey, it's okay.
ERNEST: We've sort of hit a snag. Mr. Morton says this is the first time in the history of the Spring Prom that ­
VOICE: How far does he go back? 1800?
ERNEST: We've got a tie.
GEORGE: Polka-dot or striped?
ERNEST: Sixty-three votes for Frank Grier and Cora Wilson, and sixty-three votes for Tommy Ross and Carrie White.
201 TOMMY: Watching her intently, his mouth slightly open.
ERNEST: Attention! If I could have your attention, please.
204 CARRIE: Slowly looking up, seeing Tommy.
CARRIE: They're not applauding for us. It can't be for us.
TOMMY: Maybe it's for you.
BILLY: I thought you said they'd win.
CHRIS: They will. They will. Won't even be close.
BILLY: If you screwed up.
CHRIS: Don't worry. I called in a few favors.
NORMA: Good luck!
CARRIE: Don't vote for us.
TOMMY: Don't vote for us.
CARRIE: Don't vote for us.
TOMMY: In for a penny, in for a pound. That's what my grandmother used to say.
CARRIE: ( swallowing ) Don't. Please.
TOMMY: For you.
TOMMY: Tonight you go first-class.
211 NORMA: At the voting table, she spies Sue coming in, and finding it irresistible, blurts out the news, whispering to:
212 MORTON: Who's just finishing the ballot counting. He looks in the direction that Norma's pointing in, 213 SUE Going backstage, heading into the wings to watch:
213 SUE: Going backstage, heading into the wings to watch:
ERNEST: Tommy and Carrie win. By one vote.
216 MORTON: Blocked by the clamor of the students, he's unable to make a straight bee-line for Sue in the wings. So he takes the long way around ­ back behind the stage.
222 ERNEST: the showman now, P.T. Barnum in all of his expansiveness.
223 SUE: In the wings, watching this action. In the corner of the FRAME, the cord we glimpsed earlier ­ the same one which Chris clutched beneath the stage ­ jiggles, and Sue notices it move. She traces its path with her eyes, seeing that it goes up to:
225 CARRIE: Staring down at the gym floor; the lights are searing ­ so hot and bright that it's impossible to see clearly, and a new set of spotlights being shone on Tommy and her only makes it harder.
228 ERNEST: spreading his arms; a politician.
ERNEST: Ladies and gentlemen, I give you he King and Queen of the Spring Prom ­ TOMMY ROSS AND CARRIE WHITE!
MORTON: What're you doing here, young lady?
SUE: ( trying to head for cord under stage ) Something's wrong! We'll raise your banner to the skyyyyh.
MORTON: I'll say there is.
BILLY: What's the matter with you? Pull it!
233 CARRIE: Confused, wondering what's happening in the glare of lights and noise.
BILLY: ( leering ) It can stay there until hell freezes over, Chuckie.
239 CLOSER: The blood splashing down.
CHRIS: ( panicky ) ( nervous too, hissing ) Shut up!
BILLY: ( nervous too, hissing ) Shut up!
246 CARRIE: Her eyes tightly clenched shut, looking as if she's been dipped in a bucket of red paint. She's gotten the worst of it.
248 TOMMY: Splattered with blood. Below them, the sounds of hysteria begin ( "My God, that's blood!" ) Tommy starts toward Carrie just as:
252 CARRIE: as she starts toward the unconscious Tommy.
254 CARRIE: hearing the dreaded laughter.
257 CARRIE: Putting her hands to her blood-covered face, slowly getting to her feet.
COLLINS: Oh, Carrie ­ let me help you.
COLLINS: ( to Morton ) Call the police!
261 CARRIE: Tears streaming down her face, the blood streaking, as she takes in the sight of her 262 THE GYM ­ YET ANOTHER ANGLE Helen Shyres is still laughing so hard that she's about to throw up or go into shock. George Dawson has climbed on the stage and is hunched over the slumped figure of Tommy Ross, examining him.
GEORGE: Call a doctor! Hey, call a doctor, quick!
264 CARRIE: Takes a deep breath, mustering her energy. She closes her eyes and sees:
266 CARRIE: Closes her eyes even tighter and flexes. And ­ in SWISH PANS:
THE BEAK: It's Carrie! It's Carrie!
271 CARRIE: A small smile at being recognized by the Beak as the one responsible, the one with the power now. It's not what she wanted, but it no longer matters. They're going to know her now and never forget her.
273 CARRIE: Seeing the hose, getting the idea. NOTE: SPLIT SCREENS begin here.
274 CLOSER: as her eyes narrow and focus on the hose, zeroing on it.
279 CARRIE: Eyes gleaming, a glimmer of triumph as she concentrates and surveys ­
281 CARRIE: A smile of satisfaction. For the first time, she's showing them ­ they're the ones being made to look foolish. She's standing on one side of the stage.
283 ERNEST: Level-headed to the end, making his way through the pandemonium toward the stage area and the bandstand as fast as he can.
284 CARRIE: Still controlling the hose, she spots Ernest, seeing him move toward the stage area.
286 CARRIE: Realizing just what Ernest plans to do:
CARRIE: ( gently; determined )
287 ERNEST: Is flung invisibly and forcibly away from the area by Carrie's will.
288 FROMM: Big belly and all, trying to steady the mike. He puts his hand on it. The water, however, has reached him, and just as he touches the mic, he's electrocuted ­ his arm bursting into flame, unable to let go as his body goes into an electric dance, his mouth gaping open like a fish on 289 CARRIE Watching this; another flex, and:
289 CARRIE: Watching this; another flex, and:
290 FROMM: Is propelled backwards from the microphone; he falls backward into the cyc, his flaming arm igniting it. A celestial fantasy immediately bursts into flames. It prevents any of the students from using the back exit.
292 CARRIE: Her face flushed, a vein in her forehead throbs, her heart pounding. She spots:
295 COLLINS: moving toward the dazed Ernest, who's recuperating from his bout with Carrie.
296 CARRIE: her heart pounding like an anvil. She's staring at:
298 CARRIE: She flexes.
300 CARRIE: Watching all this ­ a giggle ( or is it a sob? ) emerging from deep within her. Another flex.
303 CARRIE: Spots them. In the instant it takes her to wonder what they're doing there, it's too late. They're out the door, and there's absolutely nothing she can do.
305 CARRIE: As she makes her way down the stage stairs and out onto the floor. She spots the cord going under the stage first, and realizes just how the trick was engineered. that Billy and Chris did 306 THE STUDENTS Moving aside as Carrie walks through them ­ an endless series of blurred, hysterical faces.
311 CARRIE: Turns around and sees it coming toward her.
313 CARRIE: As the Chevy heads right for her, standing in the headlights in its path, bloated, swaying back and forth, her arms thrown out.
315 CARRIE: Flexing, averting the car just as it almost smacks into her. It just misses her.
BILLY: Shut up! Just shut up!
CHRIS: Shut up! Just shut up!
BILLY: Shut up! Just shut up!
317 CARRIE: Her head pounding, flexing.
320 CARRIE: Watching this explosion turn into a conflagration. We see the fire reflected in her puffy, exhausted face ­ brighter and brighter as we HEAR the sound of the WHISTLE merging with SOUND OF SIRENS, and:
CARRIE: ( small voice ) Momma? Momma?
CARRIE: ( louder )
CARRIE: ( louder ) Momma, I'm home.
CARRIE: Silence floods back in. Carrie moves to the foot of the stairs, turning on lights as she goes. She mounts the stairs, goes along the narrow hallway to her room.
MOMMA!: Silence floods back in. Carrie moves to the foot of the stairs, turning on lights as she goes. She mounts the stairs, goes along the narrow hallway to her room.
CARRIE: It is a little child's voice and there is no answer. She goes out into the hallway.
CARRIE: Something ­ a movement? An instinct? makes her turn. She sees:
328 MARGARET: Coming toward her.
329 CARRIE: She flings out her arms and cries out:
CARRIE: Oh, Momma!
331 MARGARET: Carrying the knife, she stares down the stairs.
