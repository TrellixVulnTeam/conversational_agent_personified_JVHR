CATHERINE: Thanks for the horse. He's a shy child, yet comfortable with Catherine.
EDWARD: You liked him?
CATHERINE: He's beautiful. Edward smiles, delighted he made her happy.
EDWARD: ( nods at the ship ) 's broken. Undaunted, she. finds herself standing on the DECK.
CATHERINE: ( calling to him ) Who says?
EDWARD: Oh no. No you don't.
CATHERINE: Oh no. No you don't.
EDWARD: "Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman. Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
CATHERINE: I bet we can fix it. She opens a rusted iron DOOR. It makes an HORRIFIC SCREECHING SOUND. Similar to metal-on-metal, but more piercing, more pained. As if made by a living thing.
MIRIAM: Sing a song of sixpence. IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, there is no reaction from Catherine.
CATHERINE: ( hoarse, groggy ) A pocketful of rye.
CATHERINE: Baked in a pie. IN THE CONTROL ROOM, Henry hits a switch and Catherine is lowered to the pedestal. Miriam checks Monitors displaying Catherine's vital signs and continuing what must be a routine, presses numbers on a keypad to open the PRESSURIZED AIRTIGHT DOOR separating the two areas. IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, lights come on and Miriam eases Catherine out of the apparatus. She checks her pupil dilation, pulse, throat, and reflexes. She pokes and prods with a familiarity that would seem rude to an outside observer, but is nothing to them. Getting to her feet, we see that Catherine's BODYSUIT is made of an unusual dark fabric almost liquid in consistency. AT THE CONSOLE, Henry moves to another section and for the first time, we see there are two elaborate neural monitors. And the "brain" pictured here is smaller. Younger.
HENRY: "Mister E." is doing fine. REVEAL A SECOND FIGURE suspended from the ceiling in the PROCEDURE ROOM. A SMALL BOY is lowered to the pedestal and as Miriam records data, Catherine removes the child's "mask," displaying the haunted face of Edward. Clearly, the boy is in some kind of catatonic state.
MIRIAM: Did we go sailing?
CATHERINE: Almost. Mocky-Lock showed up.
MIRIAM: "Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
CATHERINE: Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass. Henry communicates with them via the intercom.
HENRY: Where did that come from again? Catherine looks annoyed - How could he forget?
CATHERINE: A nursery rhyme. Catherine detaches the cables and eases Edward's frail body into a waiting wheelchair. Miriam takes a penlight and examines the boy's eyes. An emotionless void, oddly Nursery rhymes, fairy tales, the bogeyman. All preparation for the horrors of the real world. Making certain the child is comfortable, Catherine covers him with a blanket, rests a teddy bear on his lap, and pushes him into the CONTROL ROOM, accompanied by Miriam. Henry types in a command and moves to join them.
MIRIAM: ( thinking aloud ) Nursery rhymes, fairy tales, the bogeyman. All preparation for the horrors of the real world. Making certain the child is comfortable, Catherine covers him with a blanket, rests a teddy bear on his lap, and pushes him into the CONTROL ROOM, accompanied by Miriam. Henry types in a command and moves to join them.
HENRY: Anybody hungry? I'm hungry. A BUZZER sounds and ANOTHER DOOR HISSES OPEN. A constantly fretting administrator, BARRY COOPERMAN, is waiting for them in the corridor.
COOPERMAN: Edward's parents are here. We can see it in Catherine's face - this isn't good news.
ELLA: He needs a haircut.
CATHERINE: I'll tell the nurse. God, he loves when you visit.
ELLA: My husband wonders if that's true. He wants to place Edward in a hospital. Seeing an unfunded future, Henry's ready to disassociate himself from Miriam and Catherine.
HENRY: There are other applications for the scanner, Mr. Baines.
LUCIEN: I realize that, Henry. And I know your work, Dr. Kent, is invaluable to this company.
CATHERINE: You don't know about me, though, do you?
LUCIEN: Catherine, we've waited eighteen months for signs of progress.
CATHERINE: There's been progress.
LUCIEN: Yes, but there is no proof the procedure works. All I have is a belief that your interaction with my son is not a Catherine is hurt and vulnerable due to exhaustion and the intensity of her experience with Edward, but feels she must defend herself.
CATHERINE: ( to Cooperman, Miriam, Henry ) You picked me, remember? And I took the job. Gladly. This is the next wave and I want to be part of it.
COOPERMAN: No one is doubting your ability.
CATHERINE: Then what is it? Introspective and solemn-eyed, Lucien takes a moment, then:
LUCIEN: I've invested millions of dollars in this study. And I've convinced others to do the same. I suppose I should feel responsible to them, but I don't. I could care less if they see a profit. I'm responsible to my boy, that's all that matters. You tell me. Am I doing the right OFF CATHERINE'S FACE. INT. WHITE ROOM - DAY At first, we're not sure where we are or what's happening. It's too bright, the space confining. As our eyes adjust, we seem to be in a bathroom or shower stall. We HEAR a WOMAN CRYING and the camera finds ANNE VICKSEY. Dark circles beneath eyes red and puffy from crying. Hair wet and ratted. Sweater and pants damp and stained. Barefoot, she shivers from cold and fear. PULL BACK to show more of her surroundings. The white-tiled 10' x 8' room features a SHOWER HEAD, TOILET, and a push button SPIGOT for drinking water. Two walls are SOLID, the other two MIRRORED, the glass covered by thick clear plastic. The floor is littered with empty food wrappers - candy bars, juice boxes. In the center of the floor is a DRAIN and above her, on the ceiling, a FLUORESCENT LAMP, also encased in clear plastic. There is no door. A mechanism CLICKS. Then a RUMBLING. Anne seems to know what's coming. She presses against the wall, removes her arms from the sleeves of the sweater, hunches down, and raises the garment over her head, forming a tent. WATER ERUPTS from the shower head. There is no steam, so this water must be cold. Shaking, Anne whispers a count to herself - "One-one thousand, two-one thousand, three." and so on. The spray hits everything in the room - mirror, toilet, floor - and a food wrapper drifts toward the drain.
ANNE: She peeks up from the tent, but the water has not stopped, and that isn't what she expected. We hear a soft SUCKING NOISE and a CLICK. The wrapper rises on a puddle of water. Anne POUNDS her fist on the wall.
THIRTY!: A puddle forms around her feet and she realizes the drain has somehow been sealed shut. Her panic intensifies as we hear another CLICK and the water pressure increases.
MIRIAM: You okay? Catherine turns, nods, and tries to smile. Has she been crying? Miriam steps further into the room.
CATHERINE: He hates me.
MIRIAM: Lucien Baines? Catherine nods.
CATHERINE: She thinks I can bring Edward back.
MIRIAM: Someday you can. We all believe that. Catherine halfheartedly nods, but her mind is elsewhere, focused on the two apparatuses.
CATHERINE: I want to try it. Please. Miriam knows what this is about.
MIRIAM: We've been over this a dozen times. No.
CATHERINE: Why not? Just once. A trial run. What harm could it do?
MIRIAM: I don't want to find out. Ever the doctor, Miriam finds herself surreptitiously examining Catherine's eyes, flesh tone, a slight trembling in her fingertips.
CATHERINE: Why is it taking so long for us to reach him? Because we've been reactive, that's why. And we need to be active. Miriam reaches for Catherine's wrist and takes her pulse.
MIRIAM: As Miriam examines her, Catherine continues:
CATHERINE: He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
MIRIAM: I've heard this argument before. It's not happening.
CATHERINE: ( frustrated ) It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
MIRIAM: If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him. Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
CATHERINE: I do it all the time!
MIRIAM: Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, I'd be there for him.
CATHERINE: I'd be there for him.
MIRIAM: And he might blame you for terrifying him. That one moment could erase all you've accomplished. And if that happened, the trust he has in you is Okay, okay. Miriam takes a penlight and examines Catherine's eyes.
CATHERINE: ( defeated ) Okay, okay. Miriam takes a penlight and examines Catherine's eyes.
MIRIAM: Besides, I don't know what it might do to you. You're already exhausted. Have you been sleeping? Catherine nods.
CATHERINE: ( defensively ) Good. We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.
MIRIAM: Good. We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.
CATHERINE: Yes mother.
MIRIAM: I don't want you up all night reading Edward's case file of the nine millionth time. Balance, dear girl, is the key. Leave the work here. She taps Catherine's head.
CATHERINE: Miriam gathers her belongings.
MIRIAM: Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about. Want to come?
CATHERINE: ( declining ) I've got to feed my cat. Besides, I want to get to bed early.
MIRIAM: That's my girl. Miriam exits, but Catherine remains, still curious what could happen if things were reversed.
CATHERINE: Pleasant dreams, Mister E.
CATHERINE: Go. To. Sleep.
RAMSEY: Who found her? Cole nods at a visibly shaken WORKMAN seated in a patrol car.
COLE: Surveyor for the railroad. 'Bout six this morning. Novak sees a FEMALE BODY wrapped in plastic and bound by wire. Supervising the examination of the woman is FBI PATHOLOGIST DR. THEODORE "TEDDY" LEE, a polite, dapper southern gentleman.
NOVAK: Thanks for waiting, Teddy. Teddy gives Novak a friendly, respectful salute - "My pleasure." Novak dons gloves, nods to an FBI PHOTOGRAPHER and assists Teddy Lee in snipping wire and peeling back thick clear plastic. As the photographer reacts to a strong smell, Teddy comments.
TEDDY LEE: As the man snaps pictures, Ramsey and Cole join them. Sadly, Novak recognizes the face.
NOVAK: Anne Marie Vicksey. We recognize her, too.
COLE: She the one from Santa Cruz?
NOVAK: Just graduated law school. Single mom. Had a two-year-old daughter. He and Teddy expose the bleached flesh of her torso, neither man surprised. Coldly thorough, Novak finds another of the killer's tell-tale signs.
TEDDY LEE: Someone looking after her little girl?
NOVAK: Grandparents. Live over in Davis. Novak looks into the dead white eyes of Anne Vicksey, trying to imagine the horrors she beheld. He moves to the creek and sees only a few inches of water. His eyes move from the drop site to the highway above.
TEDDY LEE: The poor thing. FLASH! We're up there now, ON THE OVERPASS, with the photographer and Novak, examining TIRE TRACKS in the soft shoulder. Novak peers over the edge at the crime scene, steps back, and focuses on the highway - imagining the killer's truck as it disappeared into the night.
RAMSEY: Well, honey, what's worse? Doing it yourself or asking your mother for help? Can it wait 'til I get back/ I have no idea, Jeannie. Novak checks his watch and the street. Clearly waiting for someone or something.
NOVAK: How is she?
RAMSEY: Pregnant. Thanks for asking. Novak is distracted by Teddy Lee entering the diner.
NOVAK: Here he is.
RAMSEY: Damn, man, I give up. Your partner tells you his wife's gonna have a baby, and all you care about is a coroner's Ramsey assesses the exhausted, lonely, intense man sitting across from him.
TEDDY LEE: Hot off the presses. He gives them copies of the AUTOPSY REPORT and FORENSIC ANALYSIS of Anne Marie Vicksey. The WAITRESS sees Teddy, approaches, and offers a menu.
RAMSEY: ( unenthused ) More hair. I could knit this guy a Novak finds something in the report that catches him by surprise. He double-checks and shows the item to Teddy.
TEDDY LEE: ( reading ) Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog. Ramsey checks his copy.
NOVAK: Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog. Ramsey checks his copy.
TEDDY LEE: INT. FORENSIC LABORATORY - DAY A MONITOR shows a SINGLE HAIR under a video microscope. Teddy Lee plays with the dials and gets a spectral view.
NOVAK: INT. FORENSIC LABORATORY - DAY A MONITOR shows a SINGLE HAIR under a video microscope. Teddy Lee plays with the dials and gets a spectral view.
TEDDY LEE: Complete absence of melanin. Novak and Ramsey stand over his shoulder.
RAMSEY: And that means? Teddy moves aside and takes another bite of his lunch ( chicken fried steak now carry-out ).
NOVAK: The dog's an albino. He'd love an animal like that.
TEDDY LEE: Gentlemen, I believe an albino dog is rare indeed.
JULIA: Oh no.
JULIA: God. I didn't see you. STARGHER'S HANDS COME AT HER FROM BEHIND! One grabs her hair and the other covers her face with a chloroform-soaked towel. He presses so hard, she cannot scream, cannot move. After a brief struggle, he SHOVES her into her car and holds her until she passes out. Stargher pushes Julia into the passenger seat and starts the car. Pulls a dog treat from his pocket and WHISTLES. The Shepherd instantly perks up. Perfectly healthy. And jumps into the car.
STARGHER: ( feeds him a treat ) Good boy.
NOVAK: Donna Krozin. Helen Francis, Teresa Manicki. The chatter dies.
RAMSEY: A purebred German Shepherd. Novak shows them a picture of a WHITE GERMAN SHEPHERD taken from a resource on the Internet.
NOVAK: Nicole Labetzki. Victim seven. Forensics found dog hair in her car, but they had a K-9 unit at the scene and never had it checked.
TEDDY LEE: The Phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago. And we got the It's his dog. Ramsey holds up a thick list.
NOVAK: It's his dog. Ramsey holds up a thick list.
RAMSEY: Registered breeders of German Shepherds. The list is long and a few of the cops GROAN. Novak silences them with a fierce look that says, "I will not rest until this man is found and neither should you."
NOVAK: Be thorough, but be fast. This guy's He only waited six days this last time. When he started, two months could pass. A DESK SEARGENT enters the room and hands a FAX to Ramsey. Novak is curious about it, but continues.
DISTORTED VOICE: Me god feed on pain. The VOICE echoing inside his skull.
DISTORTED VOICE: Go sleep Carl. Me god wake up now.
RAMSEY: She was still living at home?
MR. HICKSON: Yes, sir.
JOHN: We were looking at apartments.
MR. HICKSON: ( important they know ) But nobody was moving in together 'til after the wedding. Novak hasn't said much. Instead, he looks at something in his hands - a plastic evidence bag containing the TOY DOLL.
RAMSEY: John, you came to pick her up when?
JOHN: Eight o'clock. We were going out for my Maybe you made a mistake. Maybe she. Novak hides the doll.
MR. HICKSON: Maybe you made a mistake. Maybe she. Novak hides the doll.
RAMSEY: No sir. I'm sorry. Ramsey's cell-phone rings and he excuses himself to a corner of the room, leaving Novak alone to deal with this uncomfortable, sad situation, no one saying a word until an emotionally shattered Mrs. Hickson, fingering a rosary, feels compelled to tell him.
NOVAK: After three years she remembers what the guy drove?
RAMSEY: She remembers because it was her "dream truck." Wanted one just like it.
STOCKWELL: Ramsey, Novak? They nod and he directs them to a waiting GMC SUBURBAN.
NOVAK: Where is he?
STOCKWELL: Edison. Just east of Loma Park. SWAT's had the house under surveillance for about twenty minutes. Suspect is Carl Rudolph Stargher. No registered weapons, no priors. Got a license for his dog, though. Named him INT. GMC SUBURBAN - DAY Stockwell is behind the wheel, racing down the highway. Ramsey's in the passenger seat, Novak in back. Shotguns and body armor line the cargo area. Novak's eyes target the FAX, a copy of Stargher's license and registration, and the grainy dot-matrix image of the suspect's face. And Novak knows he's found him.
NOVAK: You're the bad man, aren't you, Carl?
BROCK: Glad you could make it. We lose the sun in half an hour. Novak and Ramsey join him at the shaded window to observe Stargher's house. Children's drawings fill the wall. As Brock explains, Novak checks with binoculars.
NOVAK: Have they seen him?
BROCK: No. There's been movement in the kitchen. But it could be the dog. You think she's in there? Novak is careful with his answer.
NOVAK: We proceed assuming she is.
RAMSEY: Let's give old Carl a call. Tell him he's got company.
NOVAK: ( to Brock ) Can you get a man close?
ERICSON: I'm at the back door.
ERICSON: I have a man down. Repeat, man down.
ERICSON: Can't see his face.
NOVAK: EXT. STARGHER HOUSE - DAY The SWAT TEAM SWARMS towards the house.
ERICSON: He and THREE OTHERS rush inside! BAM! FOUR MEN KICK in and proceed through the FRONT DOOR!
FBI!: He and THREE OTHERS rush inside! BAM! FOUR MEN KICK in and proceed through the FRONT DOOR!
FBI!: An odd quiet is all they encounter. IN THE BACK, Ericson moves through a LAUNDRY ROOM and finds VALENTINE hiding behind a pile of dirty clothes, frightened by these masked figures in black.
ERICSON: ( into throat mic ) I've got the dog! He points for someone to secure the animal and MOVES into the KITCHEN, aiming his gun at the man on the floor, finally getting a look at his face.
NOVAK: Paramedics. NOW. Ramsey pushes through and Novak informs him.
STOCKWELL: They'll take him to County General. Reid's already there.
NOVAK: Make sure he stays cuffed. Two men on him at all times. I don't want anyone treating him but Reid. Not so much as a thermometer up his ass. Understand? Stockwell nods and follows the stretcher outside. A stoic Ramsey enters from the living room and Novak can see the disappointment in his eyes.
RAMSEY: She's not here. Novak would give anything for that not to be true.
JULIA: POUND, POUND, POUND! But there's no response. Only her reflection.
REID: Minimal activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. And here, the anterior cingulate cortex. It's what helps distinguish between external and internal stimuli.
RAMSEY: What the hell does that mean?
TEDDY LEE: ( answering for Reid ) He's schizophrenic. Novak doesn't like this. Not one bit.
RAMSEY: What're you doing here, Reid? Paving the way for his insanity defense?
REID: No need. There won't be a trial. This is no act. The coma is real.
RAMSEY: Whoa. Wait a minute.
REID: You ever hear of Whalen's Infraction? Clearly not.
TEDDY LEE: What about Thorazine? Or. Desoxyn?
REID: The normal psychotropics don't work. He's not just catatonic, he's. disappeared. Like having a dream and never waking up.
NOVAK: This girl. Julia Hickson. Only he knows where she is.
REID: Then I'm sorry. For her and for you. Novak is past angry. He's bordering on devastation. Ramsey attempts to placate him.
RAMSEY: We'll go back to his house, Pete. There's still a lot to do. Analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records. Maybe he owns property somewhere.
NOVAK: They're in that fucking thing for forty hours, Gordon. Four-oh. He got Julia at seven-thirty last night. You know what time it is now.?! Ramsey backs off, knowing his partner is on the verge of really losing it. Reid thinks perhaps he shouldn't, but sensitive to Novak's pain and anger, mentions it anyway - if only to keep his friend from true hopelessness.
REID: Peter? This is a longshot. I mean a real long shot. You're gonna think I'm EXT. EDWARD'S WORLD - DAY The ship's engine ROARS TO LIFE and the PROPELLER spins through sand.
CATHERINE: ( angry, to the heavens ) I'm not signalling! Edward is frightened by what's happening and runs away. Catherine tries to call out, but her throat constricts, making speech difficult.
MIRIAM: ( on intercom ) Sing a song of sixpence.
CATHERINE: ( hoarse ) A pocketful of fucking rye. ( worried ) What's wrong?
MIRIAM: ( cagey ) ( disappointed ) Why did we stop? Cooperman appears in the window and explains.
CATHERINE: ( disappointed ) Why did we stop? Cooperman appears in the window and explains.
COOPERMAN: ( on intercom ) I asked them to. ( with gravity ) We have a situation.
MIRIAM: When did he lapse into the coma?
NOVAK: Sometime yesterday morning. John tries to keep his composure, but Novak's making this tough for him. Novak wants the scientists to see, to understand the boy's pain.
COOPERMAN: ( to Miriam, Henry and Catherine ) John and Ella Baines - as well as the Sunerset Board of Directors - have given their approval, but the decision is What about the legalities of this.?
MIRIAM: What about the legalities of this.?
NOVAK: Stargher is in custody. The functional equivalent of being under arrest. Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. But because of his condition, he doesn't have the capacity to waive those rights.
HENRY: So what you're asking us to do is No, not at all. We're dealing with exigent circumstances. Somewhere there's a kidnapped woman still alive. If we weigh the suspect's Constitutional Rights against the public safety. The Law favors the victim and gives us a lot of leeway. It's called the Public Safety Exception.
NOVAK: No, not at all. We're dealing with exigent circumstances. Somewhere there's a kidnapped woman still alive. If we weigh the suspect's Constitutional Rights against the public safety. The Law favors the victim and gives us a lot of leeway. It's called the Public Safety Exception.
COOPERMAN: So what can you do?
NOVAK: Pretty much anything we want. There's a chance to save a human life. Because of that, Stargher has no reasonable expectation of privacy. Miriam, Henry and Cooperman appear to be onboard. Novak's made a persuasive, heartfelt argument. Only one person still remains uncertain.
CATHERINE: What if.? All eyes turn to her.
NOVAK: As far as I needed. Catherine nods, analyzes Novak's eyes, gestures, body language, and "interrogates" him.
CATHERINE: Do you think he'd tell you what you need to know? John's discomfort is increasing and Novak is sensitive to it.
NOVAK: There's always a chance they'll confess.
CATHERINE: Really? I don't work with violent cases, I work with children. But even a kid lies. They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true. Don't you think Stargher would do the same?
NOVAK: Sometimes. Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure. They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why. Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully. It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean. But these last three. They were still in water - always in water - but Listen, he wasn't just careless. It went beyond that.
CATHERINE: Okay. Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing. Most likely, that part is dead. Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world. I'm sorry, I really am.
RAMSEY: Is it possible?
CATHERINE: If he came to trust me, yes, but it takes months to build that kind of trust. Someone like Stargher can't distinguish between fantasy and reality. It's all the same. He might tell me she's in Timbuktu and absolutely, one hundred percent believe it to be true, but she's.
FBI TECH: ( listing them ) Quantico. San Diego Field Office. S.D., L.A., and San Francisco P.D. California, Arizona, Nevada State Police. Nine and ten are open lines. ( re: radio set up ) Direct link to the chopper. ( re: the computer ) That gets you into the Bureau Database.
NOVAK: Once he's gone, Ramsey takes this moment "alone" to question his partner.
RAMSEY: You sure you want to go through with What else do we do?!
NOVAK: What else do we do?!
RAMSEY: I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake. This is nuts. Do you really understand what they're going to do?
NOVAK: I don't have to.
RAMSEY: Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch. Carl Stargher. That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer. A case that makes careers. But if we push our luck. If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.
NOVAK: Tell you what. If this thing burns us, I take that heat. I give you permission to point your finger at me and say "It was all his idea."
RAMSEY: ( offended ) That's not what I'm talking about, Pete. I'm talking about waking up and realizing this girl's gonna die. The words are anathema to Novak.
NOVAK: That won't happen. Cooperman appears in the doorway and informs them.
COOPERMAN: They're ready. Ramsey looks to his partner, but Novak is already on Cooperman's heels. Resignedly, Ramsey follows.
HENRY: Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
MIRIAM: They took care of that, thank you,
HENRY: Gentlemen, you stand before the one and only Neurological Cartography and Synaptic Transfer System. Although he's listening, Novak's eyes never really stray from his prisoner as Miriam uses safety scissors to cut away Stargher's clothes.
NOVAK: I still don't understand why I can't do this. This isn't some "troubled kid" you're dealing with.
CATHERINE: I realize that.
NOVAK: How hard could it be.? Catherine and Miriam try to hide their laughter.
CATHERINE: The first. What? Six or seven times I went in. Remember what happened?
MIRIAM: Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.
CATHERINE: Like a New Year's Day hangover.
MIRIAM: He needs to be turned over. Novak and Catherine roll Stargher onto his stomach.
NOVAK: This man is deeply disturbed, he.
CATHERINE: You don't know the procedure.
NOVAK: I know him.
MIRIAM: That may be true, but you don't have Catherine's gift. She. What happened here? We see a series of EIGHT BANDAGES.
RAMSEY: We removed eight metal rings. Miriam peels away a bandage and examines the flesh.
CATHERINE: Then he should like this. Catherine connects Stargher to the SUSPENSION APPARATUS and it HOISTS him off the table.
HENRY: Don't touch that, please.
RAMSEY: Miriam prepares a series of CHEMICAL CARTRIDGES and loads them into a container connected to the IV-like tubes linked to the suspension device.
MIRIAM: ( intimate, quiet ) This isn't your responsibility. Remember that. Don't let them use guilt as a tool. If you want to stop, say so.
CATHERINE: I'll be fine.
MIRIAM: She said convincingly. Catherine focuses on the procedure and makes the necessary connections. Reluctantly, Miriam retreats to the monitoring station. She "locks down" the procedure room and joins Henry, Novak, and Ramsey at the console.
NOVAK: ( eyes on the chemical/drug monitors ) That's the stuff?
HENRY: About twelve years of research, right Don't remind me.
MIRIAM: Don't remind me.
RAMSEY: What is it - are they - exactly? That's like asking her to explain the rules of cricket.
MIRIAM: Psychostimulants, serotonin, stabilizers, meprobamate, Neurontin, lithium carbonate. And my baby. It duplicates and expands upon the effects of a chemical called oxytocin, forcing a break in the neuron connections that hold experience. So new experience can Ramsey is utterly lost and just sort of nods, but Novak is fascinated. Catherine presses the bump on her hand. A RED INDICATOR LIGHT flashes on.
HENRY: There's a touch-sensitive microchip implanted in her hand. If she becomes frightened, disoriented, or simply wants to end the session, she signals us to Catherine presses again and the red light shuts off.
MIRIAM: Although none of what she experiences is real, she can be tricked into thinking it is. The mind is awfully gullible, so she needs to monitor herself. Catherine and Stargher are suspended from the ceiling. Henry types and the lights dim to a more somber, tranquil level. Various screens flicker to life, displaying the vital signs of both "feed" and receive." Miriam initiates the injection Catherine? I'm about to start. If you want me to wait, or.
CATHERINE: No. No. IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, we see chemicals mix with her blood, then feed the IV. AT THE CONSOLE, as Henry types furiously at the computer keyboard, Novak asks Miriam:
NOVAK: You said she has a "gift." Overhearing, Henry interrupts, pointing at a section of Catherine's "mind map."
HENRY: Not a gift. A highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all. A genetic fluke.
MIRIAM: Catherine has a tremendous capacity for When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as "receivers." All they did was observe and report. Nothing more. But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening. She understood. And the patient responded. Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things. He knew she A hopeful, solemn Novak gazes through the window, watching Catherine's body as it becomes parallel to Stargher's. IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Catherine takes a deep breath and as the drugs take effect, feels herself losing consciousness. She glances at Stargher, a man who tortures and kills women, then looks up as the CLOTH MASK descends from the ceiling.
ENTRANCE ONE: INT. STARGHER'S WORLD The pattern of the electronics grows into something more organic, textured, concrete. Evolving into a world. Black and shadow-filled, it resembles a labyrinthine complex of vertical walls with cubicle like rooms carved deep into its Our journey into this bleak, grim place continues and we occasionally glimpse brief images of a boy's baptism. INTERCUT with this journey are sections of cloudy blackness and fragmented visions of CATHERINE connected to the apparatus, face masked, DESCENDING into this world. There is an abrupt SHIFT from still images to regular motion and we find ourselves gliding over a tidepool filled with tiny fish and tadpoles. At water's edge, lying on rough, pebble-strewn ground, is a HAND. Catherine's hand. We sense MOVEMENT, but she remains still. From the darkness comes a DOG. Black in color and featureless, it sniffs Catherine, dismisses her, and meanders into a cubicle opposite her, disappearing from view. After a moment of odd quiet, a DROP OF BLOOD hits the mask and we follow Catherine's hand as it moves to the cloth and removes it from her own face. IN MACROSCOPIC SUPER SLOW-MOTIONS, another BLOOD DROPLET sails 64 into the air and comes crashing down, hitting a RED ANT, catapulting it onto what looks like a tree, but is just a TWIG. As the insect scurries away, MORE DROPS pound the earth, splatter against "twig trees," and explode into pools of stagnant water. As we begin to realize that this miniature landscape is the world into which Catherine descended. She sits up, shivering, and breathes deeply, acclimating to her surroundings. The "floor" is covered with filth, ash, pebbles, and insects. Water is present in many forms, puddles, moisture, dripping ceilings. Eyes focusing, queasy, not fully "awake," Catherine notices the crimson stain on the cloth mask and the blood droplets showering the air. She turns and finds the source. THE BLACK DOG stands in the opposite room next to a tub full of BLOOD, shaking himself dry after his "bath." Satisfied, the animal stops and trots away. Still adjusting to this nightmarish realm, Catherine at first doesn't hear it, but then realizes that somewhere, a child is CRYING. She looks around, then through a crack in the "floor," briefly catches sight of a BOY beneath her, on a level lower than hers. As he disappears into corridor ending in "nothing," we PULL BACK to show a MASSIVE LANDSCAPE of blocks, cubicles, crawlspace, walls, stairs, and ladders. Leading everywhere and nowhere. Catherine spots the boy as he crawls into a specific "room." Shortly after, a LIGHT comes on within the cubicle and she moves to it. We feel as though we're looking at a series of interlocked tenement rooms, some walls of which have been torn away to expose rooms within, rooms with no windows or doors. Following a path of fragile steps, Catherine makes her way to the LIGHTED ROOM and enters.
CATHERINE: The frightened child retreats into a corner of the claustrophobic room, but the horse does not startle. Surprisingly - to the boy - the horse takes an affectionate step toward Catherine, inviting her to take over. Catherine allows the mare to smell her, then vigorously scratches along the mane and shoulder, much to the horse's delight.
STARGHER KING: ( primitive, guttural ) Where you come from priddy thing? In a split second, Catherine presses the implant on her hand.
NOVAK: What happened?
HENRY: Must've been rather unusual. Noting Novak's confusion, Henry points to a CENTRAL MONITOR resembling a futuristic V.U. meter, gradiated in sections of white, yellow, orange, and red.
RAMSEY: What happens here?
HENRY: We don't talk about that.
NOVAK: What happens?
HENRY: Well, Theoretically, while she's inside. If she came to believe that Stargher's world is her world, her mind has the power to convince the body that anything done to it is, um, actually done. Novak doesn't like the sound of that.
MIRIAM: Pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please Henry. Henry types a command and Novak speaks into the intercom.
NOVAK: Dr. Kent? IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Miriam eases Catherine back to Deep breaths. When she sees Stargher, Catherine's flesh crawls.
MIRIAM: Deep breaths. When she sees Stargher, Catherine's flesh crawls.
CATHERINE: Is it cold in here?
MIRIAM: What happened? No response.
NOVAK: I'll get her.
NOVAK: Edward Baines, I presume. Hi, Ed. I'm Pete.
CATHERINE: Do you think that's funny?
NOVAK: No. Not at all. From what I understand, he knows I"m here, isn't that right? Catherine nods. Novak picks up Edward's fallen teddy bear and rests it in the crook of the child's arm.
CATHERINE: It doesn't have much to do with science.
NOVAK: What then?
CATHERINE: The soul. The spirit. Whatever you want to call it.
NOVAK: Ah, the part of us that can't be She appreciates his understanding. And finds herself comforted by his presence. Catherine scrutinizes Novak, his intensity, his honesty, his complexity. And asks:
CATHERINE: Agent Novak?
NOVAK: Peter, okay?
CATHERINE: Do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people? The question catches Novak off-guard, but he's willing to answer. Anything to get her talking.
NOVAK: ( realizing it's too personal ) I suppose everyone does.
CATHERINE: Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't That's what therapists are for, right? Catherine laughs. It helps her relax. If only slightly.
NOVAK: That's what therapists are for, right? Catherine laughs. It helps her relax. If only slightly.
CATHERINE: During the sessions. When I'm inside. I see those things. What a person hides, what they despite, what they want to control. With Stargher. This is difficult for her.
NOVAK: What did you see?
CATHERINE: ( professionally ) A kingdom. His utopia. Life without consequence or restriction. He's not even Carl Stargher anymore. He's this. idealized version of himself who can do anything he pleases. Without fear. A horrible primitive ugly thing. ( uncomfortable; re: Edward ) I don't want to talk in here. She kisses Edward's forehead and exits.
CATHERINE: Why'd you bring him here?
NOVAK: You're the shrink, you tell me.
CATHERINE: ( already knows ) As soon as I met him, you knew I'd say yes. He makes Julia real for me. Novak nods. Guilty.
NOVAK: It's an old lawyer trick. Target the emotions. Do it right, you get a reluctant witness to testify, a scared kid to confess. Catherine looks at him with disbelief. "You?!"
CATHERINE: You thought Stargher wanted to be I did, yeah.
NOVAK: I did, yeah.
CATHERINE: You were right. There's a part of him that knows the truth. About what he did, about himself. Novak's curiosity is piqued.
NOVAK: What about Julia?
CATHERINE: This is going to sound terrible, but. I don't think she matters anymore. Not to him. He never finished her. The others.he was able to make them his.
NOVAK: You think you can do this, don't you?
CATHERINE: He might tell me about Julia. The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse. Who wants to be This is Stargher we're talking about?
NOVAK: ( skeptically ) This is Stargher we're talking about?
CATHERINE: Not Stargher, not really. He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster. And an innocent child. If I could reach the boy.
NOVAK: Whoa. Hold on. Aren't they the same Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality? Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act. We're all human.
CATHERINE: Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality? Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act. We're all human.
NOVAK: It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like Then what is he?
CATHERINE: Then what is he?
NOVAK: If you believe that.
CATHERINE: If you believe that.
NOVAK: Maybe this is a big fucking waste of What happened to Charles Gish? Novak doesn't respond. She prods him.
CATHERINE: ( sensing something ) What happened to Charles Gish? Novak doesn't respond. She prods him.
NOVAK: What difference does it make.?
CATHERINE: Tell me. God, he does not want to do this.
NOVAK: Right after the trial, the night after he was released. Mr. and Mrs. Frank Simmons found Charlie sitting in their living room watching TV with their twelve-year old daughter Margaret. He'd cut her right down the middle with a carving knife.
CATHERINE: You're sure of that?
NOVAK: Yes. I am. Catherine realizes that was a confession.
NOVAK: Right here.
RAMSEY: Next time, tell me, okay?
NOVAK: But you looked so cute. All sleepy. Ramsey shoots him a murderous look, then asks Catherine.
RAMSEY: Your colleagues want to know what to do with Stargher. Novak looks to Catherine for the answer. Through the window blinds, she watches John Tracy lower his head.
CATHERINE: Tell them to prep him. And that I'll be right there. Ramsey nods and heads back to the lab.
NOVAK: Thank you. Briefly, he touches her hand. Catherine looks away from John to Novak's hand, to the photographs on the wall. Stargher's house, Valentine, the pick-up truck. Valentine.
CATHERINE: I need something.
CATHERINE: You're a good boy, aren't you, The dog picks up a scent from the procedure room and moves it, Catherine and Novak following. IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Stargher lies face down on a gurney. Now taped to the wall near Stargher are PICTURES from the basement - his dolls, the hoist, etc. Miriam ( in surgical mask and gloves ) carefully re-inserts the METAL RINGS ( taken from an FBI EVIDENCE BAG ) into the eight straps of flesh on his back. When he sees this, Valentine whimpers and hides. Catherine comforts him. Miriam finishes her task and removes her mask.
MIRIAM: I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about I think that's the whole point. Valentine runs to his "sleeping" master and barks at Catherine as if asking for help. She encourages the animal to lick and sniff Stargher's face and hands.
HENRY: I think that's the whole point. Valentine runs to his "sleeping" master and barks at Catherine as if asking for help. She encourages the animal to lick and sniff Stargher's face and hands.
NOVAK: ( comforting and coaching her ) Remember, Julia Hickson is priority number one. Nothing else matters. Find out where she is.
CATHERINE: Okay, okay. LIGHTS FLICKER. Catherine's eyes shut. FADE TO BLACK.
CATHERINE: Don't kid around, Henry. Her suspension apparatus DESCENDS on the floor.
CATHERINE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm not sleepy. As she moves toward the panel, everything becomes larger. By the time Catherine reaches the circuit breaker, it is the size of a garage door. Curiouser and curiouser. She turns around to see the LABORATORY IS EMPTY and DEAD QUIET. And she sees herself - Catherine as small as a mouse trapped in a giant walled space. AT THE CONSOLE, Novak, Miriam and Henry observe the procedure room. And Catherine. Suspended in the apparatus. ENTRANCE TWO INT. STARGHER'S WORLD Catherine turns to see. Catherine lying in the fetal position, locked in a BOX made of thick clean glass. The electronic HUM becomes RHYTHMIC, AMBIENT NOISE.. INSIDE THE BOX, staying calm, she searches for and finds a TRAP DOOR on the floor. She pushes out. The camera executes a complete 180-degree perspective change. Catherine plummets. She tries to reach out, to stop her descent, but cannot. Catherine falls through a dark CAVERNOUS ROOM resembling a mammoth hollowed-out rib cage. Below her is a DOME-LIKE STRUCTURE "growing" out of the floor, a HOLE in the center of its crest. Dozens of other such domes are visible in the murky hell-hole, but Catherine has no choice. She's dropping into this one. Once she passes through the hole, INSIDE THE DOME, Catherine's body looks as though it's moving through water, but there is no water. Like an aerial artist, she reverses her position so she's "heads up." Standing, stable, on the floor. Sensing something with her. And knows it is.

CATHERINE: Out from the darkness, moving in normal motion, comes the white German Shepherd, but in the thick haze, his face is indistinct and ghostly.
CATHERINE: Need some help? As Catherine enters the claustrophobic house, the boy hesitantly pushes a towel toward her, but doesn't look. She reaches the counter and starts to dry, much to Young Stargher's relief. As he washes, Catherine hands him a MIRROR LOCKET just like Edward's.
MARTIN: What did you do know? You make a mess? I hate a mess. Young Stargher backs into a corner, fearing what will come.
WOMAN: I got you a present, cutie-pie. She gives him a TOY DOLL. Drunk, she hugs and kisses him. Embarrassed, the boy tries to squirm away.
MARTIN: Go back to bed, worm.
WOMAN: It's okay, we was just.
MARTIN: Shut up, cunt. The woman cowers, familiar with his violent moods. The boy hurries to his room, but Martin grabs him by the collar.
MARTIN: Only girls play with dolls. He turns and we see Carl is bound to a wooden support beam, a piece of tape covering his mouth. The boy is stripped to the waste, barely conscious, face streaked with tears and sweat.
CATHERINE: I want to help you, Carl. His grin broadens to a smile and he almost laughs.
STARGHER: Help me? That's good. That's a good Liar. Whore. Cunt. Catherine stands her ground.
CATHERINE: You sound like your father. He gets close to her face and sneers.
STARGHER: I am not like him. Stargher retreats into the shadows, but Catherine persists.
CATHERINE: Then help me. Where is Julia Hickson?
STARGHER: Maybe, because you want to.
CATHERINE: Maybe, because you want to.
STARGHER: Is that right? You think you know me?
HENRY: INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - BATHROOM A wave of fear, of impending doom, overtakes Catherine.
STARGHER KING: Now shud you mouth, priddy thing, or me god slice you from the kunt to the tits. Catherine moves to touch the sensor in her hand. He GRABS, LIFTS and SLAMS her onto the floor, the back of her head HITTING HARD. Her vision blurs. Ears are ringing.
MIRIAM: Son of a bitch! IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, VALENTINE BARKS! Startling everyone. The dog GROWLS and backs away. As if he senses something horribly wrong within his master. IN THE CONTROL ROOM, Novak questions the scientists.
NOVAK: When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.
MIRIAM: That was with Edward. She's accustomed to his world. Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory. She's "lost." Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening. And get her out. Until then, she's at his Mercy. Novak's mind reels.
NOVAK: Into Stargher. Inside.
MIRIAM: Novak knows who that person will be.
JULIA: ( trying to remember the words ) Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLASS, we watch her through one-way glass from the video camera's point-of-view. She looks right at "us," in the mirror, saddened by the dark circles under her bloodshot eyes.
MIRIAM: I have done this, you know. Been Miriam nods, knowing he won't accept an opposing argument.
NOVAK: Miriam nods, knowing he won't accept an opposing argument.
MIRIAM: ( instructs him ) Deep breaths. IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM, Henry adjusts monitors showing Novak's vital signs.
HENRY: Pulse is rapid, pressure's a little IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Miriam asks:
MIRIAM: She loads a MICROCHIP SENSOR into a high-pressure injection gun and IMPLANTS it in NOVAK's HAND. He winces from the brief pain as she loads the chemical cartridges.
NOVAK: She loads a MICROCHIP SENSOR into a high-pressure injection gun and IMPLANTS it in NOVAK's HAND. He winces from the brief pain as she loads the chemical cartridges.
MIRIAM: I have to ask you some things. Are you taking any prescription drugs?
NOVAK: Prevacid. For my stomach.
MIRIAM: Any psychiatric medication?
NOVAK: What about narcotics?
MIRIAM: What about narcotics?
NOVAK: I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
MIRIAM: I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
NOVAK: I am. I'm a pretty boring guy.
MIRIAM: I doubt that. Henry checks the "maps," Catherine's vitals and reports.
HENRY: We should hurry. Miriam walks Novak through what's about to happen.
MIRIAM: The first five minutes will be disorienting. Give yourself time. Let the drugs do the work. If you can see, smell, feel, hear, taste things - you're on the right track. Once you've acclimated, try to get a feeling for Catherine. Instinct plays a huge role in this. Trust it. She gives him a supportive touch on the shoulder, exits and shuts the door. IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM, Miriam continues via intercom.
ENTRANCE THREE: INT. STARGHER'S WORLD CLOUDS hover above a dark, gloomy landscape dotted with hills. THREE IDENTICAL WOMEN sit on black earth, their bodies positioned in a uniform pattern. PULL BACK TO REVEAL NOVAK at their feet, in a kneeling fetal position, face down in the gritty soil, a piece of cloth draped over his head. With difficulty, practically inhaling black grit, Novak breathes deeply and rises to his knees. His hand moves to his face and he's briefly astounded by the texture of the gravel, the sharpness of it against his face. Removing the shroud-like cloth, he looks at the soil, smells it, tastes Novak finds the first of the three - VISIONS OF STARGHER'S MOTHER - addressing him. She, like the other two, speaks in a ghostly monotone, nearly devoid of emotion.
MOTHER TWO: ( similar monotone ) My child is an abomination. He is damned. He has no soul. The women's repetitive "monologues" overlap. Aurual layers now added by THREE.
MOTHER THREE: Me god me boy. Me god good son. Novak takes a moment to absorb his surroundings. The sights, sounds and feel of the place. Like being within a dream. As he backs away from the odd quartet, SHIMMERING LIGHT dances across his face. Shading his eyes. Novak searches for the Opposite him, across the valley, is a SHEER ROCK WALL. A massive cliff face pockmarked with rough "windows." Like a star, the LIGHT sparkles inside one of them, a fragment of MIRROR reflecting a beam away from Novak's face to a PATH cutting across the valley floor to the base of the wall. The light guiding him, Novak follows the path and starts to CLIMB, finding stairs or ladders, passing deep, seemingly infinite passages. Like tombs, or the "drawers" of a mausoleum. Deep within one of them, THE LIGHT FLICKERS. Fades. And Novak crawls into darkness.
NOVAK: Not real. Like an ethereal queen of the damned, she strides toward him, narrowing her eyes.
STARGHER KING: Catherine LAUGHS. Novak catches only a fleeting glimpse of the monster before Stargher King GRABS him by the throat and SMASHES his head against a pedestal.
NOVAK: You're Catherine Young. You majored in Psych at UC San Diego. You work for Sunerset Industries. Stargher King's fingers pass over an array of horrific instruments - the throat piercer/collar mechanism, a cleaver knife, a misshapen hammer, a long slender needle.
STARGHER KING: ( finally speaking ) Me god gut you like a dear. Although we don't see it, we HEAR something awful. Like Stargher King fishing around inside the wound. A pale, sweating Novak tries to stay conscious. He will not go into Not real. Not real. Not real. A FEMALE HAND grabs the tool from the tray.
NOVAK: Not real. Not real. Not real. A FEMALE HAND grabs the tool from the tray.
STARGHER KING: ( mimicking Novak, laughing ) Nod reel, nod reel, nod reel.
CATHERINE: Like hell "wait." But she won't listen and he's forced to play catch up as she moves further from the den toward the cliff face. The FLICKER OF LIGHT shines on the entrance to a specific TUNNEL.
NOVAK: Like hell "wait." But she won't listen and he's forced to play catch up as she moves further from the den toward the cliff face. The FLICKER OF LIGHT shines on the entrance to a specific TUNNEL.
CATHERINE: He wants us to follow. The little Little boy?! That's him!
NOVAK: Little boy?! That's him!
CATHERINE: He brought you to me, didn't he? If you want Julia to live, trust me. Trust INT. TUNNEL/CUBBYHOLE On her hands and knees, she enters the TUNNEL, not waiting for him to respond. She knows what he'll do. Catherine and Novak crawl through the dark, grimy claustrophobic space, playing with his mirror locket.
CATHERINE: He so desperately wants her affection, but fear prevents him from reaching out to her.
NOVAK: Where the hell are we?
CATHERINE: Carl, do you know? Like on a map. He shakes his head and buries his face in her shoulder.
NOVAK: Let's go. He pulls her to her feet. Feeling betrayed and rejected, the child breaks away from her. THE ROAR OF STARGHER KING shakes the cell. Terrified, the boy searches for a place to hide.
CATHERINE: Novak feels what's coming.
CARL!: Novak feels what's coming.
NOVAK: COME ON! I can't leave him! STARGHER KING APPEARS! His throat wounded, bloody mess, he descends out of dark nothingness, HOWLING with rage. He reaches for Catherine, but Young Stargher runs in front of STARGHER KING CLAMPS HIS MASSIVE ARMS AROUND THE CHILD! Little Carl opens his mouth in a silent scream. Catherine's arms reach out to him, but Novak clasps her hand and presses. And she is haunted by the sight of a frightened child in the arms of a monster.

Catherine's arms reach out to him, but Novak clasps her hand and presses. And she is haunted by the sight of a frightened child in the arms of a monster.
HENRY: They're back. Everything happens fast. He and Miriam frantically cease the Novak and Catherine are lowered and Novak startles them by quickly regaining consciousness. Miriam attempts to inject him with stabilizing drugs, but he's already trying to tear himself out of the apparatus.
NOVAK: Get me out! Miriam MOVES into the PROCEDURE ROOM.
MIRIAM: Don't move! Novak is not listening. Fighting off any after-effects- both physical and mental - he moves for the door.
NOVAK: Is she alright?
MIRIAM: Yes. But you're going to sit down right now. I have to. Novak is already gone.
NOVAK: This is Novak, who've I got? A confused Ramsey enters and listens.
COLE: Agent Cole.
NOVAK: I need you to find something in the Already there.
COLE: Already there.
NOVAK: That hoist, with the winch. WE FOLLOW Cole as he moves to the machine.
COLE: ( reading ) Carver Industrial Equipment.
NOVAK: Find out the history of that machine. Who bought it, used it, sold it. And check Stargher's pay stubs. I want to know every contractor he worked for. I'm calling you from the chopper in ten Dizziness and disorientation again hit Novak. Pale and sweating, he winces as his stomach agonizingly cramps.
RAMSEY: Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell.
NOVAK: Considering where I've been. Fighting the pain, he gathers together MAPS, slips on his shoes and grabs gun and holster. Ramsey is apoplectic.
RAMSEY: Whoa-whoa-whoa. Mind telling me what the fuck is happening? Novak points to the photo of Stargher's basement, specifically the hoist.
NOVAK: I saw her. Julia. Alive. I saw You might've seen Jimmy Hoffa dancing with Timothy Leary. I don't care. Novak is not stopping.
RAMSEY: You might've seen Jimmy Hoffa dancing with Timothy Leary. I don't care. Novak is not stopping.
CATHERINE: .a pocketful of rye.
MIRIAM: Four and twenty blackbirds.
CATHERINE: Baked in a pie. AT THE CONSOLE, on a security monitor, Henry can see Novak and Ramsey exiting down the corridor.
HENRY: The FBI has left the building. IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Miriam appears concerned.
MIRIAM: Damn him.
CATHERINE: What's wrong?
MIRIAM: Agent Novak. I didn't get a chance to clear him. Catherine encourages her.
CATHERINE: Go. I'm fine. Go. As Miriam hurries to catch Novak, she tells Henry.
MIRIAM: Keep an eye on her. He nods, but isn't really paying attention. Catherine turns to Stargher's motionless form, still suspended, still connected to the machinery.
JULIA: Do something, Julia. She looks around the room and runs her hands along the walls, the tile, looking for a weak spot. She focuses on the CEILING PANEL and although it's painful because of swollen fingers, removes her ENGAGEMENT RING.
RAMSEY: Pete, listen to me. What did you really learn in there? Anything new? You really think Stargher gave you a save the-day clue? What if this is all some kind of trick your head is playing on He won't consider that. Novak climbs into the helicopter and buckles himself in. He looks to Ramsey - you coming? - Ramsey pats the side of the chopper and signals for the pilot to take off.
HENRY: .there was a moment when we thought we'd lost Agent Novak as well. We see chemicals flow and computer programs initiate the procedure, but Henry is oblivious.
HENRY: ( flustered ) She changed the codes.
MIRIAM: What's wrong?
HENRY: It would take hours to re-route the system, and even if I did, I shouldn't.
RAMSEY: What are you talking about? Miriam analyzes the situation and regretfully, angrily, worriedly realizes what's happened.
MIRIAM: She's done it. Stupid, stupid girl.
RAMSEY: Done what?
HENRY: Instead of going into his mind.
MIRIAM: She's bringing Stargher into hers.
ENTRANCE FOUR: INT. CATHERINE'S WORLD A bright, deliriously colorful realm visually reflective of things we saw in Catherine's home. Unusual trees, rock formations, totems, statues, and a brilliant POOL OF WATER. The pond ripples. Visible through the crystal-clear water is YOUNG STARGHER, rising to the surface like a drowning victim suddenly breaking through to air. Panicked, he scrambles to shore and pulls himself to land. Although the place is comforting and beautiful, he's in strange territory and it frightens him. Shivering, he hunches down, eyes darting this way and that.
YOUNG STARGHER: Catherine is astonished and relieve to hear him speak. A sad, trembling little voice.
CATHERINE: ( regretfully ) Oh.no, honey, I'm sorry. It's doesn't work that way. The boy breaks away from her, turning his back. She gently takes his hand but he yanks it free.
YOUNG STARGHER: He found me. Catherine bristles as STARGHER KING RISES FROM THE POOL like a human serpent. The brilliant colors of Catherine's world fade to GRIM TONES.
STARGHER KING: Where thiisss att?!?! Me god no like id He snarls when he sees Catherine.
CATHERINE: STARGHER KING Stargher King laughs.
STARGHER KING: Stargher King laughs.
CATHERINE: I said no. Like a vengeful Valkyrie, she emits what can only be called a BATTLE CRY! STARGHER ATTACKS! Arms reaching for her. Catherine BLOCKS, PUNCHES, AND KICKS. Stargher King doubles over. Catherine grabs his ears and pulls his face into her bent KNEE, breaking his nose.
STARGHER KING: You funny. You thing you stop me god? HE CHARGES. At the right moment, Catherine sidesteps and SMASHES him in the ribs as he passes. Stargher King crumples to the ground and she KICKS an uppercut to this chin. Rising from the mud and muck, Stargher King lands a POWERFUL BLOW to her head, sending her flying. He lifts the stunned Catherine with one hand and pulls her face to his.
CATHERINE: My world. A SHIMMERING KNIFE seems to enrage from within her forearm, out the flesh and into her hand.
CATHERINE: No one deserves it, Carl. No one. She reaches out to him, but the child is JERKED into the air by Stargher King. In one hand, the monster holds little Carl. In the other - a KNIFE. His face and chest red with crimson, Stargher King fixes his eyes on Catherine with a predator's stare.
STARGHER KING: Yer world. My knife. Stargher King raises the blade toward the boy's throat and - SNAP! The strong arms of an adult Stargher breaks his arm at the elbow. Both the knife and boy are dropped to the ground as Stargher King YOWLS like a stuck pig, the good arm cradling the other.
STARGHER: Stargher King regards him with disgust.
STARGHER KING: MARTIN STARGHER'S VOICE comes from the belly of the beast.
STARGHER: I'll tell you what's enough. Stargher and Stargher King square off. The boy stands between them with the knife at his feet.
CATHERINE: STARGHER KING ( still speaking as Martin ) Shut up cunt. ( to the boy ) Give it here, worm. the child picks up the blade and stands between them, looking to Catherine for guidance.
STARGHER KING: ( still speaking as Martin ) Shut up cunt. ( to the boy ) Give it here, worm. the child picks up the blade and stands between them, looking to Catherine for guidance.
STARGHER: And he DRIVES the thing into Stargher King's heart. For a brief moment, Martin's face is superimposed over Stargher King's. Stunned, he slumps and regards adult Stargher with sad, troubled eyes.
MARTIN: ( as Stargher King ) Why? What'd I do?. Stargher TWISTS the handle of the blade and Martin/Stargher King drops dead. Dead. Young Stargher smiles and hugs Time to go 'way.
YOUNG STARGHER: Time to go 'way.
CATHERINE: The boy runs to adult Stargher who lifts the child into his arms and holds him close.
YOUNG STARGHER: She looks to adult Stargher and begins to understand. He descends into the pool, the boy resting his head on his Man and boy disappear beneath the water's surface. Catherine stands and sees that Stargher King's body has vanished. She walks to the shore and sees, deep underwater, Stargher and little Carl floating lifelessly like women in the cell. And FADE FROM VIEW.
STARGHER KING: Thank you, Catherine. You did help me. More than you'll ever know. Man and boy disappear beneath the water's surface. Catherine stands and sees that Stargher King's body has vanished. She walks to the shore and sees, deep underwater, Stargher and little Carl floating lifelessly like women in the cell. And FADE FROM VIEW.
CATHERINE: Goodbye Carl. She presses the sensor in her hand.
MIRIAM: He's in full arrest. Catherine quietly returns to consciousness and is automatically lowered. She pulls the mask from her face, rises and opens the door. Miriam races inside and desperately attempts to revive Stargher. But it's no use. Angry and stunned, she demands of Catherine.
PILOT: Agent Novak? Go ahead.
NOVAK: EXT. STARGHER'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Cole and a handful of other agents pour into waiting Suburbans. ( INTERCUT WITH NOVAK IN HELICOPTER ).
COLE: The hoist was manufactured by Carver Industrial Equipment in 1982. Serial number 117-337J. Purchased by a boat shop in Lake Havasu, but sold to Lattimer's industrial Supply in 1992.
CATHERINE: Everything's alright now, Valentine. I INT. HELICOPTER Novak scans the topography of FARMS below, listening to a new INT. SUBURBAN - DAY Cole is the passenger, on the radio to Novak, A DRIVER next to him, doing about a hundred down the Interstate, SIREN Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named Bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near Delano. Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it's just sitting there.
COLE: Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named Bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near Delano. Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it's just sitting there.
NOVAK: Yep. And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
COLE: Yep. And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
NOVAK: You're kidding me.
COLE: I never kid. My wife hates it. Says I'm too serious. Novak locates Delano on the map.
NOVAK: The exact location, Cole. Give it to The pilot grins and pushes the copper to top speed.
NOVAK: TAKE IT DOWN! INT. THE CELL - DAY Julia tries to hold herself up by pressing her arms and legs against the walls, but as she does, the straw slips from her mouth. She reaches for it, but only succeeds in pushing it away from her. It heads for the drain. And disappears.
NOVAK: Cut the engine! As the motor dies, Novak listens and listens. There it is. Water pipes beneath his feet. And very faintly, a pounding. He follows the sound, searching the earth. It's clearer now, louder. Novak tosses aside rusted junk and the pilot runs to assist him. Together, they expose the entrance to the underground sanctuary.
NOVAK: The thick Plexiglass still remains, but she now can see him. Novak pulls his ID BADGE and smacks it against the glass.
JULIA!: The thick Plexiglass still remains, but she now can see him. Novak pulls his ID BADGE and smacks it against the glass.
MOVE ASIDE!: He pulls his gun and takes aim. Julia swims to the top of the cell and presses herself against the ceiling. BANG-BANG BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG. Novak fires a circle of shots into the thick plastic. Water slowly leaks, but the damn thing is still solid. He lifts the industrial VCR and RAMS it at the bullet-damaged section. CRACK! CRASH! WATER POURS FROM THE CELL. Julia's body descends on the torrent of water. Novak reaches inside and pulls her to safety. He's just about to give her CPR when she coughs, sputters, and thirstily drinks in oxygen. Holding her tightly, Novak sinks to the floor, the water from the cell spilling everywhere.
MIRIAM: I left the nutritional information on the fridge door. Read it. Catherine nods, but she's more interested in the movie. Miriam deposits prescription bottles onto a side table.
CATHERINE: I don't need them anymore.
MIRIAM: I know. But she leaves them just the same.
CATHERINE: Thanks Miriam. Say hi to Henry and.
MIRIAM: .give a kiss to Edward.
CATHERINE: ( overlapping ) Give a kiss to Edward. The women exchange smiles and Miriam exits.
MIRIAM: Agent Novak.
NOVAK: Dr. Kent.
MIRIAM: You're looking well.
NOVAK: Thanks you. Six weeks off does a body I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward.
MIRIAM: That's a secret.
NOVAK: Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. We know all, see all. Novak opens the rear compartment of the Suburban and we hear something moving inside.
MIRIAM: Awaiting his arrival.
NOVAK: What about the cat?
MIRIAM: Completely unaware. Miriam's pager BEEPS and she hurries to her car.
NOVAK: Catherine cradles her cat.
CATHERINE: He opens the door and escorts a leashed VALENTINE into the living room. Catherine's cat squirms from her arms and hides under the couch.
NOVAK: That went well.
CATHERINE: Give her a minute. Hello, Valentine. Novak unleashes the albino Shepherd and he runs to Catherine, licking her face, wagging his tail.
NOVAK: You sure about this?
CATHERINE: ( calling for the cat ) Valentine picks up the cat's scent and sniffs around the base of the sofa.
NOVAK: Yep. Eloped.
CATHERINE: Good for them. Valentine settles on the floor. Slowly, Abigail's curiosity gets the best of her and she creeps out, sniffing the dog's nose. Patient and sweet, Valentine lies still, allowing the cat to reach an acceptable level of comfort.
NOVAK: Well look at that.
CATHERINE: I told you. You have to be optimistic. Believe in them.
NOVAK: So you say. Amazingly, Abigail brushes up against the dog and purrs.
CATHERINE: He's mine?
NOVAK: All yours. My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever Catherine laughs. She likes that.
CATHERINE: It doesn't matter.
NOVAK: I don't know. I think it does. You know, Catherine. If you ever want to talk about it. What happened to Stargher. That last time. It's painfully clear the thought of it still troubles her.
CATHERINE: Not just yet. Okay? Novak doesn't push it. He just takes her hand and gives it a gentle squeeze. The cat dashes into the kitchen and Valentine follows.
NOVAK: I got it. He moves into the kitchen. In a moment of quiet introspection, Catherine looks at the television screen, at Dorothy accidentally hitting the wicked Witch with a bucket of water, causing her to melt. And she looks away, unable to watch, disturbed by the image. She turns to the kitchen and sees Novak feeding an appreciative dog and cat. He rises and returns to the living room.
CATHERINE: Thank you.
NOVAK: No problem.
CATHERINE: No. Thank you. He smiles and nods, gently resting his hand on her shoulder. Catherine shuts her eyes and leans toward him, comforted by simple human touch.
