STACY: He doesn't give up easy. He playfully wrestles his hand free and slides it under her skirt. She grabs his hand again.
STACY: I said no.
ROD: But you don't really mean it.
STACY: Yes I do. Keep it in your pants Rod.
ROD: Maybe it won't stay in.
STACY: Maybe you better just drive me home.
ROD: Let me just ask you a serious question first.
STACY: Aren't you worried you could die a virgin?
ROD: Aren't you worried you could die a virgin?
STACY: ( sarcastically ) Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming.
ROD: On our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. Terminate us instantly. We'd never experience what it means to make love.
STACY: If sheep don't count.
ROD: That wasn't me .
STACY: I know. I'm kidding you. Chill out.
ROD: Well I'm trying to be real here and you're mocking me.
STACY: ( softening ) I'm sorry, but you're not going to die a virgin Rod.
STACY: Stop it.
STACY: ( exasperated ) You're being unfair.
ROD: ( exasperated ) You're being unfair.
STACY: Yes. Unfair to me.
ROD: Yes. Unfair to me.
ROD: Stacy! I'm sorry.
ROD: Please get back in the car, Stacy.
STACY: No answer.
STACY: Is that you Rod?
STACY: Come out Rod. This SCREAM bull shit ain't gonna work with me!
STACY: ( terrified ) Rod? You're freaking me out. Game's over. I lose. Come out and we'll fuck.
STACY: ( in full panic )
NO!: Stacy starts to run. The killer starts after her.
STACY: The killer catches Stacy from behind and savagely smashes her head against a tree, cracking a branch. Stacy falls to the ground, dazed.
ROD: STACY( O.C. ) ( struggling, in the distance )
ROD!: EXT. WOODS The killer kicks Stacy in the side, instantly shutting her up. He gags her and ties her to a tree trunk. She struggles, but she's no match for the INT. CAR Rod grabs his flashlight from the glove compartment.
ROD: EXT. WOODS The hammer descends on the nail. Stacy screams out in pain, even through the gag, as he hand is nailed to the tree.
JODY: Cut it out.
KENNY: I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
JODY: I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
KENNY: So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't
JODY: I got to get home.
KENNY: Fuck your curfew. Most sixth graders can stay out later than you.
JODY: She pulls his hand out of her pants. He stares at her for a second, completely exasperated. He sits up and starts the car.
KENNY: You know, maybe we ought to start seeing other people.
JODY: Jody, we've been going out for over a year. I love you but I'm all out of patience.
KENNY: Jody, we've been going out for over a year. I love you but I'm all out of patience.
BRENT: It's almost ten o'clock.
JODY: Daddy you scared me!
BRENT: You're grounded Friday night!
JODY: What? I WAS AT SANDY'S I JUST
BRENT: Your curfew is 9:30 and you know it, little miss.
JODY: It won't happen again.
BRENT: You said that two weeks ago.
JODY: Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
BRENT: They're not all the sheriff's daughter.
JODY: Hello. ( beat ) One second. Hey Adolph, it's the station!
BRENT: MARGE MARKEN, Jody's mother, comes out of the bedroom, sensing something terrible has happened. Marge is a couple of years older than Brent. She's a bit lifeless, a pretty woman who's whole life is her daughter and a bottle of Peachtree Schnapps.
MARGE: What happened?
BRENT: Two kids were found mutilated in the woods. Lock the door after me.
DEPUTY: Her parents reported her missing about an hour ago.
BRENT: What kind of a person wakes up in the morning and says to themselves, 'Think I'll nail a sixteen year old girl to a tree today'?
DEPUTY: The same type that decides to carve into her stomach.
MONTAGE: High school kids are getting ready for school. Body parts are being covered. Pants and stocking are pulled up over bare teenage legs. Shirts and bras cover bare teenage chests. Zippers are pulled tight. Buttons are buttoned. The school bell rings and the kids arrive in cars, on bikes, walking. IT'S A TYPICAL small town American high school, somewhat repressed but alive. The news spreads quickly about the double killing as the crowd splits into its various tribes: punk rockers, jocks, potheads, cheerleaders, nerds. The killing is on everyone's mind.
CLASSMATE 1: CLASSMATE 2 Was Stacy raped?
JODY: CLASSMATE 2 Was Stacy raped?
CLASSMATE 2: Was Stacy raped?
JODY: I dunno. My dad never came home last night.
MR. MARLISTON: No one understands what leads people to do irrational things. We only know that unpunished violence festers, then explodes.
JODY: Yes Mr. Marliston?
MR. MARLISTON: Your dad's in the principal's office. He wants to see you.
TOM: You aren't planning to tell these kids that 'virgin' was tattooed into both Stacy and Rod, are you?
BRENT: But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
TOM: But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
BRENT: But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
TOM: Fine, just don't mention the carving This is going to be a tough enough day as it is.
BRENT: Hi honey.
JODY: Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.
TOM: Hi Jody.
BRENT: I just wanted to check that you were okay?
JODY: I'm fine. I've just never had someone my age die before. It's so weird.
BRENT: How well did you know Stacy and I've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything.
JODY: I've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything.
BRENT: Had either of them broken up with someone recently? Hurt someone?
JODY: No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now.
BRENT: I want you to head right home after school.
JODY: I will. Is that all?
TOM: Could you tell Mr. Marliston we'd like to see him.
JODY: She leaves.
BRENT: Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston?
TOM: The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that?
BRENT: She's my daughter, Tom.
TOM: So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
BRENT: So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
TOM: Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually
LEONARD: You rang?
TOM: Come in Leonard. Have you met Brent Marken?
LEONARD: No but I've always wanted to.
BRENT: Nice to meet you too. My daughter speaks highly of you.
LEONARD: We have the same color eyes.
BRENT: I guess we do.
JODY: Go sit next to him.
SANDY: Mark Shale.
JODY: Mark Shale.
SANDY: Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.
JODY: Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.
SANDY: I don't watch him eat everyday.
JODY: You stare at him non-stop, like every lunch. Like this. Like most people stare at car accidents.
SANDY: The seat behind him is open. Come on, I can eavesdrop too.
JODY: You eventually have to talk to him.
SANDY: Why? All my mom and dad ever do is watch each other eat and they've been married for twenty years.
CINDY: Jody starts toward her table.
SANDY: No! That's his table.
JODY: You're going to look really amoebic splitting off from me now. Did your dad question you this morning?
CINDY: Did your dad question you this morning?
JODY: Just a little.
BEN: Did he ask you if Stacy and Rod has ever exchanged bodily fluids?
JODY: No. Why?
CINDY: He asked Marliston.
JODY: If they had ever gone all the way?
BEN: Yeah. Chris BERRINGER WAS PARKED
CINDY: I wonder why it's so important to know if they fucked?
BEN: What I don't understand is why they asked Marliston if Rod was a virgin. They could have asked you Cindy.
CINDY: I never fucked Rod.
BEN: Exactly. Then he must be a virgin.
ANNETTE: You're a shitsucking liar!
DYLAN: ( taunting ) Better than being a 'cocksucking' Shut your face!
ANNETTE: Shut your face!
ANNETTE: He's been telling people..
LEONARD: You can tell me all about it in my office. Calm down. We're all on edge today.
SANDY: What's up with that?
MARK: Dylan's been telling people that Annette gave him a blow And she didn't?
SANDY: And she didn't?
BEN: There's a better chance that he got head from all five Spice Girls.
SANDY: That's horrible.
CINDY: I think it's funny.
BEN: Me too. I'm going to start telling people that I saw her drop
JODY: You wouldn't?
BEN: I would if Dylan paid me.
SANDY: ( flustered ) What am I supposed to say? 'Nice sweater Mark'? 'Did you buy it at Eddie Bauer's?'
JODY: ( teasing a bit ) You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
SANDY: You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
JODY: You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
SANDY: You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
JODY: But you can't do any of it. So it sucks. I always have to 'set an example'.
SANDY: He's just trying to mess with your head. Ignore Does she fuck?
JODY: Does she fuck?
SANDY: ( trying to comfort ) I doubt it. Who'd want to fuck her. She probably reeks worse than the docks down in those panties.
JODY: ( frustrated ) Mr. Jenkins called on me in class today. It was so embarrassing. I was seriously spaced. I'd been thinking about Kenny for over twenty minutes. When I snapped out of it, I looked pathetic. I was teared up. Everyone was staring at me.
STACY: What did you say?
JODY: That I was sorry. I'd drifted off. That I'd been thinking about Stacy and Rod.
SANDY: Oh nice save.
JODY: I was desperate. It was gross.
SANDY: Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring He says he loves me.
JODY: He says he loves me.
SANDY: Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.
JODY: ( musing ) Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out.
SANDY: You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.
JODY: You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.
SANDY: That was before he pulled this 'Dick me or I dump you' shit. I say fuck his best
JODY: I don't know what I'm so scared of.
SANDY: Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . .
JODY: How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
SANDY: I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference.
JODY: I promised I'd go right home after school.
SANDY: OK. increase the peace.
ANNETTE: ( suspicious ) I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
ANNETTE: KILLER( O.C. ) He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
ANNETTE: ( really angry ) He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually KILLER( O.C. ) I think I know how to restore your ( excited ) You do?
ANNETTE: ( excited ) You do?
ANNETTE: Annette unlocks the chain. The killer heads inside. THE DOOR OMINOUSLY closes behind them.
ANNETTE: INT. RESTAURANT More wine is poured. The two couples eye each other, giggling.
MOTHER: Annette. We're home.
MOTHER: ( concerned )
MOTHER: Her dad lifts his foot and starts kicking at the door. It begins to splinter.
MOTHER: She notices the shade to the other window has been drawn and is flapping oddly, caught on something. She walks over, frightened, gathers her nerve, then pulls the shade up. Annette has been nailed to the outside of the house, her dead eyes looking 'VIRGIN' is carved deeply in her forehead. Her mother screams.
BRENT: Is Jody still awake?
MARGE: She just turned off her light.
JODY: Come in.
BRENT: Hi honey.
JODY: What's wrong?
BRENT: I have a question to ask you. A personal question.
JODY: ( uncomfortable ) How personal?
BRENT: I need to know how far you and Kenny went?
JODY: What do you mean?
BRENT: ( gently probing ) Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
JODY: Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
BRENT: I'm not criticizing. Did you two get any further?
JODY: A little.
BRENT: How much further?
JODY: Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS
BRENT: I wouldn't ask if I didn't have Not much further.
JODY: Not much further.
BRENT: You never went, uh, all the way?
JOY: ( sighs )
BRENT: ( very worried ) ( confused ) Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
JODY: ( confused ) Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
BRENT: No honey.
JODY: You are upset.
BRENT: I'm not.
JODY: ( upset ) I thought you'd be pleased.
BRENT: I am. I'm so very proud of you. Go back to sleep.
MARGE: She's still a virgin.
BRENT: She's still a virgin.
MARGE: Did you warn her?
BRENT: No. Let her get at least one more peacefully night's
BRENT: If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today.
TOM: Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
BRENT: is there anything you do?
TOM: Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.
BRENT: I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.
TOM: You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
BRENT: Better than a pile of dead teenagers.
BRENT: I think you all know why I CALLED THIS Town meeting. In the last two days, three of our children have been murdered and it appears that we have now established a common link between the killings.
FATHER 1: Well, what is it?
BRENT: All three of the victims attended our public high school and all three were or appear to have been.um.virgins.

BRENT: We found the word 'virgin' written at both crime scenes.
FATHER 1: Why didn't you tell us this yesterday?
BRENT: We didn't think this was a serial killer. We thought it was an isolated incident.
MOTHER 3: Are you close to an arrest?
BRENT: I can't say we are.
FATHER 2: What are we supposed to do?
BRENT: What do you mean?
MOTHER 2: What are we supposed to tell our kids?
FATHER 2: To go out and get laid if they wanna feel safe?
BRENT: I think that's' up to each and everyone of you.

FATHER 2: I wouldn't worry about it Victor.
FATHER 3: What's that supposed to mean?
FATHER 2: FATHER 3 What are you saying about my
FATHER 3: What are you saying about my
FATHER 2: ( getting worried ) Calm down. I was joking.
FATHER 3: Hell of a time to be joking about a thing like that you sick bastard!
SANDY: ( really worried ) What are we going to do?
JODY: Sandy, you have to chill out, at least two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins. He can't butcher all of us.
SANDY: There will be a lot fewer by tomorrow night.
JODY: Not that many.
SANDY: You watch. There's going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow. Maybe I'll finally talk to Mark
JODY: There's a sound on the phone. Sandy's brother ANDY has picked it up.
NO?!: There's a sound on the phone. Sandy's brother ANDY has picked it up.
SANDY: Andy! I'm on the phone!
SANDY: Your services?
ANDY: I'm willing to help save her life. Jody, if you want to come over right now. We could slip up into the attic for a few minutes. There's an old mattress up there.
SANDY: Andy hangs up laughing.
MOM!: Andy hangs up laughing.
JODY: Jody tries to call back but the phone isn't working. This spooks her. The doorbell rings downstairs. Now Jody is more than spooked. She's SCARED. She goes to the window to see who it is.

JODY: KILLER( O.C. ) I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.

JODY: His mother's an only child.
JODY: Jody smashes to the ground.
JODY: It was a she.
BRENT: Are you sure?
JODY: She said she was Kenny's aunt Lisa.
BRENT: What are you doing?
MARGE: This will relax her.
BRENT: She's underage.
SANDY: Oh my god. ARE YOU OK?
JODY: Someone tried to kill me.
SANDY: The phone just went dead. I called the police and ran right over as fast as I could.
MOTHER: You're wearing a skirt?
SANDY: Bye mom.
MOTHER: No way is Sandy turning around.
SANDY?!: No way is Sandy turning around.
CINDY: I'm not fucking you. Not for all your CDS.
BEN: You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight.
CINDY: ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN? WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
BEN: WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
CINDY: Your mind is just twisted enough. I believe you'd do all this just to get a dip or two.
SANDY: Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.
MARK: Hi Sandy.
BEN: Did you want something?
SANDY: ( almost frozen ) Yes.( beat ) I was just curious Mark, if you brought a Twinkie
BEN: ( sarcastically ) You wonder about that everyday Sandy?
MARK: Shut up Ben. Actually, my mom always packs two.
SANDY: You got a great mom. I'm lucky to get a zucchini Did you want one?
MARK: Did you want one?
SANDY: ( trying to cover ) Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with They're tasty.
MARK: They're tasty.

MARK: You can have both if you want.
SANDY: No, you keep one.
JODY: A little larger nose.
ARTIST: How's that?
JODY: That's her.
ARTIST: Brent, we got a sketch.
JODY: You know her?
BRENT: It can't be.
JODY: Who is she Daddy?
BRENT: Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today.
BRENT: IT'S LISA SHERMAN. But she still looks like we're eighteen.
TOM: ( on phone ) That's impossible.
BRENT: ( growing frantic ) I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling.
TOM: Calm down Brent.
BRENT: I'll call you right back.
BRENT: You were eavesdropping.
JODY: ( a little scared ) No I wasn't.
BRENT: What did you hear?
JODY: Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say Ok. Goodbye. Now get back to school.

MARGE: If I have to. Please let me protect you.
JODY: ( asserting herself ) I'm not leaving. I want to know why you and dad are so freaked out. Three of my classmates are dead.
MARGE: ( asserting herself ) I'm not leaving. I want to know why you and dad are so freaked out. Three of my classmates are dead.

MARGE: Years ago, something horrible happened in this town. When I was still in high school. A girl named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors.
JODY: Attacked how?
MARGE: She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
JODY: You didn't believe her?
MARGE: ( confessing ) No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally Why not?
JODY: Why not?
MARGE: They were children of our leading citizens, stars of the football team. And she was a loner. An angry girl that no one really liked. She'd called them 'queers'.
JODY: People thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'?
MARGE: They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today..
JODY: And the police did nothing?
MARGE: EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY. How could you?
JODY: How could you?
MARGE: I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
JODY: The word is Mob.
MARGE: I've regretted it ever since. Never run with the herd just because they're the herd.
JODY: Who were they?
MARGE: The men. Do any of them still live around here?
JODY: The men. Do any of them still live around here?
MARGE: Two men left town right after it happened.
JODY: You're not telling me something.
MARGE: Mr. Sisler was one of them.
JODY: ( shocked ) The principal?
MARGE: Who was the fourth?
JODY: Who was the fourth?
MARGE: God. It's like everything that was ever repressed in this town is suddenly bubbling up through the ground.
JODY: Her mother can't deny it any longer.
MARGE: Not a day has gone by where your for what happened. We both have.
JODY: Jody gets up.
NO!: Jody gets up.
MARGE: He dedicated his life to law enforcement after.

CARETAKER: I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.
BRENT: Can you get inside?
CARETAKER: I can.
BRENT: I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here.
CARETAKER: I don't give a fuck what your reasons are. You pay me ten dollars, you can go inside Otherwise, get a warrant.
KENNY: ( he kisses her ) Yes! You're here.

JODY: I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
KENNY: But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.

KENNY: That's not why we broke up.
JODY: You flaunt some slut in my face.
KENNY: Sharon's far from a slut.
JODY: And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.

JODY: LEONARD( O.C. ) You don't look OK.
JODY: ( starting to cry ) I am.
LEONARD: My house is just a couple of blocks away. Why don't you come on over and clean those cuts up.
JODY: Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
LEONARD: Can you just follow me? The back is full?
JODY: CUT TO: EXT. PARTY HOUSE Kids are still arriving from all over but there's no more room in the house so the party starts spilling out into the backyard. One couple spreads out on the roof. A cop car has pulled up in front and the deputy is just keeping a watch on the house.
LEONARD: You aren't going to the party?
JODY: You know about that too?
LEONARD: of COURSE. You're not scared?
JODY: Of course I'm scared.
LEONARD: Then you should go.
JODY: You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
LEONARD: I really do. For your own
JODY: I just feel so manipulated. By everyone. My dad, my boyfriend, and now some psychopath I don't even know.
LEONARD: We're all manipulated. From the moment we're born. The event that fatalistically shaped my life happened before I was even born.
JODY: Yes. We have no real freedom. You of all people should understand that. This may sting.
LEONARD: Yes. We have no real freedom. You of all people should understand that. This may sting.
JODY: Me? Why me?
LEONARD: Because of your father. The way what his sins shaped you.
JODY: What do you know about my father?
LEONARD: He's a rapist. Like mine.
JODY: ( a little scared )_ Your father raped someone?
LEONARD: Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
JODY: I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
LEONARD: I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
JODY: You're the killed.
LEONARD: Yes that's the whole point. This is what I was put on this earth to do. Rape the town that raped my mother. Steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers. I've planned this since I was a very little boy. You have no real freedom either. Your father has cast a shadow that you've never eluded.
MARK: You're so beautiful.
SANDY: So are you.
MARK: Now don't be nervous.
SANDY: You're the one who's hand is shaking.
NERD 2: Hey! That was a 3k machine.

BEN: He's all over her. She's into it too.
SHARON: You ok?
KENNY: Just thinking about something.
SHARON: There's going to be very few virgins left in school on Monday. It could be really dangerous for them if the killer isn't caught.
KENNY: There's going to be very few virgins left in school on Monday. It could be really dangerous for them if the killer isn't caught.

SHARON: I'm worried about someone.
KENNY: I'm worried about someone.
SHARON: You can't just leave me here.
BOY'S VOICE: Stay put Sharon. I'll hop on over when I'm done here.
GIRL'S VOICE: You will not!
KENNY: Jody was right, this party IS sick.
LEONARD: ( singing ) 'It's a family affair, It's a family affair.'
LEONARD: Well, we may be family One in four chance.
LEONARD: Sheriff Brent, you will be the second of the four horsemen of the apocalypse to die. But first you will watch as I slice up your little You're shaking too much. If you don't stop shaking Jody, I'll have to kill before I carve. We wouldn't want that.
LEONARD: You're shaking too much. If you don't stop shaking Jody, I'll have to kill before I carve. We wouldn't want that.
LEONARD: My mother said, after you and your three droogs raped her Brent, that people in town refused to let her use their bathrooms. Is that true? Did people really call her a slut and tell her 'you can't shit here'? She used to snarl that at me. That's all she really did, at least in my direction, was snarl. When she looked at me, she saw only you.
LEONARD: Open your eyes Brent. Watch. Or will I cause her much more pain.
KENNY: Hello? Jody?
LEONARD: Who the fuck is breaking into my house?
LEONARD: My wallet's on the mantle when you've finished your rifling,
KENNY: ( nervously ) Oh, hey Mr. Marliston. W-What's Jody's bike doing on your front porch?
LEONARD: That all depends Kenny. Depends on why the FUCK you've broken into your history teacher's house?
KENNY: Alright, Marliston, I know she's here.
LEONARD: What are you talking about? No one here but us chickens.
KENNY: That was Jody!
KENNY: Leonard moves towards Kenny with the razor. Kenny turns just in time. He grabs Leonard's arm as Leonard tries to slit his throat. They struggle. The door lock starts to shake as Brent continues to kick the door open from the other side. Leonard picks up a lamp with his free hand and smashes Kenny across the head. Kenny falls to the ground. The door pops open. Brent charges out. Leonard turns to him and slashes him across the chest as Brent sprays red paint in Leonard's eyes. Leonard screams, and lunges at Brent. Brent grabs Leonard. Using every ounce of energy he has, he throws Leonard down the basement stairs. Leonard grabs Brent as he tumbles down the stairs. The two roll to the bottom, smashing their heads along the way. As they come to a stop, Brent smashes his head hard on the floor. Leonard ends up on top of him. He raises the razor and slits Brent across the face.
BRENT: Jody run!
JODY: ( dying )
BRENT: ( dying )
JODY: My dad's down there!
KENNY: He's dead! We've got to get the fuck out of here!

JODY: Go to the police station!
KENNY: Deputy Webber's at the party. It's only three blocks away.
JODY: Fuck! It's him.
KENNY: Kenny helps Jody over the fence, then leaps up on it just as the German Shepard snaps at He jumps down on the other side, safe. The German Shepard smells something else and tears away.

JODY: Thanks for coming back for me.
KENNY: I love you.
OFFICER: ( no answer ) Come in Brent.
OFFICER: Jesus Christ had balls in his soup, Marliston, what'd you do, eat out a pizza or something? What the fuck happened to your face?
LEONARD: Hey, look, Elvis.
OFFICER: You really are a god damn rube. 'Family affair. Oh yes it's a family affair'.
LEONARD: You really are a god damn rube. 'Family affair. Oh yes it's a family affair'.
LEONARD: ( humming ) 'Family affair. Oh yes it's a family affair'.
JODY: Where are the police?
JODY: Oh GOD IT'S HIM!
KENNY: Quick! In the house. He won't look for us in there.
ANOTHER KID: Yeah. Get lost we're packed.
JODY: ( whispering ) What are you doing?

JIMMY: I was grounded for two fucking months because of you!
JODY: Jimmy leave him alone! He's Please get out of my way or I'll have to hurt you.

JIMMY: I knew you were a pervert. Always wearing those fucking doofy glasses, and driving a station wagon.
JODY: He's dangerous Jimmy!
JIMMY: So am I! I'm gonna rip your cock off
LEONARD: Leonard winds back, slashes at Jimmy, lopping off his dick. Blood flies up, splatters across Jimmy's face. Jimmy screams. Leonard slashes open his neck. Blood splatters everywhere, on kid's backs, faces, butts. His girlfriend screams as Jimmy falls to the ground, dying. Leonard begins to panic. So do the kids. Leonard sees Jody across the room and starts toward her as the other kids in the room rise to their feet and stampede the fuck out of dodge like a herd of frightened elephants.
JODY: Leonard starts slashing his way toward Jody. He slashes a girl across the stomach, a boy across the face, a girl across the breasts. It's a bloodbath, everyone's screaming. KIDS' bodies fall to the ground, tripping people, creating even more Leonard loses his balance and is pushed to the ground as kids stampede over him.
LEONARD: Come on! These are eighty dollar INDEPENDENT khakis! Limited Edition! God damn it!
JODY: Kenny tries to grab for her but he can't reach her. The force of the mob pushes him out the door, through the vortex.
KENNY: The staircase is now jammed with people, starts to buckle. The banister breaks. Kids start falling off the balcony and staircase, onto kids below, CRACKING SKULLS, breaking bones.
JODY: Please! You wouldn't kill your sister, would you?
LEONARD: You think you're my sister?
JODY: We have the same color eyes.
LEONARD: You're right. We do.
BOY 1: It's the freak!
GIRL 1: He's still got the blade!
BOY 3: Come on! It's fuck him up time!
KENNY: Come on. Lets get out of here.
LEONARD: J-Jody. P-please help me. It's all over now.
KENNY: It's all over now.
KENNY: ( smiling ) I'm all out of patience.
JODY: Oh God, this is the way it should be.
