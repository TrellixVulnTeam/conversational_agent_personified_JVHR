MR. STILLINGS: ( SQUINTING )
SINCLAIR: ( Following his boss's instructions, the "Some Kind Of Happiness" title back on the marquee ) Have you met her yet?
MR. STILLINGS: Not yet. But don't worry, Sinclair, I'll introduce you!
SINCLAIR: You promise? SINCLAIR smiles sneakily to himself as "Some Kind Of Happiness" logo fades out on marquee and "Written and Directed by John Waters" credit fades in.
SINCLAIR: ( EVILLY )
HONEY: Ah, what a town! HONEY is dressed for the premiere in an elegant evening gown and her black hair is cut perfectly in the Louise Brooks style that has become her signature. She continues her press conference under the watchful eyes of her press agent CHARLES and her long-time assistant LIBBY, both of whom are also dressed for the premiere. ROOM SERVICE employees stand by, ready to serve.
HONEY: I tell everybody in Hollywood, when you shoot on location in Baltimore, you don't need to bring all the crew from Los Angeles. Baltimore really ia the 5. Cut back to INTERIOR LOBBY OF SENATOR THEATER. 5. MR. STILLINGS lectures his other staff members as CATERERS and BARTENDERS set up behind him. SINCLAIR STEVENS is paying close attention as is LYLE, the projectionist, a handsome but surprisingly gaunt young man. CHERISH, a sexy and slightly nasty candy-counter girl leers at SINCLAIR who flirts back as she feigns interest in MR. STILLINGS' pep talk. PAM the popcorn girl, a masculine but beautiful nineteen year old with a seemingly bad attitude and LEWIS, the young cool African-American usher with a chip on his shoulder join FIDGET, RAVEN and DINAH.
MR. STILLINGS: and remember, Miss Whitlock is every inch a movie star and expects to be on stage at exactly 7:10pm to ensure live coverage from all three local news shows. By the way, I hear she's really a nice person.
HONEY: Look at this dump of a town! HONEY turns to her long suffering assistant, LIBBY. The press is gone and they are alone.
HONEY: Get me the fuck back to L.A. If one more asshole mentions a crab cake to me, I think I'll puke.
LIBBY: ( Trying to be positive ) Did you try the steamed crabs? They're red and.
HONEY: No I didn't! I'm not interested in any kind of meal you have to beat with a mallet. A knock is heard at hotel door.
HONEY: ( SUDDENLY NICE )
CHARLES: Your limousine is here, Miss Whitlock. You look beautiful.
HONEY: ( Back to being gracious ) Thank you Charles, darling. We'll be right with you. I'm excited. CHARLES exits.
HONEY: ( Back to her nasty self ) Do you think Pat Nixon got fucked in this hotel room?
LIBBY: ( STUPEFIED )
HONEY: It's called the "Presidential Suite" isn't it?
LIBBY: I BET SHE DID! Call the manager and ask him!
HONEY: I BET SHE DID! Call the manager and ask him!
LIBBY: ( HORRIFIED )
HONEY: It's your ï¿½ to ask, Libby! Call downstairs and find out if Pat Nixon got fucked in my hotel room! I want to know!
LIBBY: ( Reading from notes ) The hotel manager said "No." Pat Nixon never stayed here, but Nancy Reagen did in 1986.
HONEY: ( AMAZED )
LIBBY: ( CONFUSED )
HONEY: ( APPALLED )
LIBBY: Well. . .sort of. I mean you told me.
HONEY: I was kidding Libby. He must think you're a complete lunatic! Good God, you'd do anything! A HOTEL MAID pushing a cart of towels and bathroom supplies comes around a corner and is completely Good luck, Miss Whitlock! HONEY's face freezes in horror as elevator doors open and she is led inside.
MAID: Good luck, Miss Whitlock! HONEY's face freezes in horror as elevator doors open and she is led inside.
HONEY: ( In a sudden tirade ) Did you hear what that little bitch said to me?
LIBBY: She didn't know.
HONEY: In show business we say "break a leg." NEVER fucking "Good Luck"!
LIBBY: ( TO HONEY )
CHARLES: ( NERVOUSLY )
HONEY: That cocksucker put a curse on my whole fucking premiere! HOTEL GUESTS let out a cry of shock at HONEY's 10. INTERIOR HOTEL LOBBY. 10. MAYOR FENWICK, the middle aged African American mayor waits with the PRESS. HONEY steps off the elevator completely composed to a burst of flashbulbs.
HONEY: Mayor Fenwick! LIBBY and CHARLES look to one another relieved as HOTEL GUESTS stumble out of elevator, shaking their heads in disgust.
MAYOR: Miss Whitlock, what an honor! They pose together as PRESS snaps away.
HONEY: I love what you've done with this city.
MAYOR: And Baltimore loves you back! ( Takes out proclamation ) I, Adam Fenwick, Mayor of the City of Baltimore, do hereby proclaim April 29th to be Honey Whitlock Day in Maryland and do command this observation to all of our citizens. Whereas.
PETIE: ( Looking at watch and sneakily speaking into walkie-talkie ) A star is born.
SINCLAIR: ( Whispering into walkie ) 10-4, Petie. SINCLAIR nods gravely to LYLE the projectionist who picks up a 35mm metal film can and sneaks up behind MR. STILLINGS who is looking down from projection booth to the premiere CROWD filling the theater below.
MR. STILLINGS: Christ, there's what's-her-name from E Network. Look at the tits on her! LYLE hits MR. STILLINGS over the head with the film ( In full command, over walkie,

LIBBY: The charity probably made the arrangements. It was an innocent mistake.
HONEY: ( GOING BALLISTIC )
MAYOR: ( Stepping into black limo, ) Break a leg, Miss Whitlock! RODNEY, in a panic, keeps checking his watch.
RODNEY: Excuse me, ma'am, but Security's gonna have my ass if we're late.

The audience breaks into big applause as LITTLE WILLIAM pales in stage fright and resentment.
MRS. MALLORY: ( At podium, into microphone ) Good evening, I'm Sylvia Mallory, Chairman of the Maryland Heart Fund and this is Little William. LITTLE WILLIAM glares sullenly at audience, unhappy to be there.
MRS. MALLORY: Little William had heart surgery just seven days ago and thanks to the blood transfusion paid for by your generosity at tonight's premiere, he's going to be alright, aren't you, Little William?
LITTLE WILLIAM: ( SULLENLY )
MRS. MALLORY: ( To AUDIENCE as she tries to hug him ) Little William's a little grumpy.
LITTLE WILLIAM: ( Snatching away her hands, under his breath ) Get off me, ugly.
MRS. MALLORY: ( TO AUDIENCE )
MRS. MALLORY: And now the moment you've been waiting for! You first saw Honey Whitlock on the screen as the lovely ingenue turned vixen in "Good For Nothing".
LYLE: ( INTO WALKIE )
MRS. MALLORY: .and from then on it's been hit after hit. LITTLE WILLIAM kicks MRS. MALLORY in leg behind the podium where AUDIENCE can't see.
MRS. MALLORY: ( Grimacing in pain ) .after hit. LITTLE WILLIAM smiles at her sadistically. MRS. MALLORY tries to inch away from LITTLE WILLIAM who sneakily continues to kick her.

HONEY WHITLOCK!: 34. INTERIOR THEATER. 34. Wide shot of audience erupting in applause and craning their necks as HONEY is led down right aisle to stage by SINCLAIR and RODNEY the bodyguard, LIBBY and CHARLES applaud from their seats. MAYOR stands and applauds. HONEY smiles radiantly as she passes life-size promotional cut-out of herself in aisle. Cut to reverse side of cut-out and we see CHERISH ready to light the fuse of a molotov cocktail. MRS. MALLORY applauds wildly from stage. FIDGET starts playing pocket pool in nervous excitement. MAYOR glares at FIDGET in prudish LITTLE WILLIAM sneers at HONEY's approach with 35. SENATOR STAGE. 35. SINCLAIR grabs oversized prop check made out to Maryland Heart Fund for $75,000 from the wings and carries it on stage as RODNEY the bodyguard escorts HONEY to the podium. HONEY shakes hands with MRS. MALLORY and bends down to give LITTLE WILLIAM a kiss for the PHOTOGRAPHERS. LITTLE WILLIAM grimaces and wipes off her kiss with disgust before kicking MRS. MALLORY one last time.
HONEY: ( INTO MICROPHONE )
HONEY: I LOVE YOU, BALTIMORE! I REALLY DO! SINCLAIR throws down prop check and pulls a MAC 10 gun HONEY's head.
SINCLAIR: I AM CECIL B. DEMENTED!. ( Rips off his short-haired wig to reveal bleached

PETIE: ( TO GANG )
SUBURBAN LADY: Sinclair, is that you? PETIE turns down radio and GANG freezes.
CECIL: ( Suddenly turning into his old self ) Hi, Mrs. Waltrup.
SUBURBAN LADY: Did you win the lottery?
CECIL: ( POLITELY )
SUBURBAN LADY: I don't go to the movies much, I wait for the video.
CECIL: Not me, I like the big screen.
SUBURBAN LADY: Say hello to your mom and dad for me.
CECIL: I sure will. SUBURBAN LADY makes right on red and pulls off.
CECIL: ( Smugly, to GANG ) Casting has been completed! PETIE peels out in other direction. 53. Cut to EXTERIOR "SPROCKET HOUSE," a run-down, 53. seemingly abandoned warehouse in an industrial part of t:he city. The moon is full and the quiet is interrupted by faint sirens in the distance. Suddenly, like a low-rent Bat Cave, the large industrial garage doors swing open and the white limo speeds inside. 54. Dissolve to INTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE. HONEY's 54. "dressing room"; a bizarrely decorated prison cell fit for a movie queen. HONEY is blindfolded, gagged and tied to a director's chair with her name printed on the back, still wearing her torn and soiled premiere gown. LEWIS, now dressed in terrorist punk outfit removes HONEY's blindfold and gag as she sputters in terror. We see LEWIS has D-A-V-I-D L-Y-N-C-H tattooed on his HONEY's e yes light up in terror as she sees CECIL, now attired in insane grunge Cecil B. DeMille inspired outfit being lowered by PETIE on jerry-rigged film crane. "Otto Preminger" is tattooed on CECIL's bicep.
CECIL: .Hello, I'm Cecil B. DeMented and I'm your new director. HONEY stares in confused horror.
CECIL: I'd like you to meet your co-stars .I call them the "Sprocket Holes." HONEY looks over in fear as the SPROCKET HOLES, now changed from their theater uniforms into their own scary "terrorist chic" fashions, gather around CECIL in a "crew-shot from hell" pose.
CECIL: This is Cherish. CHERISH, now heavily made-up and dressed "riot-girl" style, in a "SINEMA" T-shirt, steps forward. We see "Andy Warhol" tattooed on her thigh.
CHERISH: Hi, I played you in lots of porno movies. "Some Kind Of Happiness"? I've already shot it - only it's called "Some Kind Of Horniness."
CECIL: LYLE takes a big huff of glue in plastic bag and steps forward. He is dressed in scarily in 1970's junky wear meets 90's Hollywood sleaze, and sports a "Herschell Gordon Lewis" tattoo across his skinny chest.
LYLE: Hi, I'm Lyle and I'm your leading man. I've had a boner for you for years. HONEY pales.
CECIL: ( Getting off crane and stepping towards HONEY ) Don't worry, we've all taken a vow of celibacy for celluloid. No one gets laid until we've finished our movie. We're horny. CHERISH starts writhing sexily.
CECIL: .but our film comes first. CECIL gently shoves her away as SPROCKET HOLES undulate in sexual frustration.
CECIL: .And now for the crew. PAM the popcorn girl swaggers over carrying a beat-up vintage 16mm movie camera and aims it at HONEY's face. She is wearing a black para-military jump suit and we
PAM: I'm Pam, the director of photography and you'd better hit your mark! CHARDONNAY, now done up in outrageous homegirl gangster look, carries an old wrecked Nagra sound recorder and spins her microphone boom pole like lethal numchucks before raising it over HONEY's head, revealing the "Spike Lee" tattoo on her stomach.
CHARDONNAY: .and remember - SPEAK UP, BITCH! I'm Chardonnay and I do the sound. LEWIS proudly steps forward, menacingly holding staple gun like a weapon.
LEWIS: We met. I'm Lewis, the art director. I hope you'll be comfortable here. HONEY looks around cell and sees giant stills blown up from her past films showing her in physical and emotional distress.
LEWIS: ( MOVING CLOSER ) ( BASHFUL )
FIDGET: ( BASHFUL )
RAVEN: Hi, I'm Raven and I'm a Satanist. I'll be doing your makeup. HONEY stares back in confusion.
RAVEN: You look so pale. RAVEN suddenly slaps HONEY across face and HONEY cries out in shock.
RAVEN: Sorry. but Satan says. you need color! RODNEY, the biker "bodyguard," now in S&M leather get-up steps toward HONEY carrying a rat-tail comb and a hair dye applicator bottle. His "Almodovar" tattoo is a beauty.
RODNEY: Call me Rodney. Tomorrow I'm bleaching your hair out platinum and I should warn you.I FUCKING HATE ROOTS! PETIE, the sexy hillbilly "chauffeur," now dressed in redneck militant garb and featuring a "Fassbinder" tattoo, steps forward.
PETIE: Hey, I'm Petie, remember me, "the trailer trash"? I'll be your driver. I'll take you anywhere. anywhere but home!! ( Laughs evilly as he
DINAH: ( Snarling to HONEY ) I'm Dinah, Cecil's prodÂ»cer and I do everything! I've been knocking down box office money from every big Hollywood hit for years to pay for this

Sylvia Mallory, the fifty-two year old chairwoman of the Maryland Heart Fund died tonight at Union Memorial Hospital following an on stage heart attack she suffered in the middle of Honey Whitlock's kidnapping at tonight's Baltimore movie SPROCKET HOLES stare in amazement at TV screen, the enormity of their act barely sinking in.
NEWSMAN: .the teenage gang of cinema terrorists who apparently infiltrated the staff of the Senator Theater are now eligible for the death penalty in the State of Maryland. CECIL nods to DINAH to turn it off, which she does. SPROCKET HOLES gulp and look to their leader for CECIL steps forward, getting right in HONEY's terrified face.
CECIL: Miss Whitlock, we're going to make our first film and NOBODY'S going to stop us. Lots of kids dream of making a movie. SPROCKET HOLES smile in brain-washed enthusiasm.
CECIL: .but only the ones willing to dia for it succeed. HONEY looks into CECIL's face and lets out a sob of 55. Fade in to EXTERIOR "SPROCKET HOUSE." Next morning. 55.
HONEY: ( TO RODNEY )
RODNEY: You're going right off the deep end of the Clairol color chart! RODNEY squirts on more dye.
HONEY: It's burning my scalp! Ow! Ow! Ow!
RODNEY: Beauty comes from agony! Everyone knows that!
RAVEN: I haven't had this much fun since my last livestock mutilation. RAVEN lunges towards HONEY's eyebrows and painfully tweezes out a hair.
HONEY: Oh God! That really hurt!
RAVEN: "In the House of Pain, there
RODNEY: Let's wash it out! RODNEY yanks HONEY's head back as RAVEN pours scalding water over her head.

FIDGET: I HATE THESE FUCKING THINGS! CECIL enters with HONEY as RODNEY and RAVEN follow, continuing torturing HONEY by blow-drying her hair with malfunctioning, smoking hair dryer and curling her eyelashes with rusty curlers.

CECIL: ( To HONEY, ever the

HONEY: ( Muttering, furious ) The Screen Actors Guild will hear about this and I mean it! HONEY lets gown fall to floor and steps out of it. She is wearing beautiful lingerie.

LYLE: ( Entering in character ) Hey, Cherish, it's 8:00. Am I supposed to get this show on the screen or what!?

CECIL: That's more like it, Miss Whitlock! CHERISH gives HONEY a suddenly jealous look.
HONEY: ( Feeling her oats ) To be frank, Cecil, I would never do this picture in my real film life. The whole message is stupid - ask theater owners in any country and they'll tell you. Hollywood makes the best films in the world and I'm proud to be part of that system.

HONEY: ( SHOCKED )
CECIL: The first take is the only real truth.
HONEY: But you can't cut the film with only a master!
