FINAL CELL: A gaunt PRISONER kneels on the granite, head bowed to a wall hung tapestry of Christ. But he's not just praying. He's digging. With his arm under the tapestry, he scratches at the stone with a SPOON. After only a year, the spoon finally breaks through.

JOHN: centers on a drapery ROPE, pulls hard. Drapery HOOKS EXPLODE off the curtain rod as he swings open the window, looks down into the alley where that yellow taxi is CHAZ ( 20s ) looks up from his cab. Cool. Frustrated. You just know he'd love to be up there, not down here.

JOHN: Amar natash bow basar! rescind from the flesh I command thee!

HENNESSEY: Now about the fee.
HENNESSEY: Thank you. Yes. Gracias.
JOHN: Hennessey stops his panhandling, continues toward the INT. FOYER John and Hennessey stop near the front entrance. John rips the white collar from Hennessey's neck.
HENNESSEY: I know, I know, but I didn't think she was really possessed, not like I'm not back an hour and you drag me into
JOHN: I'm not back an hour and you drag me into

JOHN: I should take it all, save you from yourself.
HENNESSEY: It keeps them out, so I can sleep. Please, John, I need to sleep.
JOHN: I told you to move it.
CHAZ: Well maybe if you had told me you were dropping a three-hundred pound mirror with a pissed-off demon in it I would have moved it
CHAZ: Well what?
JOHN: Well what?
CHAZ: Shouldn't have cut your stay in the land of enlightenment. You were so close to growing a
JOHN: Los Angeles.
JOHN: Never ceases to entertain.
ANGELA: The MAN is thirty feet down the same track. Their VOICES ECHO off the curved walls, come from everywhere. How either of these two got here isn't important. Who will get out is.
ANGELA: Put your weapon on the tracks and step out with your hands above your head.
ANGELA: That's just not going to happen.
ANGELA: ( almost pleading ) Now put down your weapon on the tracks and
TAXI TRUNK: OPENS, REVEALS suitcases stamped with AIR INDIA. John starts inside, pauses as Chaz yells
CHAZ: There are four bags. I have two hands. This give you any ideas?
JOHN: Make two trips?
CHAZ: ( yells across room ) Simple question. How much longer do I have to be your slave?
JOHN: You're not my slave, Chaz. You're my very appreciated assistant. Like Tonto and Robin and that skinny fellow with the fat friend. How much longer?
CHAZ: How much longer?
JOHN: Well I don't know, what's the going rate for saving a taxi driver hanging from his fingernails about to be swallowed into the jaws of Hell?
CHAZ: So what time you want me back? I need to make an appearance at Midnite's. Say ten-ish?
JOHN: I need to make an appearance at Midnite's. Say ten-ish?
JOHN: Chaz turns back, catches an object John throws him.
JOHN: A little something from Delphi.
CHAZ: Gee, thanks.
BEEMAN: I gave you three months worth. You were gone only one.
JOHN: What can I say, Beeman, India was a real drain.
BEEMAN: So what do you need?
JOHN: Everything you got.
BEEMAN: ( pausing ) You smell something, John?
JOHN: Maybe. Incubus in this girl I just exorcized seemed a bit more spirited than usual.
BEEMAN: Well, I've got your stone fragments from the Road to Damascus, dust from the Dead Sea Scrolls oh, you'll love this
BEEMAN: Screech beetle from Mount Sinai.
BEEMAN: Yeah, to you it's nothing but to the Fallen like fingernails on a chalkboard.
JOHN: What is it with you and bugs?
BEEMAN: Gold was blessed by the Bishop Anicott during the Crusades.
BEEMAN: Watch it there.
BEEMAN: Dragon's breath.
JOHN: I thought you couldn't get it
BEEMAN: Whoa, don't want to get a flame near this. Piece of the shroud Moses wore to the mountain.
JOHN: Got any callinicus?
BEEMAN: ( intrigued ) How spirited was this incubus?
JOHN: ( coughs ) Like it was trying to come right out through the girl
JOHN: I know how it sounds.
BEEMAN: We're finger puppets to them, John, elaborate costumes they can work us but don't come through us. They can't. You know that.
JOHN: Check the scrolls anyway. Corinthians. See if there are any Sure, John. Anything else?
BEEMAN: Sure, John. Anything else?
JOHN: ( coughs again ) Wouldn't happen to have anything
BEEMAN: On the house.
ANGELA: Gutsy? Well that's a new one.
WEISS: You're alive. Bad guy's dead. No point in using the other words.
ANGELA: ( shuts his locker ) Even though it was reckless irresponsible stupid.
WEISS: ( shuts his locker ) Even though it was reckless irresponsible stupid.
ANGELA: I knew you still cared.
WEISS: You're good, Angela, real good but one of these days.
ANGELA: ( heard it before ) I know, nobody's luck lasts
JOHN: Two frogs on a bench.
CHAZ: Two frogs on a bench.
CHAZ: What? But I'm with him! Right, John? John?
NICO: Neighborhood's going to Hell.
JOHN: Numquam leadatur a morsu.
JOHN: Bastard changed the code again. Midnite! Come on, do I have to huff and puff here?!
JOHN: Deciding which color to paint this place again?
MIDNITE: You're back early.
JOHN: I got tired of spending your But I'm sure you spent enough.
MIDNITE: But I'm sure you spent enough.
JOHN: Well I do have a certain standard of living.
MIDNITE: Tell me you found it.
JOHN: I found the vault.
MIDNITE: That's not what I asked.
JOHN: Hey, can I help it if Buddhist monks don't take bribes?
JOHN: A reluctant grin cracks Midnite's stern features. He takes the relic in his thick fingers stares breathlessly at a gaunt figure bracing itself against a cosmic wind.
MIDNITE: Second century depiction of a sephiroth in the 4th realm.
JOHN: Right. So we good here?
MIDNITE: It should counter the iconic That damn thing's never going to
JOHN: That damn thing's never going to
MIDNITE: Must I remind you of what selling fake relics will do to your It's authentic, Midnite, you just have the wrong piece. Jesus.
JOHN: It's authentic, Midnite, you just have the wrong piece. Jesus.
JOHN: What? I didn't blink that was a cough. You never cough?
JOHN: Better not be any Washingtons in here this time.
MIDNITE: Why did you cut your trip short?
JOHN: I don't know. Just a feeling
JOHN: Balthazar is behind him. Utterly confident. Chillingly John's attempt to disguise his anger fails.
BALTHAZAR: We're not still whining about Manhattan, are we?
BALTHAZAR: That expression alone has made my entire night.
JOHN: I'll make your night I'll deport your sorry ass right where you stand
MIDNITE: John stops in his tracks.
JOHN: It's bad enough that you let these half-breeds in at all but this piece of shit
BALTHAZAR: Perks of becoming a primary
JOHN: Midnite's eyes say it all not here, not now.
BALTHAZAR: Things change, balances shift. Get used to it, Constantine.
JOHN: Not while I'm still breathing
BALTHAZAR: I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.
HENNESSEY: Hey, John.
HENNESSEY: I'm real sorry about this morning, John, real sorry. Please don't hate me for draggin' you into that. Please don't.
JOHN: I don't hate you.
HENNESSEY: That's good to hear. Real good.
JOHN: But could you at least wait until I call for you before you show up?
HENNESSEY: You didn't call?
JOHN: Not yet. Jesus, Hennessey, you freak me out sometimes.
HENNESSEY: So you want me to go away and come No. I've got an assignment for you.
JOHN: No. I've got an assignment for you.
HENNESSEY: Really? What kind of assignment?
JOHN: The kind you'll have to be sober Oh God, you want me to surf the
HENNESSEY: Oh God, you want me to surf the
JOHN: Come on, you know that exorcism wasn't right.
HENNESSEY: I. I don't have the Sight Don't have it or don't want to use
JOHN: Don't have it or don't want to use
JOHN: Just look around. A few days. You spot anything unusual, anything you let me know.
JOHN: It'll be like old times. Just for a few days.
JOHN: Just for a few days.
HENNESSEY: Okay, okay. for you, John. Like old times. Right.
ANGELA: I killed a man today. Another
FATHER GARRET: I'm sorry, Angela.
ANGELA: Most cops go twenty years without firing their gun. Not me. I always seem to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.
COURTYARD: where it SHATTERS
DAY: Angela is led by Detective Weiss past several officers and medical personnel.
WEISS: It's Isabel.
ANGELA: She. she fell from the roof?
WEISS: No. She jumped.
WEISS: I know it's hard to accept but
ANGELA: Isabel would never in a million years take her own life. Never.
WEISS: Angela. there was a surveillance camera on the roof.
WIDER: Angela shudders as a comforting HAND rests on her Angela brushes off his hand, then spots Weiss and the others on the other side of the room. Whose hand was INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE A LINE OF LIGHT BOXES illuminate several CHEST X-RAYS. A DARK sinister splotch snakes through both LUNGS. John stands there, stares at this wall of death with disbelief.
JOHN: No I've beaten things, insurmountable things, things most people have never even heard of and after all that you think I'm going to be done in by THIS?
DR. ARCHER: You wouldn't be the first, John.
JOHN: It can't be that simple. I mean come on, Les, you saved me before. You can do it again, right.
DR. ARCHER: This is different. This is
DR. ARCHER: Twenty years ago you didn't want to be here. Now you don't want to That's because I know exactly where I'm going this time.
JOHN: That's because I know exactly where I'm going this time.
ANGELA: ( rushing toward it ) Wait, hold the door!
ANGELA: Going down?
JOHN: Not if I can help it.
ELLIE: That's funny as shit, John.
JOHN: As if you guys didn't have something to do with it.
ELLIE: Hey, I think you brought this one on yourself.
ELLIE: Now why wouldn't you trust me?
JOHN: I don't know, something in the
ELLIE: Don't worry, John, you'll beat this. You beat everything.
JOHN: Not this time, Ellie.
ELLIE: Oh wow, you're serious. No wonder the Boss is in such a good Yeah, I thought maybe you could talk to him for me. You know.?
JOHN: Yeah, I thought maybe you could talk to him for me. You know.?
ELLIE: What?! Dammit, John, I know I owe you but to even ASK that? All those saints and martyrs slipping through his grasp his own foot soldiers sent back to him in chunks. He's going to take all that out on you, John, and he's going to enjoy ripping your soul to shreds until the end of time.
JOHN: So I take that as a 'no?'
ELLIE: You're the one soul the man himself would actually come up here to collect. And you know how much he despises this place.
JOHN: I'm starting to see his point.
ELLIE: Have you gone to see the Snob?
ELLIE: Look, don't let your ego get in the way on this. I'd miss having someone up here I can. relate
JOHN: I'm sure I can get you in here.
CHAZ: INT. THEOLOGICAL SOCIETY - LATER A few bishops talk quietly. A cardinal studies Scriptures. Definitely not the place for atheists. John walks through the vaulted chamber room to the
LIBRARY: John stops, fixes on the two gentlemen standing in front of a fireplace. One is a young man of pure class wrapped in Armani's best. The other is Father Garret. John stands to the side and waits for their conversation to end. An ATTENDANT makes the rounds.
ATTENDANT: Can I take your coat, Mr. No thanks, I'm not staying long.
JOHN: No thanks, I'm not staying long.
ATTENDANT: How about you, ma'am?
ANGELA: I'm not staying long either.
ANGELA: My business with him is urgent.
JOHN: First come, first served.
ANGELA: So you're rude no matter where you
FATHER GARRET: and Angela have retreated to another area for privacy.
ANGELA: Why is he stalling on this? My sister needs a Catholic funeral.
FATHER GARRET: Angela, it's still considered a mortal sin
ANGELA: She didn't commit suicide.
FATHER GARRET: The Bishop has read otherwise.
ANGELA: Father. David this is Isabel.
FATHER GARRET: I'll talk to him again.
GABRIEL: ( without looking back ) I know what you want, son.
JOHN: Been keeping your all-seeing eye on me, have you?
GABRIEL: I could offer how a shepherd leads even the most wayward of his flock but it might sound disingenuous.
JOHN: So you're going to make me beg?
GABRIEL: It wouldn't help. You've already wasted your chance at redemption.
JOHN: What about the minions I've sent back, the souls that I've saved that should guarantee my passage No passage requires faith and faith by definition is belief without proof. You have proof. And that means you're not playing by the same rules as everyone else. Your work has mostly been for selfish reasons. I'm sorry.
GABRIEL: ( keeping it private ) No passage requires faith and faith by definition is belief without proof. You have proof. And that means you're not playing by the same rules as everyone else. Your work has mostly been for selfish reasons. I'm sorry.
JOHN: This is bullshit bullshit!
JOHN: It's like you've got some cosmic scale weighing everything we do help an old lady across the street put in a nickel, kick a dog, take out a dime you're fucking nickel and diming us to death down here!
GABRIEL: Keep your voice down.
JOHN: And you know what, you're the ones with the problem, not us You make these impossible rules to decide who goes up, who goes down and you don't even understand us
GABRIEL: Each of you is born with the promise of salvation preordained. The cost of your redemption is simple belief. And yet you whine about impossible rules. Sometimes I imagine you hardly deserve the gift you have been given.
JOHN: Gift?! More like a curse the way you manage things.
GABRIEL: I am taking your situation into account, John, but don't push me.
JOHN: Why me, Gabriel? It's personal, isn't it? I didn't go to church enough? I didn't pray enough? I was five bucks short in the collection plate? Why?
GABRIEL: You're going to die because you smoked 30 cigarettes a day since you were 15. And you're going to Hell because of the life you took. Or to put it in a way that your kind would understand. You're fucked.
JOHN: He has a rotten sense of humor. And his punch lines are killers.
CHAZ: ( shouting out ) John? It's raining! Hey!
OLD MAN: ( coughs ) We gotta stick together, right?
ANGELA: I'm sorry, Isabel.
JOHN: A few months, maybe a year. That's it. End of story. Game Well, don't break down on my What do you want from me? A shoulder to cry on?
MIDNITE: What do you want from me? A shoulder to cry on?
JOHN: This bastard attacked me right out in the open on Sepulveda no They don't like you, John. You've deported how many back to Hell?
MIDNITE: They don't like you, John. You've deported how many back to Hell?
JOHN: That's just it this wasn't some possession or wayward half breed, it was a full-fledged demon. Here. On our plane.
MIDNITE: I know what I saw.
JOHN: I know what I saw.
MIDNITE: You must have just crossed over and didn't even realize it
JOHN: I didn't cross over It was on this side. Here.
MIDNITE: it's wet out, you're wandering around aimlessly, not to mention completely emotional
JOHN: John slams a fist against the counter. The orrery almost topples but Midnite saves it. Decades of work almost Midnite glares at a desperate John.
MIDNITE: Okay, so you saw something. We've seen a few small ones slip through now and then.
JOHN: It's more than that. first the girl, then this.
MIDNITE: John, you know my connections. Any shifts or tremors in the planes and I'd hear about it.
JOHN: Something's coming.
BRIEF CLOSEUPS: Of specific words in a few HEADLINES "Occult activity on the rise." "Claimed possession is refuted by Bishop." "Satanic cult dissolved." Accompanies with an assortment of unusual case photos. BLOOD PATTERNS on a WALL Odd SYMBOLS burned into a ceiling. A cross burnt to a crisp. JOHN in handcuffs looking back at a mother holding her son in her arms. A younger and more noble Father Hennessey stands beside them, looking grateful.
ANGELA: L.A.P.D. This is Dodson, hello?
MYSTERIOUS POV: Watching the Prisoner. He looks back AT us, suspicious. Nothing there.
PRISONER: looks back nervously, as his bag goes through the DETECTOR SCREEN shows the folds of the bag, a wallet, a passport and nothing else. The iron relic doesn't even produce an Bag slides out, untouched. Prisoner can't believe his luck, grabs the bag and walks on toward the gates.
DETECTOR SCREEN: shows the folds of the bag, a wallet, a passport and nothing else. The iron relic doesn't even produce an Bag slides out, untouched. Prisoner can't believe his luck, grabs the bag and walks on toward the gates.
JOHN: Welcome to my life.
ANGELA: I saw you at
JOHN: I remember.
ANGELA: ( CONTINUED )
JOHN: ( CONTINUED )
ANGELA: I'd like to ask you a few I'm not really in the talking mood right now.
JOHN: I'm not really in the talking mood right now.
ANGELA: Could you just listen then?
ANGELA: Always a catch.
JOHN: Always a catch.
ANGELA: My sister was murdered last week.
JOHN: Sorry to hear.
ANGELA: Her name was Isabel. Isabel
ANGELA: You don't remember her?
JOHN: Never met her.
ANGELA: You sure?
JOHN: She look anything like you? I would've remembered.
ANGELA: She was a patient at Ravenscar. Then last Tuesday she just decided to step off the roof.
JOHN: I thought you said she was murdered?
ANGELA: Isabel would never take her own life.
JOHN: You'd be surprised at what people will do.
ANGELA: Look, I know I'm not making much sense hell I'm not really sure what I'm doing here. I just feel the circles you travel in the occult, demonology,
ANGELA: I believe someone got to her, Mr. Constantine, brainwashed her into stepping off that roof. Some kind of legion or cult.
JOHN: Sounds like a theory. Good luck.
ANGELA: Well I thought with your background and experience, you could at least point me in the right direction.
JOHN: Yeah, okay. Sure.
ANGELA: My sister always talked about a world better than this. Heaven as some call it. She wasn't afraid of dying because she knew it was waiting for her. What everyone fails to grasp is that if she had really taken her own life
JOHN: she would have committed a mortal sin and her soul would have gone straight to Hell where it would never feel love or compassion or anything but pain again as the master himself rips her apart over and over for the rest of eternity. That about right?
ANGELA: You're not the only one afraid of
JOHN: Oh shit.
JOHN: How open is your mind?
JOHN: Do you believe in Heaven and Hell? How about what comes out of each?
JOHN: You mean like angels?
ANGELA: You mean like angels?
JOHN: And demons.
JOHN: See, you don't have the mindset for this kind of work.
ANGELA: Look, I see terrible things every day. A mother drowns her baby. A ten-year-old shoots his father. But it's not demons, it's the evil that men do.
JOHN: You're right, we're capable of terrible things but we usually justify it with motives like money and power and jealousy.
JOHN: Then sometimes, something comes along and gives us just the right nudge and we do truly evil things just for the kick of it.
ANGELA: I don't believe in demons.
JOHN: You should. They believe in us.
JOHN: We should go.
JOHN: Angela's confusion turns to tension as a raspy guttural WIND races toward them. John jerks her into action. They run towards the next light. It blinks out right when they reach it. They race to stay in the light, aiming toward the safety of the brightly-lit statue of the Good Shepherd.
ANGELA: What is that?
JOHN: John rummages through his trench coat fishes out that cloth Beeman gave him. The one supposedly wrapped around The cross is getting dimmer and dimmer.
ANGELA: John rummages through his trench coat fishes out that cloth Beeman gave him. The one supposedly wrapped around The cross is getting dimmer and dimmer.
JOHN: And maybe talons.
ANGELA: Are you kidding? Of what?
JOHN: Something that's not supposed to be here.
JOHN: Close your eyes.
ANGELA: Suit yourself.
JOHN: Suit yourself.
JOHN: ( to himself ) 'I accidentally crossed over?' I don't think so.
ANGELA: ( coming up behind ) What was that? I saw wings and teeth they were flying. What the hell were those things?!
JOHN: They weren't angels.
JOHN: Seplavites, actually. Scavengers for the damned. What? You can't be serious. this is impossible.
ANGELA: What? You can't be serious. this is impossible.
JOHN: ( to himself ) And I don't think they were after
JOHN: You really believe she wouldn't commit suicide?
ANGELA: ( a bit thrown ) My sister? ( a beat ) Never in a million years.
JOHN: Let's be sure.
ANGELA: Simple. See if she's in Hell.
JOHN: Simple. See if she's in Hell.
ANGELA: These are all Isabel's things.
JOHN: The cat too?
ANGELA: Yeah, why.?
ANGELA: Don't you need candles and a pentagram for this to work?
JOHN: ( deadpan ) Why, do you have any?
JOHN: I need you to step outside now.
JOHN: Angela? Please.
JOHN: Is she here?
JOHN: Is she here?!
JOHN: IS SHE HERE?!
JOHN: It's a simple question! Is she here or not?!!
JOHN: She lifts something and tosses it. John watches as a small object tumbles toward him just ahead of closing INT. ANGELA'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY In that same motion we left her in Angela finishes pushing the door closed. As it LATCHES
ANGELA: John? What happened?
ANGELA: How? How did you do this.?
JOHN: She leaves. Angela sits across from him. They're at the table by the window.
JOHN: My parents sent me to a doctor, a shrink, a priest. I was in four different institutions by the time I was eighteen.
JOHN: The last place they put me was run by a church.
JOHN: So I took things into my own hands and I found a way out.
ANGELA: You attempted suicide.
JOHN: I never attempt anything.
ANGELA: But you're still here. Alive.
JOHN: Not my doing.
SECURITY GUARD: Hey, what're you doing in here?
RING: Be there, John. please.
HENNESSEY: Be there, John. please.
MAITRE D': Sir, you need a reservation! But the worst demons are the ones that are allowed to be here the ones that are half-human so they blend in.
JOHN: So when one of them gets a little cocky, peddles their influence or hijacks a soul I deport their scaly ass right back to Hell. I don't get them all but maybe enough to insure my retirement.
ANGELA: Sounds like you're trying to buy your way into Heaven.
JOHN: Well, what would you do if you were sentenced to a prison where half the inmates were put there by
ANGELA: Why you? I mean many go to Hell, why were you able to escape?
JOHN: ( sips tea ) I don't know.
ANGELA: God has a plan for all of us.
JOHN: Not for me.
ANGELA: Isabel saw things too.
ANGELA: Detective Dodson here.
WEISS: He comes over here, makes a run at the entire menu and pow deflates like a fricken Macy's day Why didn't you call me, you fat sonna bitch.
JOHN: ( sympathetic ) Why didn't you call me, you fat sonna bitch.
JOHN: ( to Hennessey ) Rest in peace, Father.
ANGELA: She'd tell everyone about things she said she saw. Crazy things. Things that hadn't happened yet. She'd scare my mother to death, talking on and on about Revelations and the end of the world. Then one day she just stopped. never said another So you put her in here.
JOHN: So you put her in here.
JOHN: Show me her room.
NURSE: He runs right into Angela's arms, hugs her tight. Angela is totally baffled. John is thoroughly intrigued.
NURSE: Oh God.
NURSE: No, Barry, that's not Isabel.
NURSE: I'm sorry. They were friends. He kind of had a crush on your sister.
JOHN: You were twins.
JOHN: So how long?
ANGELA: Two months. This time.
ANGELA: I already did all that.
ANGELA: Now you're insulting me.
JOHN: You don't walk off a building without leaving something behind.
ANGELA: You saw everything she left behind. In that box.
JOHN: Maybe she left something else. Something more personal. Just for
JOHN: You were her twin, Angela. Twins tend to think alike.
ANGELA: I'm not like my sister.
JOHN: But you were at once time. When you were kids. When you'd spend every waking hour with each other. You'd start a sentence, she'd finish it. You'd get hurt, she'd That was a long time ago.
ANGELA: That was a long time ago.
JOHN: That kind of bond doesn't just There's nothing here.
ANGELA: There's nothing here.
JOHN: She planned her death in this room, she thought it up right where you're standing
JOHN: She knew you'd come She counted on you to see what she saw, to feel what she felt to do what she did. What did she do, Angela?
ANGELA: How should I know?
JOHN: What did she do, Angela?
ANGELA: I don't know!
JOHN: What would you do?
JOHN: What would you leave her? What would it be? Where would it be?! Where would it be?
ANGELA: The tree.
ANGELA: ( trying to There must have been a tree in our backyard. when we were kids.
JOHN: 'COR 14:01.' There is no 14h act in Corinthians.
ANGELA: ( CONTINUED )
JOHN: ( CONTINUED )
ANGELA: ( shaking her head ) There is no 14h act in Corinthians.
JOHN: I need a church.
JOHN: Corinthians goes to 21 acts in the book of Ethenius. It's like a dark mirror of the Bible. It paints a different view of Revelations, says that the world will not come to an end at the hand of God but be reborn in the embrace of the damned.
ANGELA: There's a difference?
JOHN: Depends on which side of the fence you're standing.
ANGELA: So why haven't I seen this book Because it doesn't exist here on this side.
JOHN: Because it doesn't exist here on this side.
BOIL: ANGELA ( O.S. )
REGULAR CHAPEL: not here on this side?
ANGELA: not here on this side?
ANGELA: Where did that come from?
JOHN: ( stopping to read ) 13:29. 13:30 Here. Corinthians 14:01. ( skimming to this ) 'The sins of the father would only be exceeded by the ego of the Whose son?
ANGELA: Whose son?
JOHN: Symbol isn't a demon's. that's why I couldn't place it. not a normal possession.
ANGELA: John, what are you talking about?
JOHN: But he can't cross over impossible for the son to cross Whose son? God's?
ANGELA: Whose son? God's?
JOHN: No. The other one. Lucifer had a son too.
BOWLING AREA: Amazing how disturbing a bowling alley is when it's closed. Rows of empty lanes stretching into darkness, the unlit pin areas looking like the jaws of an army of
BEEMAN: This is not good.
BEEMAN: EXT. LA STREETS - NIGHT Angela's SUV races quickly through traffic while John gets her up to speed.
JOHN: But unlike his old man, he's never been in the presence of the Creator so he has no fear of him, no respect either. That goes double for us God's most prized creations. Mammon would be the last demon we'd ever want crossing over.
ANGELA: But demons can't come and go, that's what you said.
JOHN: Unless they found a bridge. Some psychic with the chops to reach all the way to Hell and the grit to withstand whatever shit she'd pull out.
ANGELA: But even a bridge wouldn't help Mammon. Because to cross over, the myth says he'd still need the one thing he could never get. Divine assistance. The help of God.
JOHN: But even a bridge wouldn't help Mammon. Because to cross over, the myth says he'd still need the one thing he could never get. Divine assistance. The help of God.
ANGELA: So it's impossible.
JOHN: Impossible? Sure it's impossible. That's what makes it so dangerous. These things exist to break the rules, to find the loopholes. If the past is any indication, then the future isn't on our side.
ANGELA: She knew. That's why she killed herself. But it doesn't make Makes sense to me.
JOHN: Makes sense to me.
ANGELA: John, she sacrificed herself to beat him.
ANGELA: Why is she in Hell?
JOHN: John grabs the door that leads behind the pin area. It's locked from the other side.
JOHN: ( pounds on door ) Hey, Beeman? Beeman?!
ANGELA: Maybe he's not here.
JOHN: He's always here.
ANGELA: John heads across the lanes. Swarm gets thicker and thicker. Angela keeps up with him, covers her mouth. They approach the pin area of the center lane. The source of the swarm is slowly revealed. In the catch trough is a solid mound of flies. John leans closer, spots a HAND protruding from the He rips his coat off, flings it at the mound and million flies scatter revealing the body of Beeman. Ravaged. Flies pouring out of his mouth, his ears
JOHN: Oh Jesus, no
ANGELA: ( stepping back ) Oh God
JOHN: Who are you?! Answer me!! Goddamit reveal yourself! I summon you!
JOHN: Into the light I command thee!! Into the light I
JOHN: . this is my fault. I sent them in. I sent them right to their deaths. a damn one-man John, you need a doctor.
ANGELA: John, you need a doctor.
JOHN: I've seen a goddamn doctor!!
JOHN: Get away from me!!
ANGELA: Stay the hell away
JOHN: Stay the hell away
ANGELA: But you knew that already, didn't
ANGELA: ( walking towards him ) You see something in me. Something Isabel had.
JOHN: Go home, Angela.
ANGELA: I need to understand
ANGELA: Why not?
JOHN: Because you open up to that world, you're inviting whatever's out there back in. That's what happened to Isabel.
ANGELA: I'm not Isabel.
JOHN: No, she embraced her gift while you denied yours and that denial is exactly why you're still alive. Stick with me, that'll change.
JOHN: And I don't need another ghost following me around.
ANGELA: Dammit, John they killed my
ANGELA: I can't let them get away with that. Even if it means going down the same path she did. Now if you won't help me get there, I'll find my own way. But I won't run.
ANGELA: John can't believe this day looks her dead in the eye.
JOHN: You do this, there's no turning back. You see them they see you. Understand?
ANGELA: Why water?
JOHN: It's the universal conduit. Lubricates the transition from one plane to another. Now ask me if there's water in Hell.
JOHN: Angela grabs his shoulder for balance, lowers herself. When she's sitting, the water is all the way to her neck.
JOHN: Normally only a portion of the body has to be suspended but you wanted the crash course.
ANGELA: ( teeth chattering ) What will I see?
JOHN: Lie down.
ANGELA: ( gesturing the depth ) Lie down?
JOHN: You have to be fully submerged.
ANGELA: For how long?
JOHN: As long as it takes. Here
JOHN: Last chance. Take a deep one.
ANGELA'S POV: A silent John ripples above. His hand grips her arm, skin to skin.
ANGELA: All those people. so sad.
ANGELA: . I've always known. where the bad guys are. where to aim, when to duck. it's not luck. I've always known.
JOHN: Eyes snap open and she's off him in a second, runs out. John pries himself from the tile, goes after her.
ANGELA: It was rolling toward him not a ball something smaller. Shiny.
JOHN: INT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - LATER Beeman's bowling bag is flipped and the contents are dumped onto a table. Powder, bugs and bullets go everywhere. John retrieves the odd-tipped bullets. Those brass knuckles and that copper pipe are taken also.
CHRISTIAN RELICS: are removed from a display cabinet. There's the pure platinum Flask of Divinity, the petrified husk from the River of Life the hollow shaft of an iron cross all striking pieces individually but when twisted and locked together form a very imposing
JOHN: That half-breed tipped my scales when he started killing my friends. I'm just adding a little
ANGELA: What about me? I can't stay here
JOHN: Think of it as a bulletproof vest.
ANGELA: So I'm going.
JOHN: ( knows he can't win ) You're staying in the car.
YOUNG TURK: ( into phone ) Hey, early bird is a fat bird, know what I'm sayin'? What are we pushing today, sir?
PRETTY BOY: What are we pushing today, sir?
BALTHAZAR: Phillip Morris.
BOOOM: One way GLASS EXPLODES outward on the front edge of a FIREBALL sending Balthazar flying with glass and John stands on the other side in an ACCESS CHANNEL that Dragon's breath flamethrower now duct-taped to his holy shotgun.
JOHN: How's he doing it?
BALTHAZAR: This is in direct violation of the Screw the Balance.
JOHN: Screw the Balance.
JOHN: How's he doing it, you half-breed
BALTHAZAR: I will see you very soon.
JOHN: Not really, no.
BALTHAZAR: You can't cheat it this time. you're going back to Hell.
JOHN: True. But you're not.
BALTHAZAR: What are you doing?
JOHN: I'm reading you your last rites.
BALTHAZAR: Your remedial incantations have no relevance to my kind.
JOHN: Aren't you half human?
JOHN: You see, that makes you eligible to be forgiven. You do know what it is to truly be forgiven? To be welcomed into the kingdom of God?
JOHN: A demon in heaven love to be a fly on that wall.
BALTHAZAR: You're not a priest, you have no I escaped hell, who else do you know that has the power to do
JOHN: I escaped hell, who else do you know that has the power to do
JOHN: Just tell me how Mammon is crossing over and you can go back to your shithole.
JOHN: 'May the merciful God have mercy on you and grant you the pardon of all your sins.' 'Whosoever sins you remit on earth they are remitted unto them in heaven. I absolve you from '
JOHN: 'Whosoever sins you remit on earth they are remitted unto them in heaven. I absolve you from '
BALTHAZAR: It may not even work.
JOHN: How? How's he doing it?!
JOHN: ( bellowing out ) 'Grant your child entry into thy kingdom in the name of the Father, and the Son and the Holy Gh '
BALTHAZAR: . Sangre de dio.
JOHN: ( CONTINUED )
BALTHAZAR: What killed the Son of God will give birth to the son of the
JOHN: He's found the Spear.
ANGELA: Something's coming.
JOHN: What happened to staying in the You were in danger.
ANGELA: You were in danger.
JOHN: Well now there's a premonition.
BALTHAZAR: One more chance.
JOHN: He was finished off by a soldier's
ANGELA: I'm Catholic, John I know the crucifixion story.
JOHN: Then you know what this spear would mean to a demon trying to cross over.
JOHN: The stains on its edges?
JOHN: Mammon needed divine assistance how's the blood of God's only son?
ANGELA: So that's it he's got everything he needs to escape.
JOHN: Not quite.
JOHN: Here we go
ANGELA: What is that?
JOHN: A hound on the hunt.
JOHN: Hang on
ANGELA: The beast goes right up the wall and disappears above the BAM, something lands hard on the roof, denting it a good A huge clawed TALON punches into the sheet metal, starts shredding it right over Angela. Talon thrusts in. Angela dodges it her amulet swinging wildly. John HITS the BRAKES and the beast flips off the roof and onto the hood right INTO VIEW. A muscular anomaly with eyes that are unmistakably Balthazar's. He lashes against the windshield with an extra appendage. Thank God for safety glass. He jerks back his embedded talon, pulls the entire windshield out with it, smashing it on the hood. GLASS PARTICLES EXPLODE into the car. John throws the car into a spin, slamming the Barracuda into several parked cars. Balthazar is uprooted, is thrown from the car. Angela looks back, sees Balthazar rolling into traffic.
ANGELA: I lost it.
ANGELA: He's down
JOHN: He's not down. Gimme your phone.
BRITISH MAN: They mark their territory with graffiti instead of urine but they're still very much animals.
CHAZ: This is a private line John?!
JOHN: Chaz where are you?!
CHAZ: Ah. 3rd and Figueroa.
JOHN: You still got that Sedrallus?
CHAZ: ( glancing to couple ) Yeah, but I'm kind of busy right now, John.
JOHN: Dammit, Chaz, I'm trying to save my ass here!
CHAZ: ( under his breath ) What else is new.
JOHN: Remember the Chalic of Enook Oh no, no, no, not that, I just paid off this car!
CHAZ: ( remembering ) Oh no, no, no, not that, I just paid off this car!
JOHN: West side of the 3rd Street Bridge, say.
JOHN: . 2 minutes.
CHAZ: I'm five blocks away! John? John?! Ah. shit.
CHAZ: Sorry, tour's over.
CHAZ: OUT YA WANKERS!!! NOW!!
ANGELA: He's back.
ANGELA: John, he's back and he's gaining!
JOHN: Of course he's gaining.
CHAZ: Shit shit shit
JOHN: 9. 5. 4.
ANGELA: They RIP past the taxi
JOHN: 6. 6. 6
ANGELA: 6. 6. 6
JOHN: Angela punches the last digit as Balthazar LEAPS to jump the taxi
TAXI: EXPLODES right under Balthazar in a tremendous FIREBALL. Initial impact only kicks him higher. It's when the Sedrallus in the tank truly ignites that the real FIREWORKS begin.
JOHN: Where's the amulet?
JOHN: John SLAMS the BRAKES home car spins and John is already jumping out before it comes to a stop. He runs to the rail.
ANGELA!!: John SLAMS the BRAKES home car spins and John is already jumping out before it comes to a stop. He runs to the rail.
CHAZ: ( running up ) What the hell was that?!
JOHN: We're even.
CHAZ: EXT. LAX - DAY Prisoner walks out of the terminal, here at last. He stares at all the vehicles at his disposal. A family crowds around the back of a minivan. Wife hugs the dad.
MYSTERIOUS POV: Watches him from behind. Prisoner turns, looks back, suspiciously. Nothing.
PRISONER: walks out to the street, slides into the minivan, tears away. Kids' toys tumble across the seats.
MIDNITE: Mammon has been trying to climb out of his father's shadow for And this time he might just make Because he's got the Spear?
JOHN: And this time he might just make Because he's got the Spear?
MIDNITE: ( unconvinced ) Because he's got the Spear?
JOHN: And the bridge.
MIDNITE: You're giving this girl way too much credit.
JOHN: You don't know her.
MIDNITE: And you do? That would be a
JOHN: Where's the chair?
MIDNITE: The chair?
JOHN: The delicate little number from Sing Sing?
MIDNITE: It's a fine line that separates a hero from a fool.

MIDNITE: In your condition your body won't take much.
JOHN: I just need enough rope to find And if you do what then?
MIDNITE: And if you do what then?
JOHN: One goddamn problem at a time
JOHN: You want me to sign a waiver?
JOHN: Hang on, Angela.
MIDNITE: I'll try and guide you out.
JOHN: Mammon was forced out of that girl when she jumped so unless he found a holding vessel to wait in, he would have fallen back to Hell.
MIDNITE: Mammon was forced out of that girl when she jumped so unless he found a holding vessel to wait in, he would have fallen back to Hell.
JOHN: No, he's still here. I'm sure of it.
MIDNITE: Then watch yourself. He could be in anyone out there.
JOHN: Roach wings? What happened to using lilac pedals ?

MIDNITE!!: John's hands suddenly become MIDNITE'S as his ally pulls him back into
JOHN: Ravenscar. The abandoned wing. He's in the boy.
MIDNITE: You know these won't kill them.
MIDNITE: You probably won't even get close enough to use them. And it's not just the boy.
MIDNITE: And it's not just the boy.
MIDNITE: You better worry about whoever's helping him.
MIDNITE: As much as I admire your blind faith even in the most dire situations expecting to just waltz into a facility that is about to become the floodgate of Hell is reaching a bit, even for
MIDNITE: Well I suppose two fools can die just as easily as one.
MIDNITE: Hey, you think I'm trusting you to save the world?
MIDNITE: But we're going to need more than a few magic bullets to get inside.
JOHN: That ritual you do with the water, can you do more than one bottle at a time?
MIDNITE: ( sighs )
JOHN: Okay let's cut the scratch and call it a night. Meeting's over.
JOHN: Oh, John, you know how much I love it on this side. This was just an opportunity to make it permanent.
ELLIE: Oh, John, you know how much I love it on this side. This was just an opportunity to make it permanent.

JOHN: ( rushing toward him )
JOHN: Let her up!! Let her up!!
JOHN: John thinks fast scans the area and sees every mirror in the room has been shattered. So much for the quick He jumps into the water with her, grabs her face and pushes her against the tank walls. This is an exorcism on the fly.
