RECEPTIONIST: Can I help you?
ADAM: I have an appointment.
RECEPTIONIST: Adam Schwartz. The Receptionist says nothing. Adam stands silent, not knowing what to do. He coughs again. Annoyed, the Receptionist looks up but says nothing.
ADAM: Adam Schwartz. The Receptionist says nothing. Adam stands silent, not knowing what to do. He coughs again. Annoyed, the Receptionist looks up but says nothing.
RECEPTIONIST: Adam Schwartz. Adam looks around the waiting room. There's no one else there. Again the receptionist calls out again -
ADAM: Yeah, that's me.
RECEPTIONIST: Follow me. The Receptionist leads Adam to a small changing room and hands him a hospital gown.
ADAM: Do I need to take off all my The Receptionist stares blankly at Adam.
NURSE JOANNE: Hi Adam, my name is Joanne, so nice to meet you. Adam scratches his chest, the hospital gown is beginning to irritate his skin.
ADAM: You don't happen to have anything in a cotton blend?
NURSE JOANNE: ( LAUGHS )
ADAM: You want me to fill this entire Adam looks down at the cup in total disbelief.
JOANNE: Adam looks down at the cup in total disbelief.
ADAM: It's gonna take me at least a week to fill this. Can I take it home?
JOANNE: ( LAUGHS )
ADAM: Just another minute. Adam looks down at the empty cup in frustration. The CAMERA PANS to the next room:
JOANNE: Here comes the choo-choo! In the back we see the Med Students still taking notes. The CAMERA PANS to the next room:
TECHNICIAN: ( AUTHORITATIVELY )
ADAM: Hello? Is anybody out there? There's no one there. He's been left unattended. The MRI Technician is watching the Laker game in the next room.
RACHEL: ( asleep and incoherent ) Make it stop.
ADAM: ( WHISPERS )
RACHEL: Rachel gently strokes her fingers through Adam's hair. Something catches her attention - a single strand of hair. She holds it up.
ADAM: I think you have a gray hair.
RACHEL: I think you have a gray hair.
ADAM: I'm gonna pull it out.
RACHEL: I'm gonna pull it out.
ADAM: No! Don't touch it. Adam jumps from bed. He rushes into the bathroom. Rachel rolls back to sleep.
SETH: Hi kids. Beautiful day isn't it? The mother quickly moves her kids out of sight. Adam approaches Seth's car. He spots his neighbors ANDREW and MISSY DONNELLY ( late 40's ) getting into their car. They wave to Adam.
ANDREW: Hey Adam.
ADAM: ( SEEMS ANNOYED )
ANDREW: Sorry about the noise last night. Adam shrugs as if to say "what the fuck?" Andrew and Missy giggle as they get into their car.
SETH: .What's that smell?
ADAM: .What's that smell?
SETH: .What's that smell?
ADAM: Well, you smell like the cast of Steel Magnolias.
SETH: Well, you smell like the cast of Steel Magnolias.
ADAM: ( SMELLS HIMSELF )
SETH: For a second there I thought maybe you'd fucked Olympia Dukakis. Adam tries to close his window. The child safety lock is on.
ADAM: Can you unlock my window? There's a lot of pollen in the air. Seth ignores Adam and turns up the music.
SETH: Sorry music's too loud, it's making it hard for me to hear your INT. COFFEE SHOP - LATER We see the morning bustle as BUSINESS MEN and WOMEN stand in line waiting for their morning coffee. Adam and Seth stand at the end of that line watching the YOUNG COUPLE in front of them who can't keep their hands off of each other.
SETH: I don't get it, that guy is clearly a total douchebag.He's wearing Rachel and I used to be like that; like two wild animals in heat.
ADAM: Rachel and I used to be like that; like two wild animals in heat.
SETH: ( IN SHOCK )
ADAM: ( SHRUGS )
SETH: What the fuck are you talking about? I don't think she's waiting for you to ask anything. You're using her shampoo. Next thing you'll be using her tampons.
ADAM: It's not that big a deal.
SETH: So when does it become a big deal? Five weeks? Six weeks? A year? My cut off.4 days. That's when I begin to worry.
ADAM: Do you realize how lucky I am to be with Rachel?
SETH: Look around, there are like a million Rachel's in this city alone.well, she's kind of hot, so maybe half a million.
ADAM: But they're not Rachel. I don't know how to explain it, but being with her just feels right. And I'm not going to overlook that just cause we're in a lull.
SETH: My parents are in a lull, which is what happens after 35 years of marriage. You've only been dating her four months. At our age sex is all we have. Every time she refuses to sleep with you a small piece of every man's soul dies. She's killing us Adam.You're a semi- smart, semi-successful, semi- average looking dude. Just based on that you could get with at least one third of the female population. Adam and Seth step up to the counter. They're greeted by the SUPER GAY BARISTA, who loves his job way too much.
BARISTA: Morning gentlemen.
SETH: ( TO BARISTA )
BARISTA: Like, right now?
SETH: No just in general.
BARISTA: Yeah, I'd fuck him. The Barista yells to DEMETRI, the other Barista.
DEMETRI: I'd let you blow me.
SETH: ( TO ADAM )
SETH: ( UNDER BREATH )
PHIL: Salutations gentlemen. Phil sniffs the air and looks at Adam.
ADAM: It's Rachel's shampoo. Phil goes in for a closer sniff. Then an even closer sniff. Adam looks uncomfortable.
PHIL: ( DECLARATIVE )
SETH: Ah, mothballs? Seth spots a GROUP OF SECOND GRADERS with their TEACHER assembled by the entrance.
PHIL: How's the Origins exhibit coming We're almost done with Upper I'm counting on you not to screw ( looks into Adam's eyes ) You're the only one I can trust.
ADAM: We're almost done with Upper I'm counting on you not to screw ( looks into Adam's eyes ) You're the only one I can trust.
PHIL: I'm counting on you not to screw ( looks into Adam's eyes ) You're the only one I can trust.
ADAM: I should probably get to work.
PHIL: I should probably get to work.
ADAM: I should probably get to work.
PHIL: That's probably a good idea. Phil looks at the clock - 10 a.m.
ADAM: Greg. What are you doing?
GREG: It's a velociraptor.
ADAM: Where did it come from?
GREG: The dinosaur exhibit. ( off Adam's look ) Why can't we just say it was the first domesticated pet?.People love dinosaurs.
ADAM: Greg you can't just.that's a 75 million year old fossil.just please, put it away before someone sees it. Greg reluctantly goes to put the dinosaur away. He flaps the dinosaur's arm in the air - waving goodbye to Adam. Seth leads his tour of second graders. He speaks like a tour guide at Universal Studios.
SETH: Coming up here on our left is the "Origins of Man" exhibit on loan from the Smithsonian Institute. It won't be open to the public for a few more months, so you're one of the first groups to see it.
ADAM: Hey kids.
SETH: ( TO ADAM )
ADAM: ( BEGRUDGINGLY )
KID 1: ( TO SETH )
GREG: ( TO ADAM )
SETH: ( IN EXCITEMENT )
ADAM: This is Homo Neanderthalensis - the Neanderthal Man. For over 150,000 years his ancestors dominated all of Europe. But then about 30,000 years ago, Neanderthals began to disappear, until one day, their entire civilization was gone.
GREG: What happened?
ADAM: Greg you know what happened.
GREG: I do?
SETH: Come on! Tell us what happened to the caveman.
ADAM: Well no one knows for sure. But it's suspected that because Neanderthal was a nomadic huntsman, he roamed the land, only fending for himself - never learning to cohabitate with others. So as Cro Magnon families settled into Europe, they took over the land. One by one, Neanderthal was pushed out.and never seen, or heard from ( game show voice ) That's quite a story. Thank you Seth and Adam look at the kids, they look bored.
SETH: ( game show voice ) That's quite a story. Thank you Seth and Adam look at the kids, they look bored.
ADAM: ( to the kids ) But you never know, just cause they vanished doesn't mean they're gone. For all we know, there could be a Neanderthal walking among us right now. And by the looks of this guy
KID 1: This sucks ass.
SETH: I see dinosaurs. Seth runs down the hall towards the dinosaur exhibit. The kids follow in excitement. The teacher barely bats an eye as she takes her time slowly trailing after the group.
DR. ROSS: ( into the dictaphone ) Patient has been complaining of excessive urination, back pain, and night sweats. Blood tests and urine analysis are normal. MRI indicates a massive intraduaral extradural
MALIGNANT SCHWANNOMA: neurofibrosarcomas extending into psoas muscle with nerve root compression syndrome and bone We see Adam's face gradually look more and more confused, he slowly begins to raise his arm as if to ask a question.
ADAM: ( DUMBFOUNDED )
DR. ROSS: ( points to MRI ) If you look here on your MRI, you see this cephalopod like object spreading down along your spinal Adam squints. It all looks the same.
ADAM: I still have no idea what you're talking about.
DR. ROSS: It's a malignant tumor.
ADAM: What?!.A tumor? No.
DR. ROSS: I'm afraid so.
ADAM: How is that possible?.I don't smoke. I don't drink. I eat healthy.I even recycle.
DR. ROSS: Well Adam it's actually quite fascinating. Your cancer is the result of an incredibly rare gene mutation in chromosome 17p in the p53 Gene that causes the growth of malignant cells in tissue around the nerves. In your case it's grown along the nerves in your lower Adam looks at himself in the mirror.
ADAM: ( still in denial ) But, look at me. I don't look sick.
DR. ROSS: Cancer often has no specific symptoms. People can go years with out knowing they're sick. We're lucky we caught it before it DR. ROSS ( CONT'D ) I'm going to put you on a 4 month regimen of chemotherapy. It's an aggressive dosage so you might want to think about taking some time off from work. This is real. Adam walks to the window and presses his face against the glass. He looks down at the city below. From 15 stories up, the people on the street look like miniature Adam turns back to Dr. Ross.
ADAM: Can't you just cut it out of me?
DR. ROSS: Yes, that is an option. But because the tumor has spread to a such significant size. Cutting it out now would be risky.
ADAM: Well what are my chances of beating Dr. Ross puts on his best act of reassurance. His words are seemingly genuine, his tone is anything but. DR. Ross Listen, you're in good hands. The best thing for you to do right now is to not worry.Let me do the worrying. Alright? Dr. Ross takes a long look at Adam's devastated face.
LIBRARIAN: Hey bro, time's up. Startled. Adam looks up at the librarian.
ADAM: Can I have just a few more minutes?
LIBRARIAN: Sorry bro. Twenty minute limit.
ADAM: ( still using accent ) This is not going to be easy.
RACHEL: ( still using accent ) This is not going to be easy.
ADAM: We need to talk. Rachel drops the accent. This seems serious.
RACHEL: Why? What's going on?
ADAM: I had a doctor's appointment today.
RACHEL: ( WORRIED )
ADAM: Have you ever seen the movie You mean with Bette Midler?
RACHEL: You mean with Bette Midler?
ADAM: Yeah that one.
RACHEL: Not as good as "The Rose", but Remember the end of "Beaches"?
ADAM: Remember the end of "Beaches"?
RACHEL: ( CONFUSED )
ADAM: I don't know.
RACHEL: You don't know?
ADAM: Well I do know, but I can't pronounce it. Neuroscharnoma or Well how bad is it?
RACHEL: Well how bad is it?
ADAM: It's not good. Rachel hugs Adam. Soaking in the comfort, Adam rests his head on her shoulder. She gently strokes his hair. Adam's hand slowly moves down Rachel's back. He starts kissing her neck. He knows it's wrong, but can't help it, the only thing running through his mind is sex. After a beat Rachel pulls away.
RACHEL: ( begins to cry ) You have cancer.
ADAM: I just think it's an interesting time to take up smoking again.
RACHEL: Adam I'm 24 years old!
ADAM: Sshhhh. Everything's going to be alright Yammy. I'm going to start chemo in a few days.
RACHEL: Do they know? Adam is clearly not in the mood to see his parents.
ADAM: PRE LAP: The sound of a doorbell.
ADAM: Rachel opens the door.
EDITH: ( EXCITED )
ADAM: Where's dad? ART SCHWARTZ( 58 ) enters the house carrying a CAT. Due to a stroke 10 years prior, he carries a limp and is a little out of it.
ART: I found your cat playing in the neighbors yard.
ADAM: Dad, I don't have a cat. Art drops the cat and it bolts out the door.
EDITH: So what's for dinner?
RACHEL: If I had known you were coming I would have made something else.
EDITH: I'm just glad to finally be sharing a shabbat dinner with my son. ( looks at her plate ) So this isn't meat?
RACHEL: No it's called sei-tan.
ADAM: It's made of wheat gluten. Edith looks more confused.
EDITH: But it's not meat.
RACHEL: No, but it has a texture just like Edith reluctantly takes a small bite of the goulash.
EDITH: ( INSINCERE )
RACHEL: ( CONFUSED )
EDITH: ( TO ADAM )
ADAM: ( whispers to Rachel ) What is she talking about?
EDITH: And now Rachel. I know we haven't discussed this, but are you going to convert?
RACHEL: ( whispers to Adam ) She thinks we're getting married.
ADAM: Mom. We're not getting married.
EDITH: Oh thank god.
ADAM: Have you ever seen "Terms of Oh jesus Adam, just tell her.
RACHEL: Oh jesus Adam, just tell her.
EDITH: Tell me what?
ADAM: Alright fine. But, before I tell you, you have to promise me you're going to stay calm.
EDITH: Oh Adam, don't be so overdramatic.
ADAM: Mom, just promise me. Okay?
EDITH: I promise.You make me out to be some kind of irrational loon. Here goes nothing.
ADAM: ( MUMBLES )
EDITH: ( MUMBLES )
ADAM: ( MUMBLES )
EDITH: ( TO RACHEL )
ADAM: ( takes a deep breath ) I have cancer.
EDITH: Cancer? What do you mean you have I - HAVE - CANCER. I don't understand.
ADAM: I - HAVE - CANCER. I don't understand.
EDITH: I don't understand.
ADAM: Mom, I have a giant tumor in my Edith sits motionless for what seems an eternity. The only indication that she's not dead is the movement of her index finger, which twitches uncontrollably. Adam sits uneasy, tying to anticipate his mother's next move.
EDITH: I'm making you green tea.
ADAM: Please, will you come sit down. Edith holds up the package of Green Tea.
EDITH: I saw on the Today Show that it reduces your risk of getting cancer by fifteen percent.
ADAM: Mom, I already have cancer. Refusing to look at her son, Edith frantically rifles through her fanny pack.
EDITH: Here take these. Her hands now shaking uncontrollably, Edith hands Adam a large number of prescription pills.
ADAM: Mom, please, stop. I don't need Just take the god-damn pills. Adam take Edith's hand.
EDITH: ( YELLS )
ADAM: Edith's a nervous wreck, frantic and hysterical.
EDITH: How could this happen?
ADAM: It's genetic.
EDITH: Genetic? It must be from your father's side of the family, they're always getting sick. Your uncle Bobby just got Crohns. Adam's father looks up from his plate of goulash.
ART: That's a disorder of the bowels, son. How are your bowels?
ADAM: The problem is not with my bowels.
ART: You're a lucky man.
ADAM: Thanks dad.
EDITH: I'm moving in.
ADAM: What? No. Absolutely not.
EDITH: Adam, I'm your mother, and I need to be close to you in your time of That's a terrible idea.
ADAM: That's a terrible idea.
EDITH: Well who's going to take care of Mom, I'm fine.
ADAM: Mom, I'm fine.
EDITH: I think I have a right to take care of my son with cancer.
ADAM: It's nothing. Really.
EDITH: Nothing! You tell me you have cancer of the spine and now you tell me it's nothing. Adam looks to Rachel for support.
RACHEL: Edith, I can't even imagine how hard this must be for you. But I promise, there's nothing for you to worry about. I'm going to be here every step of the way, to help take good care of your son.
EDITH: ( TO ADAM )
ADAM: I know.
ADAM: What's taking him so long? How hard is it to buy a cup of coffee? Seth ignores Adam as he stares at the cleavage on the WOMAN behind him.
SETH: ( quietly to Adam ) Look at how tight that shirt is. She's totally aware of how large her breasts look too. This morning when she got dressed, she said to herself - "I have these things and I want the world to see them." Greg looks up at the menu of endless options.
GREG: What about that frozen drink, what's that like?
BARISTA: ( ENTHUSIASTIC )
GREG: I don't know. Does it have a lot of We've been here 20 minutes. What's he shopping for a car? Seth's eyes are still fixed on the woman's breasts.
ADAM: We've been here 20 minutes. What's he shopping for a car? Seth's eyes are still fixed on the woman's breasts.
SETH: Why are you in such a rush? Adam looks around at all the stodgy business men all having menial conversations.
ADAM: Is this really how you want to spend the rest of your life? Wasting away in this place? Greg still hasn't made up his mind. Adam snaps.
SETH: Relax. We have plenty of time.
ADAM: No we don't have plenty of time! Life is finite.
SETH: What the fuck is wrong with you?
ADAM: ( QUIETLY )
SETH: ( LAUGHS )
ADAM: I'm serious.
SETH: Get the fuck out of here. You have People in line look at Seth.
ADAM: Maybe a little louder, you can make a special announcement.

ADAM: What do you mean who?
SETH: Who found the tumor?
ADAM: Lewis and Clark.The doctors found When were you going to tell me?
SETH: When were you going to tell me?
ADAM: I'm telling you now.
SETH: If I had cancer I'd tell you right What do you want the Better Friend award? It's not an easy topic to bring up.
ADAM: What do you want the Better Friend award? It's not an easy topic to bring up.
SETH: Holy shit! Seth takes a deep breath. A look of panic sweeps across his face.he quickly shakes it off.
ADAM: The bright side of what?
SETH: ( EMPHATICALLY ) ( A BEAT )
KATIE: ( mouth full of food ) Can I help you?
ADAM: I have an appointment with Dr. Katie puts down the sandwich, rises from her seat and puts her hand out to shake Adam's.
KATIE: Please call me Katie.
ADAM: ( CONFUSED )
KATIE: You were expecting someone else? Katie wraps up her sandwich and puts the rest away.
ADAM: Aren't you supposed to be like sixty-five and wear earth toned Why? Did someone say that's what I look like?
KATIE: ( SLIGHTLY DEFENSIVE )
ADAM: No, no, no. I was just expecting someone older.
KATIE: Sorry to disappoint you.
ADAM: No believe me, you're fine. Better than fine, you're Dr. McRae.you're a doctor? How old are you?
KATIE: Twenty-six? What are you like Doogie Howser?
ADAM: Twenty-six? What are you like Doogie Howser?
KATIE: Doogie Howser. Off Katie's blank look.
ADAM: Doogie Howser. Off Katie's blank look.
KATIE: Does he work here?
ADAM: No. Nevermind.but aren't you young to be a doctor?
KATIE: I'm actually in my final semester of medical school. ( off Adam's look ) This is a training hospital.
ADAM: So have you had many patients?
KATIE: You're actually my first. That did not help to ease Adam's anxiety.
ADAM: Please sit. Adam notices a dark stain on the couch. He sits as far from it as possible. Katie pulls out Adam's file and sits in a chair across from him. Adam looks anxious, this is his first time in therapy.
KATIE: Please sit. Adam notices a dark stain on the couch. He sits as far from it as possible. Katie pulls out Adam's file and sits in a chair across from him. Adam looks anxious, this is his first time in therapy.
ADAM: Honestly. I feel fine.
KATIE: I think that's great considering what you're going through.
ADAM: Yeah, but I tend to internalize everything so, who knows.
KATIE: You mean you repress as a coping Is that what I do?
ADAM: Is that what I do?
KATIE: That's what you just said.
ADAM: The way I say it sounds cute in a neurotic way. When you say it, it's like an indictment. The word "repress" - sounds so harsh.
KATIE: It's actually quite common.
ADAM: Oh good, I'd hate to think I'm anything but an emotional sheep.
KATIE: Don't think of it in those terms. It's not like it's been a conscious decision on your part. What's important now is for you to be aware of the way you treat your emotions and for me to help you make adjustments.
ADAM: So how do we do that?
KATIE: The first thing I want you to do is to stop looking at cancer as a burden. Cancer has come into your life to show you that your emotional and physical bodies are out of balance. This is your chance to correct that.
ADAM: You're not in a cult are you?
KATIE: Now, why do you say that?
ADAM: I don't know, it was a bad joke.
KATIE: But there's a reason. You chose to use humor rather than express how you really feel. Katie is losing Adam.
ADAM: I want you to lay back and close your eyes. Adam looks down at the coffee stained couch.
KATIE: I want you to lay back and close your eyes. Adam looks down at the coffee stained couch.
ADAM: Lay here?
KATIE: Yes, I want you to just lay back, and let go.
ADAM: Shouldn't we be analyzing my childhood? Or my days as a call Another joke?
KATIE: Another joke?
ADAM: ( SHRUGS ) KATIE ( CONT'D )
KATIE: Katie stands behind Adam and places her hands on his shoulders. Despite the fact that this is all too strange, he doesn't mind, in a weird way, Adam is enjoying the attention. He finally lies down, contorting his body so as to avoid the Adam closes his eyes.
ADAM: I can't believe you got me a Is it that Prada handbag I've been RACHEL ( O.S. ) Even better.
ADAM: What is it?
ADAM: You know how I feel about surprises. Last surprise I got my parents told me I was adopted.
ADAM: Yeah, but sometimes I wish I was. Rachel crosses into the room and stands over Adam.
RACHEL: Okay. Open your eyes. Adam opens his eyes to see Rachel holding a tiny SHIH-TZU wearing a pink ribbon in it's hair.
ADAM: ( DISAPPOINTED )
RACHEL: It's Noodle.
ADAM: It's so small. What do you do with Adam, IT's a he, and HE's adorable.Having a dog is supposed to help with the healing process.
RACHEL: ( ANNOYED )
ADAM: Why, did it go to medical school?
RACHEL: ( PISSED )
ADAM: It looks like a gremlin. What happens if you get it wet after Rachel looks furious. Adam backtracks.
RACHEL: I didn't realize it would be such a big deal.
ADAM: I know what you're doing.
RACHEL: No, you're right, it's not a good idea. Tomorrow I'll take him back where he'll be kept in a tiny cage with 10 other dogs who will bully him, and rape him, and then he'll eventually be euthanized. The dog looks at Adam. It's hopeless, there's no way Adam's going to win this one.
ADAM: Alright. Fine, we can keep the dog.
RACHEL: Rachel's face lights up. She hugs Adam.
ADAM: Rachel's face lights up. She hugs Adam.
RACHEL: This is going to be so good for Adam turns to see the dog shitting on the carpet.
PHIL: ( ANNOUNCES )
ADAM: Here I am. Phil takes a sip from his glass, and then offers it to Adam.

PHIL: So cancer?
ADAM: Yup. The Big C.
PHIL: Phil tugs on Adam's hair.
ADAM: Nope, this is my real hair.
PHIL: ( SENTIMENTAL )
ADAM: ( UNCOMFORTABLE )
JOE: Have you started chemo yet?
ADAM: No, not yet.
JOE: Don't do it man. It'll fuck you up. That's like some Nagasaki shit.

SETH: I know, it's crazy.
JENNY: I've seen him every day for the past two years and I've never once made an effort to talk to him.
SETH: Well I'm his best friend, so talking to me in a way is kind of like talking to him.
JENNY: Oh what does it matter? It's too Jenny walks away crying. Seth follows after her.
SETH: Wait. It's not too late.
GREG: Hey Adam.
ADAM: ( less than excited ) Hey Greg.
GREG: My uncle had what you have.
ADAM: Man that was the worst.
GREG: Man that was the worst.
ADAM: Your uncle had Schwannoma Yeah, I think so. It's the thing with the toe and the screaming, and everything tastes like olives? Adam looks perplexed.
GREG: Yeah, I think so. It's the thing with the toe and the screaming, and everything tastes like olives? Adam looks perplexed.
ADAM: Well that was a nightmare.
RACHEL: Adam, those people just threw you a party.They love you.
ADAM: Half those people don't even know The car stops at a red light. Rachel looks at Adam. She finds his pouting adorable. He sees her staring,
RACHEL: ( SMILES )
ADAM: ( SMILES )
RACHEL: I love you.
ADAM: I love you. Rachel takes Adam's hand.
RACHEL: Everything's going to be okay. They look intensely into each others eyes and then kiss.
ADAM: You are so unbelievably sexy.
RACHEL: I'm totally yours, Suddenly there's a loud scratching at the bedroom door, followed by a loud whimpering. Rachel stops.
ADAM: The dog. Adam continues to kiss Rachel.
RACHEL: The dog. Adam continues to kiss Rachel.
ADAM: Ignore him.
RACHEL: I think he needs to go out.
ADAM: I'll do it after. The two continue making out. The dog starts to bark.
RACHEL: I can't do this with him barking.
ADAM: ( to the dog ) Come on. Today.If I don't get laid tonight because of you, I'm going to take your little bow and make a noose. The dog sniffs around, trying to find the perfect spot.
NEIGHBOR: Nice dog. Once the neighbor is out of sight-
ADAM: Will you please just finish. The dog finally finishes. Adam runs back into the house. After a minute, he realizes he left the dog in the street. He runs back after the dog, scoops him up and then runs back INT. ADAM'S HOUSE. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS Adam fumbles around in the dark as he tears off his clothes. He then climbs back into bed, spoons Rachel, and begins seductively kissing her neck. He slowly moves his hand downwards. Rachel takes Adam's hand, pulls it up, and clasps it tight against her chest.
RACHEL: Hold me.
ADAM: ( UNDER BREATH )
RACHEL: Do you want me to?
ADAM: I was thinking it might be nice, now that I'm not going to work anymore. And with my chemo Rachel turns to Adam.
RACHEL: ( SMILES )
ADAM: ( WHISPERS )
RACHEL: ( ASLEEP )
EDITH: Art come on.
ART: I'm coming. Art, still in the car, doesn't move. Edith looks at her watch and walks back to the car.
EDITH: We're late. Edith grabs Art's hand. He slowly gets out of the car.
USHER: Please take your seats. The Usher motions for Edith and company to sit in the back.
EDITH: What about those seats up there in the front?
USHER: The service has begun.
EDITH: Please. My son has cancer. Adam's jaw tightens, he can't believe his mother just did that. The Usher looks at Adam, sizing up the situation. Adam couldn't be more uncomfortable.
USHER: Please, follow me. The usher leads the group to the front and directs the people in the front row to let them pass through. Edith apologizes as each person they pass has to stand to let them by.

EDITH: ( OVERDRAMATIC )
ROSE: I heard about the
EDITH: I can't tell you how hard it's been on me. My only child. God only knows what terrible thing I did to deserve this. I've got a catatonic husband and a son with cancer. Not to mention my arthritis. I don't know how I'll ever get through it. As Adam walks through the atrium, he notices everyone whispering and pointing at him. Rabbi Jacobs ( 75 ) exits the bathroom, pulls up his fly and spots Adam. Jacobs has the face of a leather couch from all the tanning and face lifts. He spots Adam.
RABBI: Ladies and gentleman, Adam Rabbi Jacobs.
ADAM: Rabbi Jacobs.
RABBI: How are you son?
ADAM: Oh you know, just trying to live by the Covenant.
RABBI: Don't bullshit me. You were the worst student I ever had. I bet you haven't even spoken a word of Hebrew since your Bar Mitzvah.
ADAM: I don't like to brag, but I couldn't speak it then.
RABBI: Your mother told me about your Adam looks over to see his mother surrounded by a dozen sympathetic listeners as she tells them her horror story of having a son with cancer.
ADAM: I'm sure she did.
RABBI: It's not easy for a mother to see her son go through something like Nothing is easy for my mother.
ADAM: Nothing is easy for my mother.
RABBI: Have you thought about trying to reconnect with the Torah?
ADAM: Honestly, I'm just here to make my mother happy. It was either this or I had to go see my cousin perform in his high school theatre's adaptation of "You've Got Mail".
RABBI: Well think about it. I'm always INT. HOSPITAL - DAY ALAN ALDA looks directly into the camera. The year is 1970.
ALAN ALDA: Hi there, I'm Alan Alda. Alan Alda walks down the hospital corridor.
GEORGE: Adam Schwartz. Adam stands.
MITCH: That's Henry.
ADAM: Is he okay?
MITCH: He's always like that.
ADAM: ( TERRIFIED )
MITCH: Best not worry about these things. ALAN ( 84 ), the contentious old man sitting next to Mitch chimes in.
ALAN: ( TO ADAM )
MITCH: It makes it all a little easier to What if someone sees us?
ADAM: ( PARANOID )
ALAN: Don't be such an old man. Look at this place, it's like Death Row in here, they don't give a shit what we do. Adam reluctantly takes a hit.
MITCH: How old are you?
ADAM: You're lucky. Life only gets worse Alan, stop it.
ALAN: You're lucky. Life only gets worse Alan, stop it.
MITCH: Alan, stop it.
ALAN: No I'm not.
MITCH: You'll have to excuse Alan here, he's going through a rough time.
ALAN: ( TO ADAM )
ADAM: Not really.
ALAN: Don't end up a victim like the rest of `em. Life sucks, the earlier you accept it, the better off you'll I got to tell you, I was really nervous about this whole cancer thing, and then I met you guys, and boy do I feel better. Alan and Mitch laugh.
ADAM: I got to tell you, I was really nervous about this whole cancer thing, and then I met you guys, and boy do I feel better. Alan and Mitch laugh.
ALAN: ( TO MITCH )
MITCH: Mitch Horowitz, metastatic prostate Adam Schwartz, schwannoma What the fuck is that?.Sounds like the greek dish I had for Adam is beginning to feel the effects of the weed.
ADAM: Adam Schwartz, schwannoma What the fuck is that?.Sounds like the greek dish I had for Adam is beginning to feel the effects of the weed.
ALAN: What the fuck is that?.Sounds like the greek dish I had for Adam is beginning to feel the effects of the weed.
ADAM: . man this pot is really strong.
MITCH: Good shit eh. Adam stares off into space. He's really high, almost like he's tripping. The walls start spinning.
ALAN: Good shit eh. Adam stares off into space. He's really high, almost like he's tripping. The walls start spinning.
CARNIE: Hey you! What do you think you're Everything Adam says is in German and subtitled in English.
ADAM: I want to ride.
CARNIE: Read the sign. The Carnies points to a sign that reads "No Cancer."
ADAM: I don't have cancer.
CARNIE: Then what's that? The Carnie points out Adam's T-shirt, it reads "I'M WITH
CANCER.": Adam turns around to see a GIANT BALD FAT MAN eating cotton candy, his shirt reads "CANCER". Adam tries to run away, but he's attached to the Giant Fat Bald Guy via an umbilical cord. The Giant Fat Bald Guy reaches out, picks Adam up, and swallows him.
KATIE: So how do you feel after your first I feel like I was just gang raped by the Buena Vista Social Club.
ADAM: I feel like I was just gang raped by the Buena Vista Social Club.
KATIE: Is everything with you going to be a joke?
ADAM: I'm serious. Have you heard their horn section?
KATIE: Adam, you have a responsibility to your mind and body.
ADAM: I was just injected with three pints of kryptonite. Can we please hold off on the new agey stuff.
KATIE: You can't just sit there and ignore what's happening to you.You need to stop bottling everything up.
ADAM: What I need is for people to stop telling me what I need.
KATIE: Have you considered that this cancer is nature's way of telling you to change the way you live your ( off Adam's look ) .There's an old saying - you can't change the wind, but you can adjust the sails.
ADAM: They teach you that in medical Katie's patience is waning.
KATIE: I know you don't like to talk about your feelings, but you have to learn to find an outlet.
ADAM: ( FRUSTRATED )
KATIE: And how is your body ever going to fight the stress of that cancer if you can't even handle your own Adam snaps, rasing his voice.
ADAM: Well excuse me. You'll have to forgive me for not having a firm handle on my emotions at this particular juncture of my life. Katie's a little shaken by Adam's outburst. She stays firm.
KATIE: You don't have to be here. Adam knows he went too far. Plus, that little outburst lifted a little wight off his shoulders, and he knows it.
ADAM: I'm sorry, I know you're only trying to help.
KATIE: I want you to do some homework. Here's a list of books on mind-body therapy. They should help you get Katie hands Adam a sheet of paper with a list of books scribbled on it.
SETH: ( IN EXCITEMENT )
ADAM: Why would we go to Mardi Gras?
SETH: Because it's Mardi Gras man. It's like a giant orgy of the sexiest women you can imagine all throwing themselves at you, screaming to be fucked. It's a fuck fest.
ADAM: I'm getting chlamydia just listening to you talk about it.
SETH: We need to go see the world.
ADAM: This isn't my bachelor party we're planning here.
SETH: ( FRUSTRATED )
ADAM: I'm not going anywhere. From across the store, Seth notices, CLAIRE ( 30 ), an attractive employee stacking books.
SETH: Well if you're not going to take advantage of your cancer, then I Seth yanks the list of books from Adam and crosses to Claire.
CLAIRE: Yes, how can I help you?
SETH: I'm looking to buy a few books - Seth hands Claire the list of book titles. She reads.
CLAIRE: ( CONCERNED )
SETH: No that's okay. They're for my best friend, Adam. Seth nods towards Adam across the room.
CLAIRE: How awful.
SETH: Yeah. Cancer, not cool.
CLAIRE: Poor guy.
SETH: I know it's been really hard. Claire leans in.
CLAIRE: It's bad isn't it?
SETH: ( FEIGNING SADNESS )
ADAM: What just happened?
SETH: ( TO ADAM )
ADAM: Are you going to the park again? Rachel enters the room with the dog cradled in her arms.
RACHEL: He likes running around with the other dogs.
ADAM: He can barely make it to the door without shitting himself. Rachel finds the leash and then smells the joint.
RACHEL: ( TAKEN ABACK )
ADAM: Since when do you smoke?
RACHEL: Since when do you smoke?
ADAM: It's medicinal. Rachel's shocked, this is way out of character for Adam.
RACHEL: You got a prescription for medicinal marijuana?
SETH: No, I did.
RACHEL: What's wrong with you?
SETH: Night blindness. Rods and cones are Rachel rolls her eyes. Seth is ridiculous. Then she notices the new flat screen TV on the wall and just like that, her demeanor switches. She looks pissed.
RACHEL: Where did that TV come from?
ADAM: The store. ( off Rachel's furious
LOOK ): It's medicinal?
RACHEL: I thought we already agreed that my painting was going there.
ADAM: ( trying to reason ) Why can't we put up both?
RACHEL: You want me to put my painting next to a television?
ADAM: ( SHRUGS ) ( YELLS )
RACHEL: ( YELLS )
ADAM: ( calls out to Rachel ) Love you. The door slams.
SETH: Great. Maybe she'll move there.
ADAM: Can you not talk about her like Seth nearly chokes as he inhales.
SETH: Are you joking? Do you see the way she treats you?
ADAM: She's got some kind of creative block.It's her process.
SETH: You have cancer for fuck's sake! If I was your girlfriend, I'd be baking you cookies and blowing you every thirty minutes. Instead, she's yelling at you over some fucking painting. Her art sucks. You don't want to put that on your wall. It looks like someone threw up a shrimp cocktail and then used it to spackle the Berlin Wall.
ADAM: We're going through a rough patch. That's what happens in Bullshit. She's fucking you in the ass Adam. This is the one time in your life you can do whatever you want. If you want to smoke weed, then smoke. You want a 50 inch flat screen TV, then get the fucking TV! And if you want to go to Mardi Gras, then LET'S GO TO MARDI GRAS!
SETH: ( SERIOUS )
ADAM: We're not going to Mardi Gras. Seth takes a hit from the joint and hands it back to Adam.
SETH: ( as he exhales ) You're totally missing my point.
ADAM: I've been reading your books, and you know it actually makes sense.Some of it.
KATIE: ( EXCITED )
ADAM: Sure, if you think it'll help.
LAUGHTER THERAPIST: Good morning class. Before we begin I'd like to introduce Adam and Seth, our two newest giggle gurus. The class laughs. Adam and Seth look around paranoid.
SETH: ( quietly to Adam ) What are they laughing at?
ADAM: ( quietly to Seth ) Just go with it. Seth and Adam laugh along with the others.
LAUGHTER THERAPIST: ( to Adam and Seth ) Now what you'll soon discover is the true miracle and gift of LAUGHTER THERAPIST ( CONT'D ) Learning to laugh at ourselves and others through non- judgemental means is far more effective than any prescription drug, or, rehabilitation center. You see, when we laugh, our bodies release endorphins that not only support the immune system, but also release deeply stored emotional pain, and give us a fresh new outlook on life. The Laugh Therapist opens his eyes and stares intensely at Adam and then Seth.
ADAM: I, ah, have cancer. The entire class laughs hysterically.
LAUGHTER THERAPIST: Ah cancer yes. Yes. Laugh. Everyone. Beverly, share -
BEVERLY: Yesterday, I confiscated my son's pornography collection and then used it to masturbate 6 times. The class laughs.
LAUGHTER THERAPIST: Paul, share,
PAUL: My wife told me she's a lesbian. And then left me for my sister.
LAUGHTER THERAPIST: JIM - ( GLUM )
JIM: ( GLUM )
LAUGHTER THERAPIST: SETH -
SETH: My best friend is a giant pussy. The class laughs.
ADAM: My best friend's favorite band is Everyone laughs except for Seth.
SETH: ( DEFENSIVE )
LAUGHTER THERAPIST: ( HYSTERICAL )
ALAN: ( CONFIDENT )
MITCH: CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal an INSANELY HOT WOMAN with giant breasts in a hospital gown walk by the three men.
ADAM: CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal an INSANELY HOT WOMAN with giant breasts in a hospital gown walk by the three men.
ALAN: You're both wrong. I think I know real when I see it. The hot woman scratches her head, revealing that she's wearing a WIG.
MITCH: How come we've never met Rachel?
ALAN: Yeah. What the fuck?
ADAM: She's been really stressed lately, Adam looks around at all the sick people.
ALAN: Smart man. Save yourself the Don't listen to him Adam. It's important to be with your loved ones in times like these.
MITCH: Don't listen to him Adam. It's important to be with your loved ones in times like these.
ALAN: Bullshit. Women are nothing but They're selfish animals who only add to the misery in your life. You want to talk about a cancer.
MITCH: Listen to me Adam, I've been married 40 years and it's my Margaret who keeps me going. Mitch pulls out his wallet. He holds out a picture of his wife MARGARET ( 80 ).
ALAN: That's precious Mitch, I almost want to wrap it up and tie a little bow around it.
ADAM: ( INTO PHONE )
ADAM: ( INTO PHONE )
KATIE: ( EMBARRASSED )
ADAM: ( EMBARRASSED )
KATIE: What are you doing?
ADAM: Just waiting for Rachel to pick me What time is she coming?
KATIE: What time is she coming?
ADAM: Uh, four. Katie looks at her watch.
KATIE: It's six thirty.
ADAM: She must be stuck in traffic.
KATIE: You want a ride?
KATIE: Sorry about the mess. Adam picks up a copy of "Organizing Your Way to Success," which is lying on the floor.
ADAM: I think you should ask for a I know, I know. What can I say? I'm not good at getting rid of things. I get easily attached.
KATIE: I know, I know. What can I say? I'm not good at getting rid of things. I get easily attached.
ADAM: Yeah, I can see. Changing the subject.
KATIE: So you don't drive?
ADAM: But you have a license?
KATIE: But you have a license?
ADAM: ( BEAT )
KATIE: ( EMBARRASSED )
ADAM: ( EMBARRASSED )
KATIE: But, I thought you can re-take the Eh. Let's just say, that the state of California felt it was best I Katie stares at Adam in shock.
ADAM: Eh. Let's just say, that the state of California felt it was best I Katie stares at Adam in shock.
KATIE: What did you do?
ADAM: I kind of backed my mom's car down an embankment.Into the Balboa cactus garden.
KATIE: The garden with all the endangered They didn't want to tow it out in fear of destroying more of the vegetation, so they had to use a giant crane. Katie lets out a tiny chuckle, but quickly contains herself.
ADAM: They didn't want to tow it out in fear of destroying more of the vegetation, so they had to use a giant crane. Katie lets out a tiny chuckle, but quickly contains herself.
KATIE: I'm sorry. That's terrible. Unable to hold back, Katie continues laughing. This is the first time we've seen Katie let go of her rigid nature.
ADAM: ( ABRUPT )
KATIE: Why what's wrong?
ADAM: Just stop the car. Katie stops the car. Adam grabs a handful of Katie's garbage and gets out.
KATIE: What are you doing?
ADAM: I can't handle all this mess. Adam tosses the garbage in a dumpster and comes back to the car for more. Katie starts laughing, she can't believe Adam is cleaning her car.
KATIE: Wait, no, not that, that's my Adam leaves Katie's dinner and throws out the rest of the garbage. He gets back in the car and takes a deep breath.
ADAM: You can drive.
ADAM: Thanks for the ride. Adam looks at his house. The lights are out. He's really not in the mood to be alone. He looks back at Katie.
KATIE: It probably wouldn't be very professional of me.
ADAM: Come on, I'll let you analyze my Katie is hesitant, but she also feels in a strange way that Adam is more than a patient.
KATIE: Uh, okay. But I can't stay long.
KATIE: You know you are terrible at this? Adam is totally lost. He has zero sense of how to play.
ADAM: I've never played before.
KATIE: This is your Playstation.
ADAM: Doesn't mean I play it. Games these days today are so complicated.
KATIE: ( LAUGHS )
ADAM: She has a sense of humor. Katie's face lights up. She's proud of herself for that one.
KATIE: That must have been hard, seeing him lose his cognitive skills like This is the most emotionally honest we've ever seen Adam.
ADAM: Well the funny thing is that the stroke actually made him a better player, he just lost interest. Katie feels for Adam.
KATIE: You've never talked about your dad.
ADAM: Well whose fault is that? Doctor?
KATIE: The two continue to play. Adam wildly pushes every button as Katie's character pins Adam's character and repeatedly slams his head into the ground.
ADAM: You ever had this stuff.
KATIE: No, but it's supposed to be really good for you.
ADAM: Well it smells like my grandmother.
KATIE: You complain a lot.
ADAM: You haven't met my mother. It's a miracle I do anything but I try not to look at the world like The world would be a boring place if we didn't complain. Come on. There's got to be something. One thing, just one thing, that drives you nuts.
KATIE: I try not to look at the world like The world would be a boring place if we didn't complain. Come on. There's got to be something. One thing, just one thing, that drives you nuts.
ADAM: The world would be a boring place if we didn't complain. Come on. There's got to be something. One thing, just one thing, that drives you nuts.
KATIE: ( FISHING )
ADAM: It's infuriating right?
KATIE: I wouldn't say infuriating. It's just not good work place etiquette. Adam is far more excited by this revelation. He hands Katie a shot of wheat grass and takes one last sniff of the awful smelling drink. He raises his glass to make a toast.
ADAM: To complaining. Adam downs the drink and cringes at the taste. Katie follows, and in total disgust, she spits her wheat grass all over Adam's face.
KATIE: Oh god, that's disgusting. I'm so Katie grabs a towel as Adam stands speechless.
ADAM: Is it all gone? For the first time, Katie notices how cute Adam is. Adam opens his eyes to catch Katie staring at him. They lock eyes for a moment. Uncomfortable, Adam averts his look. Suddenly, Rachel walks through the front door.
KATIE: I should probably be going. Rachel enters the kitchen.
RACHEL: Finally. Where have you been?
ADAM: Finally. Where have you been?
RACHEL: ( MAD )
ADAM: Oh, this is Dr. McRae, my This is your therapist?
RACHEL: ( SUSPICIOUS )
KATIE: Please, call me Katie.
RACHEL: ( SUSPICIOUS )
ADAM: She drove me home. Ring a bell?
RACHEL: Ugh. Shit.
KATIE: Awkward silence. The tension is thick.
ADAM: Where have you been?
RACHEL: I was at the gallery.
ADAM: ( PISSED )
RACHEL: I know. I'm sorry. I totally spaced. With the opening only three months away my head's just all over the place. ( off Adam's look )
ADAM: You're right. Let me go back and talk to the doctor - see if maybe they can diagnose me with something that better suits your needs.
RACHEL: ( DEFENSIVE )
ADAM: And my house isn't a summer camp. You can't just come and go as you please and not take some And what is it that I'm not taking responsibility for?
RACHEL: And what is it that I'm not taking responsibility for?
ADAM: This. Us.
RACHEL: I can't handle this! You make it sound like I'm your wife.
ADAM: You know what I thought the other day? That I might actually die without ever having sex again.
RACHEL: I'm sorry if your cancer isn't turning me on. Rachel begins to cry.
ADAM: ( RELENTS )
RACHEL: Why are you so good?
ADAM: You're my Yam.
RACHEL: What's wrong?
ADAM: I can't.
RACHEL: Adam looks down.
ADAM: I don't know what's wrong.
ADAM: Where's Alan? Speechless, Mitch looks up at Adam and slowly shakes his head. Tears roll down Mitch's cheek. Adam's face goes white.
ADAM: Excuse me. The old man stops his cart.
OLD MAN: How can I help you?
ADAM: Where am I?
OLD MAN: The After Life.
ADAM: This is Heaven? The old man scratches his balls.
OLD MAN: Pretty great huh? They've even got a frozen yogurt machine. The old man points to a long line of excited seniors awaiting their turn at a massive Frozen Yogurt Sundae Bar. A sign in front reads "WAIT: 45 MINUTES".
ADAM: There are lines in Heaven?
OLD MAN: It's worth it. End Dream.
RABBI: So you want to know what's going to happen when you die?
ADAM: I think it's a fair question.
RABBI: Fair yes, but impossible for me to answer. Our deaths, like our lives, have meaning and are all part of God's plan. How should I know what God has planned for you. Maybe if you came to service once in a Well am I going to go to Heaven?
ADAM: Well am I going to go to Heaven?
RABBI: What if I want to just die? That's it. No Heaven.
ADAM: What if I want to just die? That's it. No Heaven.
RABBI: That's like buying a ticket for a cruise and then not going. The Afterlife is where the fun begins.
ADAM: How can being stuck in some nonexistent void with my grandparents be fun. I spent my entire life trying to get away from my family, now I'm going to have to spend an eternity with them.
RABBI: Adam, you can not look at death as a curse. Even in death we are all still part of God. Life on Earth is just the beginning.
ADAM: But that's not what I want.
RABBI: ( FRUSTRATED )
KATIE: You're being awfully quiet today. Is everything okay?
ADAM: I'm going to die aren't I?
KATIE: What are you talking about?
ADAM: It's true.
KATIE: We don't know that. Adam sits up and looks at Katie.
ADAM: I'm not getting any better.
KATIE: Don't say that, you're doing so Did you know that they found a Quasar 7 billion light years away? 7 billion light years! It's more than 3 billion years older than our planet, and we're just seeing it now; and you think I'm going to What are you talking about?
ADAM: Did you know that they found a Quasar 7 billion light years away? 7 billion light years! It's more than 3 billion years older than our planet, and we're just seeing it now; and you think I'm going to What are you talking about?
KATIE: ( TOTALLY BAFFLED )
ADAM: Cancer is an epidemic! It killed Alan, it's going to kill me, and it's going to kill millions more after me. There's nothing anybody can do.
KATIE: This is really good Adam. Let it Will you stop!
ADAM: Will you stop!
KATIE: This helplessness you're feeling is normal. These emotions you're holding onto are what make you human. But it doesn't mean you can just stop living your life.
ADAM: I know you're only trying to help, but this isn't working for me I'm sorry. Adam leaves. Katie is left feeling as though she failed.
ADAM: I need a new lint brush.
RACHEL: Okay, I'll pick one up.
ADAM: And I have a doctor's appointment next Thursday.The big one. Rachel continues to examines her waist.
RACHEL: Am I getting fat? Adam stares at Rachel.
ADAM: Are you listening to me?
RACHEL: ( ANNOYED )
ADAM: So you'll take me?
RACHEL: Of course. Rachel leaves. In frustration Adam weakly picks up the scale and throws it against the wall, smashing it.
PHIL: You look great.
ADAM: ( INSINCERE )
PHIL: ( INSINCERE )
ADAM: I want to come back to work.
PHIL: ( IN DISBELIEF )
ADAM: What's so crazy about that?
PHIL: You could be anywhere right now, and this is that place?
ADAM: Are you sure that's a good idea? Phil is treading a fine line.
PHIL: Are you sure that's a good idea? Phil is treading a fine line.
ADAM: You said I look great.
PHIL: Yeah for a guy with cancer. Adam looks dejected. Phil feels bad, he went too far.
ADAM: Thank you Phil.
PHIL: ( SYMPATHETICALLY )
ADAM: Oh it's really good. We've come to an understanding. It takes whatever it wants and depletes me of my every will to live, and I let it. Phil, second-guessing his decision-
PHIL: Welcome back.
SETH: And if you look over on your left you'll see our newest exhibit "The Last Days Pompeii." Buried in 79 AD by the catastrophic eruption of Mt. Vesuvius, Pompeii remained hidden and forgotten until 1748 when archeologists began to excavate the site. Here we see exquisitely preserved objects that offer a glimpse into the day-to-day life of this ancient city. Seth comes upon Adam who is working closely on a diorama.
ADAM: ( UPBEAT )
SETH: Ok. Moving along we see the beautiful watercolor paintings of John James Audobon.
ADAM: ( AWKWARD )
PHIL: You feeling okay? You don't look so Could be worse. Right? Phil notices the Pompeii exhibit.
ADAM: Could be worse. Right? Phil notices the Pompeii exhibit.
PHIL: ( STARTLED )
ADAM: Don't worry.I get it. You're a good guy.
PHIL: Come back when you're better. You know you'll always have a home INT. MUSEUM. ORIGINS OF MAN EXHIBIT - MOMENTS LATER Distraught, Adam walks down the Hall of Evolution. Slouched in defeat, he passes the various dioramas depicting human evolution. He begins at MODERN HUMANS and walks backwards in He comes to the family of Cro Magnons, then Neanderthal man. He stops and looks at Neanderthal - their slumped profiles match. He continues down the hall towards the exit.
ADAM: ( SWEET )
ADAM: Hey man, I need you to do me -
ADAM: Hi mom.
CUTE NURSE: The Doctor wanted me to apologize for running late, he's just in with another patient, but should be out in a few minutes. You guys holding up alright?
EDITH: It's very cold in here. Is there anyway you can turn down the Air Unfortunately the temperature is controlled by a central thermostat.
CUTE NURSE: Unfortunately the temperature is controlled by a central thermostat.
EDITH: My son has cancer.
CUTE NURSE: ( FEELS BAD )
ADAM: ( smiles to the Nurse ) Don't worry about it. ( Scowls at Edith ) I'm fine.
CUTE NURSE: Are you sure? I could get you a No, really, I'm okay. But thank I'd love a blanket.

EDITH: I'd love a blanket.
ADAM: ( to the Cute Nurse ) We're fine.
CUTE NURSE: Okay, but you let me know if you need anything. The Nurse smiles at Adam in sympathy, he smiles back. The Cute Nurse exits.
EDITH: ( Re: the cute nurse ) I don't like her. Edith puts her hand on Adam's forehead. He looks at her hand and then picks up a magazine in an attempt to ignore her.
ADAM: I'm fine. Edith pulls some pills out her fanny pack.
EDITH: Take these.
ADAM: ( ANNOYED )
EDITH: Do you know what it's like to fear losing your son? No. You don't. When you have children of your own we can discuss it. Now take the Adam puts the pills in his mouth and pretends to swallow. Edith gets up from her chair. As soon as his mother turns away, Adam spits the pills into his hand. Edith paces around the room looking at the Doctor's various degrees on the wall.
ADAM: Oh nothing.
EDITH: Oh nothing.
ADAM: ( ANNOYED )
EDITH: It's nothing, he went to a state You're unbelievable.
ADAM: You're unbelievable.
EDITH: I just worry that you're not getting the best care possible. Adam can't take it anymore.
ADAM: Well who needs a doctor when they've got you and your fanny You can be a little shit sometimes, you know that? You think I don't know what's best for you? I birthed you. You came out of me. I am your mother, for better or for worse, so accept it. ( Re: fanny pack ) You don't like this, well I'm sorry. It's my own way of caring.
EDITH: You can be a little shit sometimes, you know that? You think I don't know what's best for you? I birthed you. You came out of me. I am your mother, for better or for worse, so accept it. ( Re: fanny pack ) You don't like this, well I'm sorry. It's my own way of caring.
ADAM: ( SNAPS )
EDITH: Yes you did. I drive you crazy. Adam gently puts his hand on Edith's shoulder.
ADAM: Edith turns to Adam helpless and scared.
EDITH: You're all I've got. Look at your We see Art sitting in the chair picking his nose.
ADAM: He was the greatest thing to ever happen to me. And then I had you, and that was even greater. So if I hover and threaten your independence, so what? You have a mother who loves you more than anything. Is that so awful?
EDITH: He was the greatest thing to ever happen to me. And then I had you, and that was even greater. So if I hover and threaten your independence, so what? You have a mother who loves you more than anything. Is that so awful?
ADAM: No. It's not. Adam and Edith share a moment.Dr. Ross storms in the room carrying a stack of MRI films. He seems rushed.
DR. ROSS: Sorry to keep you folks waiting. It's been one of those days.car got towed. Wife double parked it. Adam and Edith look at Dr Ross with blank stares.
ADAM: So what do we do?
DR. ROSS: We need to operate. If we don't remove it soon we risk metastasis.
ADAM: But you said surgery was too risky.
DR. ROSS: We're out of options. Tears roll down Edith's cheek. Adam grabs hold of her hand.
EDITH: But he's going to be okay, right? You're going to fix it. Dr. Ross sits, he knows this can't be easy for a mother.
DR. ROSS: This surgery is no guarantee. The risks are tremendous. And, even if we're able to remove the tumor there's still the chance that Adam, you'll never be able to walk again. Adam looks at his mother. He firmly grabs hold of her hand.
ADAM: Does that mean.I can get handicap Adam's line breaks the tension forcing a slight smile across Edith's face.
RACHEL: Hey you. Rachel gleefully skips over and gives Adam a sweet kiss on the cheek.
ADAM: Smells good.
RACHEL: The girls and I are having a movie night. I somehow got suckered into ( off Adam's look ) Don't worry I left you some. Adam feigns a smile, hiding the pain of his heart breaking in a thousand pieces. Suddenly Rachel's iPhone VIBRATES. She picks it up, and reads her text message. Her face lights up as she reads. She quickly types a reply.
ADAM: ( SUSPICIOUS )
RACHEL: Susan. She wants to know what time I'm coming over.
ADAM: ( even more suspicious ) That's what she just texted?
RACHEL: Uh huh.
ADAM: Alright, well I'm gonna go lie I might be out late so don't wait Adam walks to the bedroom. After a beat he moves back to the doorway and pops his head around the corner. He quietly watches Rachel cross from the kitchen into the living room. He stealthily steps into the kitchen, picks Rachel's iPhone off the counter and scrolls through her text messages.

ADAM: ( TO SELF )
RACHEL: What are you doing?
ADAM: Who's James?
RACHEL: My art partner.
ADAM: ( re: text message ) He wants to know if you're still coming over tonight. Should I tell him you're having a girls night?
RACHEL: I can't believe you just invaded my privacy like that.
ADAM: ( READING PHONE )
RACHEL: ( FUMING )
ADAM: ( READING ) ( A BEAT )
RACHEL: Adam, it's not what you think.
ADAM: Well now how do you know what I'm Don't be like that. I didn't do anything wrong.
RACHEL: Don't be like that. I didn't do anything wrong.
ADAM: ( SERIOUS )
RACHEL: Adam you're being ridiculous.
ADAM: Am I? Adam holds up Rachel's phone to display a photo of Rachel naked, covered in red paint.
SETH: Hey guys. Adam and Rachel say nothing. Seth can tell he just walked into some major shit.
RACHEL: It's a portrait series, commenting on post-colonial patriarchy in the ( off Adam's look ) .That's it. Nothing more.
ADAM: Have you lost your mind? I had the most important appointment of my life today and you missed it because you were off with your "art partner".And what the fuck do you know about Africa? Rachel totally forgot about his appointment. The guilt runs through her body.
RACHEL: Oh shit. I forgot. Please, Adam, I'm so sorry.
ADAM: Did you cheat on me?
RACHEL: ( CRYING )
ADAM: Like a child being scolded, Rachel's face says it all.
RACHEL: ( POUTING )
ADAM: ( BEAT ) ( CRYING HYSTERICALLY )
RACHEL: ( CRYING HYSTERICALLY )
ADAM: You know, you have a pretty fucked up way of showing your commitment.
RACHEL: I told you I couldn't handle this! Rachel stares at Adam with her adorable green eyes. She takes his hand.
ADAM: I want you out my house. Adam walks out the back door. Seth enters the kitchen and gets in Rachel's face. He stares her down.
SETH: Shame on you. Seth exits out the back door.
SETH: Your skin is the canvas upon which my dreams are painted?
ADAM: ( DISGUSTED )
SETH: ( BEAT )
ADAM: You remember the last time we came out here?
SETH: Prom night. How could I forget? Jen Zabrowski went down on me right where you're sitting.
ADAM: That memory is so far from me,
SETH: Jen giving me a blow job?
ADAM: No, prom night. It feels like a lifetime ago. I know it happened, but that's it. It's like someone else's memory. Adam stares out at the ocean. Reality check.
SETH: You okay? Adam throws his beer bottle into the ocean.
ADAM: I can't believe this is all actually happening.
SETH: The girl or the cancer?
ADAM: It's some pretty fucked up shit.
SETH: It's some pretty fucked up shit.
ADAM: You know, I used to think that I was actually going to spend the rest of my life with Rachel.granted that might not be so far off. ( shakes his head ) What a waste. Seth puts his arm around him.
SETH: We need to get you laid.
ADAM: ( ANNOYED )
SETH: Seriously, who's going to have sex with me?
ADAM: Seriously, who's going to have sex with me?
SETH: Some girls are into it?
ADAM: I look like Powder.
SETH: Then let's go get me laid. Seth stands, and then stumbles. He's really drunk.
ADAM: I think I should drive.
SETH: You don't have a license.
ADAM: You're drunk.
SETH: Do you even know how to drive?
ADAM: How hard can it be?
SETH: Hard enough that you don't have a This might be my last chance.
ADAM: ( SOMBER )
SETH: Driving! You care about driving! We could be on Everest getting high on Ayahuasca with Sherpas, and you want to drive!.Forget it, I give up. Drive. The two get off the boat and climb into Seth's car. Adam puts the key in the ignition. Without checking the mirrors, he backs the car up. BOOM the car slams into a giant statue of Neptune riding a sea horse.
ADAM: What? I didn't see it.
SETH: That's what the mirrors are for. Adam pulls out of the parking lot.
ADAM: I know what I'm doing. Adam turns left onto a one way street. It's the wrong way.
SETH: Apparently not. YOU'RE GOING THE
WRONG WAY!: An oncoming car honks and swerves out of the way - only nearly avoiding a head on collision.
ADAM: No. I'm driving and I want to go this way. Another car swerves out of the way.
SETH: What the fuck is wrong with you?
ADAM: For once can you just shut up and let me do this? So I'm driving the wrong way? Big fucking deal. Seth pulls the emergency brake. The car stops abruptly.
SETH: You're an idiot. A beat.
ADAM: Get out.
SETH: This is my car. Adam looks like he's about to erupt.
ADAM: GET! OUT! Seth looks at Adam speechless, and then gets out of the car.
GET! OUT!: Seth looks at Adam speechless, and then gets out of the car.
SETH: You're being a real douche. Adam locks the doors and sits quietly for a moment. He then proceeds scream at the top of his lungs. 25 years worth of suppressed emotions come out. Adam pulls out his cell phone. Seth notices. He tries to open the door. It's locked.
ADAM: Well you're a selfish piece of shit who cares more about getting his dick wet than actually being a Seth looks hurt. Adam holds the phone up to his head.
KATIE: ( ASLEEP )
ADAM: I don't want to die.
KATIE: Katie sits up. She's awake now.
ADAM: I'm 25 years old and I've never even been to Canada. I haven't lived my life!
KATIE: I know.
ADAM: I'm sorry for the way I acted. I should have never stormed out like It was wrong of me to push you the way I did. I wasn't listening.
KATIE: It was wrong of me to push you the way I did. I wasn't listening.
ADAM: You mean like a complete asshole? Katie laughs. And then silence, she really cares about him.
KATIE: I think you're really brave.
ADAM: If I don't die, I think we should go on a date.
KATIE: Adam, I'm not sure if that's a good Why not?
ADAM: Why not?
KATIE: Not only am I your therapist, but you're also my first patient, ever. What kind of precedent would I be It makes for a nice incentive.
ADAM: It makes for a nice incentive.
KATIE: I can't date you.
ADAM: ( PLAYFUL )
KATIE: No I can't.
ADAM: Yes, you can.
KATIE: No I can't.
ADAM: A wise person once told me - you can't change the wind, but you can adjust the sails.
KATIE: ( LAUGHS )
ADAM: ( COY )
KATIE: Adam? Adam? Adam?
ADAM: Good night.
SETH: Lying in bed, Adam hears a strange noise, he tilts his head to the side to see Seth breathing heavily and staring at him.
ADAM: ( UNCOMFORTABLE )
SETH: Watching you sleep.
ADAM: It's a little creepy.
SETH: I know. I can't help it. Seth lays back on his pillow and holds onto Adam's hand. They both stare up at the ceiling - terrified about the future.
SALES CLERK: Sir can I help you with anything ( holds up suit ) You think this is a good suit to wear to your own funeral?
ADAM: ( holds up suit ) You think this is a good suit to wear to your own funeral?
SALES CLERK: No, what you want is on level 3.
MORTICIAN: Here at Linden we're more than just a stopping ground for the deceased. We understand that life is different for everyone, and helping families to see their loved ones off to the hereafter means approaching every funeral and burial with it's own dignity and care.A funeral is a representation of the individuals time spent on earth, so I ask you to reflect on your inevitable interment and think carefully in choosing the service and tomb that best befits you.
SETH: What about a Viking funeral?
MORTICIAN: ( INTRIGUED )
SETH: ( talking out of his ass ) You know, we put him on a boat. cover it with.dirt and.branches.whatever you can find. We push it out.into the sea.or the ocean.and then shoot flaming arrows, boom! It catches on fire.And that's it. It's awesome. The Mortician stops and looks at Seth. He's not even going to dignify Seth with a reply. A beat.
MORTICIAN: ( points to grave plot ) Here you are, the Schwartz family Adam and Seth look at the rows of Schwartz family tombstones. Up front is an empty gap, presumably where Adam and his parents are to go. Adam and Seth stare at the graves as we:
DR. LAMB: Good morning Adam, how are you feeling? Good. Good. Good. Good. Despite Dr. Lamb's already thick glasses, he holds Adam's medical chart right up to his to his face.
ADAM: What is all this?
NURSE WONG: Hospital liability and disclaimer forms.in case they need to fuse your spine or remove any organs. You know, the usual.
ADAM: Oh, great.
NURSE WONG: You have some visitors. As Nurse Wong exits, Edith and Art enter.
EDITH: There he is. Edith pulls a strip of pills out of her fanny pack. She hands them to Adam like she's slipping him illegal drugs.
ADAM: ( PERPLEXED )
EDITH: I know isn't it great? Adam looks at his mother, perplexed by her logic.
ADAM: ( SHRUGS )
ART: I gotta new coat.
ADAM: That's great dad.
ART: Brooks Brothers. Silk pockets. Adam sticks his hand inside the pocket of Art's coat.
ADAM: I am feeling.
ART: I love you son.
ADAM: I love you too dad. Katie knocks on the door.
KATIE: Katie slowly enters holding a bouquet of flowers. Edith examines her. This is too awkward.
ADAM: Egh em. Mom. Mom. Adam nods for his mother to leave.
EDITH: Alright. Come on Art, let's go to the waiting room. On her way out, Edith turns to Katie and notices a CROSS around her neck.
KATIE: I brought you flowers. Not sure why, I didn't know what else-
ADAM: They're great, thank you. Katie sits on the bed next to Adam.
KATIE: So how you doing?
ADAM: I'm a little freaked out. A small GERMAN ANESTHESIOLOGIST enters. There is something incredibly unsettling about her thick accent.
ANESTHESIOLOGIST: Hello Adam, I am the Anesthesiologist. I will give you shot to make you sleep. Adam holds Katie's hand.
ADAM: Will you be here when I wake up?
KATIE: I'm not going anywhere.
ANESTHESIOLOGIST: Now relax, this will take a few minutes to feel the effect. The Anesthesiologist injects the drugs into Adam's IV.
ADAM: ( TERRIFIED )
ANESTHESIOLOGIST: Relax, you will soon begin the Well what if it doesn't work. How do you know I won't wake in the middle of the surgery? What if I- Just like that, Adam's out cold.
ADAM: Well what if it doesn't work. How do you know I won't wake in the middle of the surgery? What if I- Just like that, Adam's out cold.
DR. HENRY: I'm telling you Sir Francis Drake was a Buccaneer.
DR. LAMB: No he was a privateer.
NURSE SCOTT: I thought he was a pirate.
DR. LAMB: A pirate works for no one but himself. A privateer has a mandate from a government.
DR. HENRY: I thought that was a buccaneer.
DR. LAMB: No, a buccaneer is a butcher turned DR. HENRY Then what's a mercenary?
DR. HENRY: Then what's a mercenary?
DR. LAMB: ( FRUSTRATED )
DR. LAMB: We were successful in the extraction of the tumor. However, as you can imagine, with something of this magnitude.there were some unforeseen complications. The bone corrosion was much greater than initially anticipated. We had to remove part of the hip and pelvis, as well as most of the psoas muscle. We also had to remove a good amount of sheath tissue around the sciatic nerve, the damage to that nerve is considerable, which is going to hinder his ability to walk.He's in stable condition right now, but it's touch and go.
ADAM: That is the most beautiful dresses. Where did you get it? Dr. Lamb enters.
DR. LAMB: Adam, I see you're awake.
ADAM: I'm here.
DR. LAMB: How are you feeling?
ADAM: I feel wonderful.
DR. LAMB: That would be the morphine. Dr. Lamb picks up a handle that's attached to the morphine drip and sticks it in Adam's hand.
ADAM: Art and Edith enter the room. Adam reacts like a little kid being picked up from pre-school.
EDITH: ( CRYING )
ADAM: Remember the time you walked in on me masturbating?.That was so awkward.What hotel is this? We need to go on more vacations. Katie pops her head out from behind Adam's parents.
PAIN! PAIN!: Squeeze the morphine trigger! Adam squeezes the trigger. The morphine offers immediate relief. He lays back in total bliss, and then.
KATIE: Squeeze the morphine trigger! Adam squeezes the trigger. The morphine offers immediate relief. He lays back in total bliss, and then.
MARGARET: ( STARTLED )
ADAM: You must be Margaret.
MARGARET: Yes, I'm looking for Adam Schwartz.
ADAM: That's me.
MARGARET: ( face lights up ) You're Adam? The way Mitch described you, I always assumed you to be much older. About 50 years older. But, you're just a baby. Adam blushes.
ADAM: I'm so glad you could make it.
MARGARET: Me too.
ADAM: Please come inside. You're just in Adam leads Margaret inside, past a dozen oversized boxes.
ADAM: ( TO MARGARET )
MARGARET: ( LAUGHS )
ADAM: It's really easy. One button does Edith chimes in from across the room.
EDITH: This food's not going to eat Everyone makes their way to the table. Visibly weak, Adam slowly lifts himself out of the wheelchair. He yelps in pain. Katie starts to help when Seth intervenes.
SETH: I got it. Seth grabs hold of Adam, and with his help, Adam takes a small step and then lowers himself into his seat at the table. Katie places a pillow behind Adam's back. Adam takes Katie's hand, she looks down at him, they exchange a smile. Adam notices and open window.
ADAM: ( TO SETH )
SETH: ( as he serves Adam ) Nope. You don't have cancer anymore. No more special treatment.
ADAM: I am still in remission.
EDITH: You gonna spend the rest of your life complaining?
ADAM: ( PROUD )
