REVISED: September 23, 1991
SANCHEZ: Your Majesty would wish to know the true facts concerning the island of Hispanola, our first settlement in the New World, and the activities there of your servant, Christopher Columbus, Admiral of the Ocean Sea, Governor of that Island. You will remember with what hopes and promises he beguiled us the truth is that he now presides over a state of chaos, degradation and madness beyond imagining. SANCHEZ punctuates each word carefully.
SANCHEZ: From the beginning, Columbus proved himself incapable of managing the affairs of the island. He appointed his brothers to important positions, at once injuring the pride and dignity of the nobles who had gone with him. He promised to build a city, the City of Isabel, named after Your Majesty. What he actually built was nothing but a collection of huts, and that in the wrong place, for all of it was easily swept away by rain and mud. Is that not so, Brother Buyl? The PRIEST nods.
BROTHER BUYL: Yes, Your Honor.
SANCHEZ: He promised gold. Not finding the easy quantities he promised, Columbus commanded each Indian to pay an annual tribute. Most being unable to, they were barbarously punished, against the express wish of Your Christian Majesties. ISABEL lowers her eyes.
SANCHEZ: Since provocation and injustice never ceases, many of the Indians have fled to the forests, or have begun to slay the Christians. ISABEL looks over at BROTHER BUYL.
ISABEL: Could it be so?
BROTHER BUYL: Yes, Your Majesty.
SANCHEZ: But there is worse. From the beginning, he forced the nobles to undergo physical labor, treating them equally with the Indians, all of them reduced to slavery. When the nobleman Adrian de Moxica protested against such treatment. . he was executed. Is that not true also, Brother Yes, Your Honor. It is all true. All of it. I saw it with my own He has lost control. His great arrogance has led him into depravity. He encourages our soldiers to marry the native women. He promised a paradise, but he has made a hell full of all its horrors. Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Yes, Your Majesty.
BROTHER BUYL: Yes, Your Honor. It is all true. All of it. I saw it with my own He has lost control. His great arrogance has led him into depravity. He encourages our soldiers to marry the native women. He promised a paradise, but he has made a hell full of all its horrors. Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Yes, Your Majesty.
SANCHEZ: He has lost control. His great arrogance has led him into depravity. He encourages our soldiers to marry the native women. He promised a paradise, but he has made a hell full of all its horrors. Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Yes, Your Majesty.
ISABEL: Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Yes, Your Majesty.
SANCHEZ: Yes, Your Majesty.
COLUMBUS: FERNANDO runs over. COLUMBUS lifts him up onto the mule. As they move along the track we now see, perched on a distant hill, isolated and austere, the Monastery of La Rabida, their destination.
FERNANDO: He rushes over, full of joy, to kiss his BROTHER an adolescent dressed in the novice-robe, with a solemn, delicate face. DIEGO'S response is constrained.
COLUMBUS: Diego! Aren't you going to kiss your brother? DIEGO smiles a little, and kisses FERNANDO who is immediately distracted by a procession of hooded MONKS, hurrying to the refectory, as a bell begins to chime. The MONKS all turn to greet ANTONIO DE MARCHENA, a white- haired, elderly man and a monk cosmographer. MARCHENA'S gesture is broad and elegant as he opens his arms to greet COLUMBUS. He pats FERNANDO'S head and turns to DIEGO.
MARCHENA: Diego, take Fernando to the dining hall. He must be hungry.
DIEGO: Yes, Father. Both CHILDREN leave under the arched roof. COLUMBUS and MARCHENA begin to walk across the cloister.
MARCHENA: Diego is a bright boy a pleasure to teach but so serious. Brothers should be raised together, Colon. Even brothers from different Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him. And he has the teacher I would have chosen for MARCHENA laughs at the compliment.
COLUMBUS: Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him. And he has the teacher I would have chosen for MARCHENA laughs at the compliment.
MARCHENA: Just be careful you don't lose him. They have crossed the cloister. MARCHENA pushes open a INT. A HUGE LIBRARY - LA RABIDA - DAY Hundreds of books lined up on the shelves, displaying the miracle of printing, a recent German discovery. Several MONKS, perched on high stools behind lecterns, are busily "ILLUMINATING" some of these massive volumes, delicately painting around the letters in bright colors and gold Rays of light fall diagonally through high openings, projecting geometric patterns on the tiled floor. As MARCHENA and COLUMBUS move forward their conversation is punctuated by light and shadow.
MARCHENA: ( fumbles in a pocket under his robe ) I have something for you. Almost casually, he hands COLUMBUS a letter.
MARCHENA: You will be heard at the University of Salamanca. COLUMBUS stops dead in his tracks. Almost frantically he tears open the letter, hardly able to believe his eyes.
COLUMBUS: God. That's in a week!
MARCHENA: That's what it says.
COLUMBUS: How did you manage it?
MARCHENA: ( smiling ) With some difficulty. I had to promise them you were not a total MARCHENA pushes open a second door, hidden behind a wooden INT. STUDY - LA RABIDA - DAY MARCHENA is not a tidy man. Books are piled up on the floor, the desk, on every shelf, along with maps, instruments of astronomy. the visible evidence of an inquiring mind. With practiced familiarity, as if they had done this a hundred times which indeed they have MARCHENA sits behind his desk, and COLUMBUS opposite him. MARCHENA lights a candle and considers the mess. Then methodically, he slowly sweeps it from in front of him with his sleeve, exposing a large map underneath. When he looks up again, there is a new severity in his expression. He turns over an hourglass.
MARCHENA: Why do you wish to sail west?
COLUMBUS: To open a new route to Asia. At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it. He leans forward, and points to the map spread out on the By sea, sailing around the African Continent the journey takes a His finger traces the journey, from west to east.
COLUMBUS: By sea, sailing around the African Continent the journey takes a His finger traces the journey, from west to east.
COLUMBUS: Or by land. We are CLOSE now on the map, as we watch his finger tracing a line between Europe and the Far East.
COLUMBUS: By sailing West across the Ocean CLOSE ON MARCHENA'S FACE, touched by the mystery.
MARCHENA: How can you be so certain? The Ocean is said to be infinite.
COLUMBUS: Ignorance! I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
MARCHENA: How can you be so certain?
COLUMBUS: The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras.
MARCHENA: ( interrupting ) Esdras is a Jew.
COLUMBUS: So was Christ! MARCHENA throws his quill in the air in frustration. He glances at the hourglass:
MARCHENA: Two minutes. and already you're a dead man. Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
COLUMBUS: ( mockingly ) I'll try to remember that, Father Marchena!
MARCHENA: Father Marchena!
COLUMBUS: ( ignoring this ) Passion is something one cannot ( heatedly ) You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
MARCHENA: ( heatedly ) You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
COLUMBUS: I've been contradicted all my life. Eternity!
MARCHENA: ( amused ) Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
COLUMBUS: COLUMBUS walks over to him, squats down so their eyes meet. He looks at his SON for a moment.
COLUMBUS: Would you like to come and stay with Uncomfortable with the proposition, DIEGO cannot find an I'll do whatever makes you happy.
COLUMBUS: I'll do whatever makes you happy.
DIEGO: I am happy, Father. COLUMBUS reaches out and touches his shoulder. He climbs up behind FERNANDO, who waves back to his BROTHER as they ride off.
FERNANDO: Look, Father! Before COLUMBUS can stop him, FERNANDO has slipped off the mule and into the crowd.
COLUMBUS: But the BOY has been swallowed into the mass of people. COLUMBUS tries to follow him. Flames leap into the night sky with a terrible crackling, lighting up the square with a lurid glow. Prayers are being chanted somewhere. FERNANDO has elbowed his way to the front of the crowd. A PRIEST brandishes a crucifix in front of the face of a MAN bound to a post. The heretic wears the "sambenito", a robe made of coarse fabric on which his sins have been crudely illustrated we see cabalistic signs, indicating that the man is Jewish. THE MAN'S eyes are mad with fear. But he refuses to kiss the crucifix, as a sign of his repentance. FERNANDO is transfixed by the scene, but still doesn't realize what is happening. He is too close to the platform to see what is in the flames of the other pyres.
COLUMBUS: He motions to his son, takes the BOY'S hand, and drags him away from the scene. But FERNANDO looks back. The distance now allows him to see inside the flames. A HALF-CHARRED FIGURE THE MAN'S face is distorted in a silent scream. The neck snaps like burning wood, and the head falls on one shoulder. Then the whole body collapses into the fire.
COLUMBUS: Executions. In the square. BEATRIX nods. He goes to the stone butt and pours water on his hands.
COLUMBUS: They've agreed to see me in a week. BEATRIX puts the candle on the table. Her face lights up with a smile. He walks to her, and kisses her.
COLUMBUS: I could be gone for years.
BEATRIX: I know.
COLUMBUS: I haven't given you much of a life.
BEATRIX: ( amused ) Well. that's true. I have a child by a man who won't marry me! Who's always leaving.
COLUMBUS: Are we going to argue?
BEATRIX: I'd love to argue with you sometimes. But you're never here! They laugh and kiss.
COLUMBUS: Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman.
BEATRIX: ( still kissing him ) I find that hard to believe.
COLUMBUS: Fernando, don't you think we are lucky to live with such a beautiful He winks at FERNANDO. BEATRIX smiles.
MONK: ( hesitant ) Christopher Columbus?
AROJAZ: You say Asia can be found by sailing Yes, your Eminence. The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
COLUMBUS: Yes, your Eminence. The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
AROJAZ: Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle? Erathostene? Ptolemeus?
COLUMBUS: I am, Your Eminence
AROJAZ: Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is 22,000 leagues or more. Which makes the ocean. uncrossable. He leans back, satisfied, and pauses for effect.
AROJAZ: But you may have found new evidence proving that these men of knowledge are totally mistaken! A ripple of mirthless laughter.
COLUMBUS: Your Excellencies are aware of the statements of Marin de Tyr?
COLUMBUS: Then you are also aware that his theories contradict Ptolemeus. De Tyr believes the Ocean to be only 750 leagues. A murmur of protest spreads among the members of the Commission. But Columbus is determined to press his The Florentine Toscanelli and the French Cardinal Pierre d'Ailly both think that Marin de Tyr is accurate in his calculations. And therefore, that the ocean can be crossed. Indignant and amused murmurs. DIEGO DE DEZA raises his voice to quiet the assembly.
COLUMBUS: The Florentine Toscanelli and the French Cardinal Pierre d'Ailly both think that Marin de Tyr is accurate in his calculations. And therefore, that the ocean can be crossed. Indignant and amused murmurs. DIEGO DE DEZA raises his voice to quiet the assembly.
COLUMBUS: Seven weeks. Six, during the summer The murmur increases.
AROJAZ: Marin de Tyr is wrong and has been corrected many times over the centuries by the finest geographers. Your voyage, Don Colon, would take a A MAN of simple bearing, that COLUMBUS identifies as being a seaman, interrupts.
VICUNA: How would the crew survive without being able to land for fresh water? Water is undrinkable after six weeks! You'd never be able to turn We wouldn't have to turn back! We would find land at this point!
COLUMBUS: We wouldn't have to turn back! We would find land at this point!
AROJAZ: Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew. I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
COLUMBUS: Excellency, you are right. Instantly, the protests stop.
COLUMBUS: I am a seaman, not a scholar. But as a simple man craving for knowledge, I have read all the work of these renowned geographers and discovered that none of them could agree on the exact width of this He pauses, and starts walking in front of the experts, as a lawyer before a grand jury.
COLUMBUS: Therefore, as a modest man, I wonder: who is right? The experts listen. CLOSE ON SANCHEZ'S FACE, impressed by the boldness.
COLUMBUS: Who is right? This question remains He walks and stops before TALAVERA, and catches the look of SANCHEZ, sitting just behind him.
COLUMBUS: Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter. And that is to make the journey. I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.
AROJAZ: Your life, and that of others!
COLUMBUS: If they agree to follow me, yes.
COLUMBUS: Trade, Your Excellency. According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
AROJAZ: ( interrupting ) Is that all that interests you? No. The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people. I, too, will find other populations and bring them to the word of God. THE MONK smiles thinly.
COLUMBUS: No. The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people. I, too, will find other populations and bring them to the word of God. THE MONK smiles thinly.
AROJAZ: Christopher Christo Ferens the Bearer of the Cross!
MONK: ( ironic ) And Colon the one who populates! Another small rill of laughter.
AROJAZ: If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world? A hum of interest. CLOSE ON SANCHEZ watching COLUMBUS intently, a hint of an admiring smile on his lips.
COLUMBUS: Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world? A hum of interest. CLOSE ON SANCHEZ watching COLUMBUS intently, a hint of an admiring smile on his lips.
AROJAZ: So you consider yourself the chosen A pause.
AROJAZ: Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
COLUMBUS: ( calmly ) Blind faith is what I consider The murmur turns to an audible gasp. AROJAZ gets to his feet and leans forward, threateningly, the flame of a candle only inches from his face. There is absolute silence. COLUMBUS meets the MONK'S gaze ( quietly ) Asia can be found to the west and I will prove it.
COLUMBUS: ( quietly ) Asia can be found to the west and I will prove it.
AROJAZ: EXT. TERRACE - UNIVERSITY - DAY The JURY is alone to deliberate. Food and wine has been laid out on tables. In the distance, students' cries carry over the conversation. SANCHEZ approaches.
AROJAZ: The Treasurer of Spain honors us with his presence. SANCHEZ bows slightly.
SANCHEZ: The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence.
AROJAZ: The Judgment is ours!
SANCHEZ: Naturally. But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a. dispute over a point of geography. SANCHEZ helps himself to some grapes, looks round at the other members of the committee, who pretend not to be He is a mercenary! Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
AROJAZ: ( interrupting ) He is a mercenary! Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
SANCHEZ: Indeed. The world is full of mercenaries and states often make use of them, when it benefits them. My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain. AROJAZ understands the hint, and stops smiling.
AROJAZ: You would use your influence to assist this. intriguer? SANCHEZ reaches for a decanter of sherry.
SANCHEZ: You know, Your Eminence, the fascinating thing about power, is that what can be given so He offers the decanter to AROJAZ, who automatically lifts his glass. But instead, SANCHEZ pulls back the decanter, pours himself a drink, and replaces it on the table, leaving AROJAZ staring at his own empty glass.
SANCHEZ: . can so easily be taken away. And he drinks with a smile.
MARCHENA: . and therefore nothing could justify the participation of Your Highnesses in the venture that relies upon such feeble assumptions, and which any man of knowledge would take to be impractical. if not impossible. He shakes his head, puts the letter down. COLUMBUS looks appalled; devastated.
COLUMBUS: They didn't listen. They didn't want to listen! He paces about the book-lined room.
MARCHENA: You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
COLUMBUS: Wait! I've waited seven years already! How much longer do you want me to wait?
MARCHENA: If God intends you to go, then you will go.
COLUMBUS: ( angrily ) Damn God! MARCHENA is shocked.
MARCHENA: Damn all of you! You all set up theories based on what? You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out! Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to! He seizes a beautiful book from MARCHENA'S desk.
COLUMBUS: Damn all of you! You all set up theories based on what? You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out! Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to! He seizes a beautiful book from MARCHENA'S desk.
COLUMBUS: These don't mean anything! They're full of assumptions! Out of the heads of old men who've never been past the end of their gardens! He hurls the book across the room. MARCHENA is horrified.
MARCHENA: No.! My books.! COLUMBUS seizes more books from the shelves, just sweeping them to the floor.
COLUMBUS: All of them! Just lies!
MARCHENA: Colon! Don't! MARCHENA tries to stop him. In his fury, COLUMBUS accidentally knocks the poor old MAN to the ground. His cries bring three MONKS rushing into the room. As COLUMBUS continues to rage and scatter books everywhere, they try to stop him, struggling with this big, powerful man to almost comical effect. Finally, a short, muscular MONK delivers a quick punch that sends COLUMBUS crashing to the floor.
FERNANDO: Sssshhhh.! One can't speak to a man doing penance.
DIEGO: Sssshhhh.! One can't speak to a man doing penance.
FERNANDO: What can you do?
DIEGO: Nothing. That's the point, A pause and then FERNANDO lies face down on the floor beside his FATHER, and stretches out his arms in the same way. DIEGO is left looking on, unable to bring himself to join them.
PINZON: Ah, thank God! I've been looking all over Seville for you! Never expected to find a sailor in a monastery, eh? He laughs. COLUMBUS smiles, but doesn't say anything. PINZON is clearly a little surprised.
PINZON: Name's Pinzon, by the way. Martin Alonzo Pinzon. I'm a ship owner from Palos. COLUMBUS glances around cautiously, and walks a little way down the cloister, away from the other MONK, gesturing for PINZON to follow him. PINZON is yet more surprised by this strange behavior.
PINZON: ( indicating the monk ) Is he a spy? COLUMBUS shakes his head. PINZON stares at him, What is it? Are you a Trappist? COLUMBUS shakes his head again.
PINZON: What is it? Are you a Trappist? COLUMBUS shakes his head again.
PINZON: Vow of silence.? Penance? COLUMBUS nods vigorously.
PINZON: Jesus! Just my luck! He takes off his hat, wiping his forehead with a silk Listen. I'll do the talking for both of us. You just nod. Agreed? Just as I do with the wife. COLUMBUS nods.
PINZON: Listen. I'll do the talking for both of us. You just nod. Agreed? Just as I do with the wife. COLUMBUS nods.
PINZON: I know that the Commission turned you down, right? What do you expect? You're a foreigner. But I want to help you. COLUMBUS gives him a glance like one throws a question in the air.
PINZON: You wonder why I believe in you? Hey, I am a seaman. And we don't like to be told where to go, and where not to go. COLUMBUS looks at him, and bursts out laughing. The other MONK looks round severely. COLUMBUS ducks behind a map, PINZON following him. PINZON lowers his voice.
PINZON: I don't look like it, but I have friends at the Court. The Treasurer of Aragon, for example. He finances me. His name's Santangel. Ever heard of him? COLUMBUS shakes his head, but looks increasingly interested by what he's hearing.
PINZON: He can get you an audience with the Queen! You know why.? She owes him money. That's how it is. You me the Queen the world and his mistress agreed? COLUMBUS nods.
PINZON: So. What do you say? COLUMBUS looks around, catches the disapproving face of the MONK, crosses himself, then speaks:
COLUMBUS: Where can I meet this man?
PINZON: ( indicating with a nod ) COLUMBUS turns and sees an elegant Lord in his fifties, examining the maps.
SANTANGEL: These people built Granada. Centuries ago! It is a great victory over the Moors, Don Colon and yet what a tragedy it is! The THREE HORSEMEN pass a procession of grateful PENITENTS, who are crawling on their knees, chanting psalms and flagellating themselves. At the head of the procession, HOODED PRIESTS carry a statue of the Virgin Mary swathed in silk and lace. The gates of the Alhambra Palace are in sight.
COLUMBUS: Is this a good time to meet her?
SANTANGEL: It couldn't be better. Victors can't say no. Bells are pealing triumphantly. The noise is tumultuous. They ride towards the magnificent palace.
SANTANGEL: Your Excellency. truly grateful. your help. as ever. SANCHEZ protests softly, and looks over at COLUMBUS, a half-smile forming on his lips. Then a DUENA appears, and motions for COLUMBUS to follow.
ISABEL: Rise.! Come forward! He approaches the window, stopping close to her. ISABEL scrutinizes him quickly.
ISABEL: I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no. But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity. And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.
COLUMBUS: ( bold ) No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors. ISABEL smiles, enjoying the lack of obsequiousness.
ISABEL: The ocean is uncrossable?
COLUMBUS: What did they say about Granada before today?
ISABEL: ( a beat ) That she was impregnable. ISABEL smiles again.
ISABEL: I cannot ignore the verdict of my Surely you can do anything you want. A direct challenge. She doesn't know what to make of this How little you know. This little hint of vulnerability subtly reverses their positions for a moment. Now we sense COLUMBUS scrutinizing her.
COLUMBUS: Surely you can do anything you want. A direct challenge. She doesn't know what to make of this How little you know. This little hint of vulnerability subtly reverses their positions for a moment. Now we sense COLUMBUS scrutinizing her.
ISABEL: How little you know. This little hint of vulnerability subtly reverses their positions for a moment. Now we sense COLUMBUS scrutinizing her.
COLUMBUS: May I speak freely?
ISABEL: ( with a smile ) You show no inclination to speak I know what I see. I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is. Who's not afraid. I see a women who thinks. "What if?".
COLUMBUS: I know what I see. I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is. Who's not afraid. I see a women who thinks. "What if?".
ISABEL: ( amused at his familiarity ) A woman? A slight pause.
COLUMBUS: Forgive me. but you're the only Queen I know. She bursts out laughing.
ISABEL: Then we are equal. since you are the only sailor I know! A beat.
ISABEL: How old are you, Senor Colon?
COLUMBUS: Thirty seven, Your Majesty. And Once again taken off guard, ISABEL flushes, and turns away slightly to hide it.
ISABEL: Thirty eight. A pause.
ISABEL: You will be informed of our COLUMBUS bows and goes to leave. As the DUENA opens the door for him, he turns back.
COLUMBUS: Actually, I thought you were younger than me! And he goes out, leaving her stunned.
ADMINISTRATOR: . and he demands. he DEMANDS to be made a Knight, with the right to bear the Golden Spurs! He will receive the title of Don Cristobal Colon which will be extended to his descendants for ever more. The ADMINISTRATOR looks up. He is reading the contract that COLUMBUS has proposed. SANCHEZ, his mouth full, gestures for him to continue.
SANCHEZ: Go on!
ADMINISTRATOR: He will be named Great Admiral of the Ocean Sea. Viceroy of the West Indies. Governor of all islands or lands discovered or as will be discovered with his help. The ADMINISTRATOR looks up again.
ADMINISTRATOR: The highest titles of nobility, Your Excellency! To an immigrant sheltered by monks! SANCHEZ gestures for the document. Wipes his mouth. Continues reading, calmly:
SANCHEZ: Furthermore he will receive one eight of all wealth or monies, precious gems, pearls, metals, spices and other lucrative sources conquered within the boundaries of his admiralty. He smiles, hands the document back.
SANCHEZ: It's very underdone.
ADMINISTRATOR: ( exploding ) Underdone! It's monstrous, No, the pheasant. It's almost raw. And he carries on eating.
SANCHEZ: No, the pheasant. It's almost raw. And he carries on eating.
SANCHEZ: You worry too much, Carvajal. The man will have to lower his demands. Believe me, he WILL!
COLUMBUS: I WON'T! A WOMAN'S HAND quietly, carefully opens a cover of a spy hole in the wall. Two beautiful eyes peer through a grille, into the next room. What they see: SANCHEZ and COLUMBUS together. COLUMBUS is visibly upset.
I WON'T!: A WOMAN'S HAND quietly, carefully opens a cover of a spy hole in the wall. Two beautiful eyes peer through a grille, into the next room. What they see: SANCHEZ and COLUMBUS together. COLUMBUS is visibly upset.
SANCHEZ: ( calmly ) We have considered your demands very carefully, Senor Colon. Your expectations are. excessive, in every way. COLUMBUS tightens his fists, tries to remain calm.
COLUMBUS: If I am right, my requests are fair! SANCHEZ holds up a document.
SANCHEZ: We have prepared our own contract. He offers the document to COLUMBUS, who takes it, scans it quickly, shakes his head.
COLUMBUS: NO.! I have waited too long, fought too hard. Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit! No. I will not be your servant! The eyes behind the screen the mouth, forming a little I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with I'm not bargaining!
SANCHEZ: NO.! I have waited too long, fought too hard. Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit! No. I will not be your servant! The eyes behind the screen the mouth, forming a little I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with I'm not bargaining!
COLUMBUS: NO.! I have waited too long, fought too hard. Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit! No. I will not be your servant! The eyes behind the screen the mouth, forming a little I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with I'm not bargaining!
SANCHEZ: I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with I'm not bargaining!
COLUMBUS: I'm not bargaining!
SANCHEZ: ( steely ) Then you are too ambitious. COLUMBUS leans over the table, faces him.
COLUMBUS: And were you never ambitious, Excellency? Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
SANCHEZ: ( abrupt ) If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will. COLUMBUS smiles.
COLUMBUS: If you can do that, Excellency I'll become a monk! He turns, strides towards the door. We hear a WOMAN'S muffled laughter. As COLUMBUS goes out, ISABEL appears through a secret door. SANCHEZ bows. ISABEL goes over to the window and looks out.
ISABEL: You were right, Don Sanchez. His demands could never be granted.
SANCHEZ: Never, Your Majesty. Although. She turns, questioningly, towards him.
SANCHEZ: . Although one may always renegotiate a contract. Especially signed by Royal Hands.
SANCHEZ: ( quietly ) . Into a monk.
ISABEL: ( with a smile ) Yes. It would be a pity, wouldn't ( turning to Sanchez ) Call him back!
COLUMBUS: All heads turn as if he were totally insane. He walks on as if nothing happened.
YEEEEEEES!: All heads turn as if he were totally insane. He walks on as if nothing happened.
COLUMBUS: She said yes.
BEATRIX: ( moved ) Thank God. She smiles. But he seems to be unable to share her If I ever come back, I swear I She crosses to him quickly, placing her hand gently on his ( softly ) I'm not asking you to swear to I don't want you to wait for me.
COLUMBUS: If I ever come back, I swear I She crosses to him quickly, placing her hand gently on his I'm not asking you to swear to I don't want you to wait for me.
BEATRIX: ( softly ) I'm not asking you to swear to I don't want you to wait for me.
COLUMBUS: I don't want you to wait for me.
BEATRIX: ( smiling ) That's something you can't decide. COLUMBUS kisses her.
COLUMBUS: Why not? FERNANDO points at the monsters. He pulls the boy to him.
COLUMBUS: There aren't any monsters, Fernando. The only monsters are in here. He takes a pen, and draws a smile on one of the terrible monsters, transforming it at once. FERNANDO laughs I want to go with you!
FERNANDO: I want to go with you!
COLUMBUS: There'll be a time.
FERNANDO: You promise? Do you swear on St. Christopher.? FERNANDO pulls the chain with the St. Christopher medal from under COLUMBUS' shirt.
FERNANDO: Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
COLUMBUS: ( laughing ) Yes. Yes, I do. On all of them! And he hugs his SON tightly.
MARCHENA: In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
COLUMBUS: Forgive me, Father. For I have MARCHENA recognizes COLUMBUS' voice.
MARCHENA: I am listening, my son.
COLUMBUS: Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men. And I betrayed What are you saying?
MARCHENA: What are you saying?
COLUMBUS: I lied. The journey will be longer than I said.
MARCHENA: How long?
COLUMBUS: I am not sure. It could be twice the distance. A pause.
MARCHENA: May God forgive you.! You must tell them! You must tell your men!
COLUMBUS: If I tell them, they won't follow me. You know that I am right, Father. You trust me.
MARCHENA: My son, my son. Your certitudes are sometimes Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
COLUMBUS: You are bound by an oath, Father. A long silence.
MARCHENA: I believed in you.
COLUMBUS: Give me absolution. No response.
COLUMBUS: Give me absolution, Father! Devastated, MARCHENA reluctantly makes the sign of the EXT. HARBOR AND SHIPS - PALOS - DAWN COLUMBUS walks over to where BEATRIX and FERNANDO are waiting. He kisses and hugs FERNANDO.
COLUMBUS: Be good to your mother, Fernando. Do you promise? FERNANDO nods, tears in his eyes. Then COLUMBUS embraces BEATRIX tightly. She whispers into his ear.
BEATRIX: Speak to Diego. But COLUMBUS and DIEGO are unable to find words, and instead they clumsily hug. Someone taps COLUMBUS' shoulder. He turns around to see SANTANGEL. Wordlessly, they hug.
COLUMBUS: Diego! Here! DIEGO catches it. Opening his hand he looks at the medallion. Then looks up at his FATHER, elated. THE SANTA MARIA is now two meters from the QUAY. SANTANGEL is now opposite COLUMBUS.
SANTANGEL: ( casually ) Take care of my investment, wherever you're going!
COLUMBUS: ( ambiguous ) I have to tell you Santangel. I don't know where on earth I am They both laugh. A FISHERMAN, standing in his shrimp-boat lets his hand slide gently along the gigantic hull. He stares up at the SAILORS leaning on the rail.
SAILOR: Vaya con Dios! ( Go with God! ) They wave back.
COLUMBUS: ( softly ) Due west, Captain Mendez. And may God be with us.
MENDEZ: God be with us admiral. MENDEZ doesn't move, continuing to observe COLUMBUS.
COLUMBUS: What is it Mendez? Speak! MENDEZ is hesitant. He nervously clears his throat.
MENDEZ: Well. It's the men, Sir. They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days And what do you think Mendez?
COLUMBUS: ( still taking readings ) And what do you think Mendez?
MENDEZ: Well, I surely know what a quadrant is! But I've never seen it used at night before.
COLUMBUS: Come over here. MENDEZ hesitates, then motions to COLUMBUS. The SAILORS are watching, and some approach to hear the conversation.
COLUMBUS: Now, find the North Star. Do you have it?
COLUMBUS: Don't move! A mistake of one degree and we'll be off 6,000 leagues! MENDEZ tries again.
COLUMBUS: What do you read?
MENDEZ: Twenty eight. MENDEZ turns to COLUMBUS.
COLUMBUS: That's it. The twenty eighth parallel. And we'll follow it until we reach land. ALONSO does not seem convinced.
ALONSO: How do you know land is on the twenty eighth parallel?
ALONSO: Chicken-ass face! The others laugh. The BOY, ashamed, tries to ignore them. ALONSO'S hand accidentally touches a brass fitting; he reacts like he was burnt.
ALONSO: He sucks his blistered fingers.
ALONSO: I never seen heat like this! Not even in Las Minas!
SAILOR: The water's going putrid in the You'll be drinking your own piss. For the glory of Spain. and Admiral Colon.! Bastard! The SHIP'S BOY glances round at them.
ALONSO: You'll be drinking your own piss. For the glory of Spain. and Admiral Colon.! Bastard! The SHIP'S BOY glances round at them.
ALONSO: What are you listening to, chicken Ah, leave him alone. He's doing no With a face like that? I don't want you looking at me. You The BOY turns away, dropping the bucket back into the sea.
SAILOR: Ah, leave him alone. He's doing no With a face like that? I don't want you looking at me. You The BOY turns away, dropping the bucket back into the sea.
ALONSO: With a face like that? I don't want you looking at me. You The BOY turns away, dropping the bucket back into the sea.
ALONSO: He's the devil's child.
SAILOR: We'll all go crazy. The BOY throws more water over the deck. A SAILOR takes his guitar, and starts singing an improvised song.
SAILOR: Culo de galina es el hijo del demonio. ( Chicken ass mouth is the devil's child. Born from the loins of a stinky old goat etc. ) They all laugh. The BOY, hearing this, climbs to the crow's-nest like a monkey.
ALONSO: We should have seen land.
SAILOR: We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
ALONSO: Can't be that far, I say. Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here. Smells like a cunt. Bad sign. The COOK starts laughing. They turn to him.
COOK: ( shaking his head ) Of course it smells like it! That's why sailors take to the sea! They all laugh. Alonso looks up at COLUMBUS standing on the poop deck, scrutinizing the horizon, waiting for the land to appear.
ALONSO: And why does this one take to the sea? Nobody knows. Never says a MENDEZ has sensed the danger of this lack of respect. He approaches them.
MENDEZ: To your post! At once! They split in silence.
SHIP'S BOY: Mark. Twenty nine, Sir! THE HOUR-GLASS runs out. COLUMBUS converts the mark into a daily average for distance and speed.
COLUMBUS: Six hundred and twenty nine. THE SHIP'S BOY cups his hands to his mouth to shout.
SHIP'S BOY: Six hundred and twenty nine! AN OFFICER turns to PINZON to repeat the message.
OFFICER: Six hundred and twenty nine, Sir! PINZON does not seem too pleased.
PINZON: I heard. THE OFFICER examines his own calculations.
OFFICER: Captain, I don't understand.
PINZON: I think I do. He goes back to his cabin.
MENDEZ: Continue rowing!
ALONSO: To where? ALONSO defiantly stares at MENDEZ. He then starts to beat a rhythm on the hull with his fist, followed by the others. In the two other boats, the MEN begin to follow suit, beating a rhythm of protest on the hulls. MENDEZ looks up to COLUMBUS, in panic. ON BOARD PINZON'S SHIP, an OFFICER cups his hands to his Captain Pinzon requests permission to board.
OFFICER: Captain Pinzon requests permission to board.
COLUMBUS: INT. COLUMBUS' CABIN - DAY PINZON enters. He looks furious.
PINZON: You lied! You cheated! We're way past 750 leagues!
COLUMBUS: ( calmly ) Six days ago, yes.
PINZON: You must be mad.!
COLUMBUS: We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
PINZON: We're on the verge of a mutiny, You think I don't know that?
COLUMBUS: You think I don't know that?
PINZON: We're lost!
COLUMBUS: The land is there. I know it!
PINZON: You don't know anything! Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning And then what? Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
COLUMBUS: And then what? Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
PINZON: ( apoplectic ) Jesus Maria! I should have never listened to you!
COLUMBUS: You never did. You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
PINZON: You bloody.
COLUMBUS: Pinzon, Pinzon. All we can do now is go forward! Think about that!
PINZON: You tell that to them!
COLUMBUS: You're right. Let the men decide. COLUMBUS moves to the door. As an afterthought, he takes his scarlet-embroidered jacket from a hook.
COLUMBUS: Who gave you the order to come on He looks up and down the line, finishing on ALONSO. They stare at one another.
ALONSO: God doesn't want us to cross the ocean.! This voyage is cursed! Some of the MEN murmur their agreement.
COLUMBUS: We set sail for greed. God has abandoned us. The voyage is cursed. There are signs. ALONSO glances towards the SHIP'S BOY, with his hair lip. The BOY lowers his eyes. COLUMBUS moves towards him, pulls him forward, stands him in front of ALONSO.
ALONSO: We set sail for greed. God has abandoned us. The voyage is cursed. There are signs. ALONSO glances towards the SHIP'S BOY, with his hair lip. The BOY lowers his eyes. COLUMBUS moves towards him, pulls him forward, stands him in front of ALONSO.
COLUMBUS: This boy has the voice of an angel. What comes out of his mouth is blessed, Alonso. What comes out of your is evil. Some of the men laugh at this statement. ALONSO is ill at ease. COLUMBUS pauses, looks around at all the MEN.
COLUMBUS: Listen to me! Every man is afraid who does something for the first time. But those who overcome their fears, will find their rewards. I do not know if it is God's will that we cross this ocean but I am certain it is the devil who puts fears into our hearts. The MEN are listening. We sense a subtle change of This jacket to the first man who sights land! I want a man up that mast day and night. COLUMBUS points at the SHIP'S BOY.
COLUMBUS: This jacket to the first man who sights land! I want a man up that mast day and night. COLUMBUS points at the SHIP'S BOY.
COLUMBUS: You start first. The SHIP'S BOY rushes up the mast. As he climbs, the mainsail starts to fill with wind. The deck begins to move under their feet. This movement under their feet seems to imperceptibly erase the fears and the angers.
MENDEZ: Alonso! Jaime! Don't let this wind escape us. CRIES from the other ships, as the sails snap taut, filling with wind. MEN rush to their posts. PINZON stares at COLUMBUS, shaking his head in disbelief.
PINZON: ( murmuring ) You lucky bastard. COLUMBUS walks away to his cabin, then turning back to
COLUMBUS: Pinzon, the more I sail, the luckier I get. Turning abruptly, he enters his cabin.
MENDEZ: Shall I take my turn? COLUMBUS shakes his head no, and starts drinking from the COLUMBUS' head nods lower and lower to his chest. He is asleep. We become aware of a sharp buzzing sound. It becomes louder as we move closer to COLUMBUS' face. A mosquito lands on his temple. COLUMBUS reflexively slaps it. He wakes up, and looks at his fingers a spot of blood, a crushed mosquito. He stares at it for a moment. Then slowly gets to his feet.
COLUMBUS: ( murmuring ) Mendez! Mendez! MENDEZ grimaces, and opens one eye.
COLUMBUS: CUT TO: EXT. SHIP - DAWN An opaque dawn. COLUMBUS, riveted, staring forward as if to pierce the mist. The entire crew are clinging to the rail, and standing on the shrouds. Suddenly, the SHIP BOY'S voice cracking with emotion.
SHIP'S BOY: TIERRA.! TIERRA! COLUMBUS strains his eyes; he still can not see anything. The entire CREW stand and stare, silent, holding their As the sun begins to rise, the fog dissipates slowly, exquisitely, revealing a single palm, so close it seems almost as though they could touch it. Then a white slash of beach. Near COLUMBUS, a SAILOR falls to his knees and burst into tears. Others laugh with joy. COLUMBUS watches this vision in disbelief, his mouth open as if it were difficult for him to breathe. Tears come to his eyes. He closes them. Then opens them again. The land is there a green paradise. On screen the words: OCTOBER 12, 1942. GUANAHAN ISLAND
COLUMBUS: By the. by the Grace of. God. He swallows. Tears have sprung to his eyes. He is so moved he cannot continue. Coming to his rescue THE SHIP'S BOY starts to roll the drum. He then stops.
COLUMBUS: ( pulling himself together ) In the name of their Gracious Majesties of Castille and Aragon, and by all the powers vested in me, I claim this island and name it San The MEN cheer as the flags are rammed into the sand, flapping in the wind. COLUMBUS starts to walk towards the jungle, and in silence the rest follow.
MENDEZ: ( whispering urgently ) Several of them raise their weapons to their shoulders, pointing them into the jungle. From COLUMBUS' POV we slowly scan the face of the thick jungle ahead. For a moment we don't see anything and then, with a shock, we see the first INDIAN. Naked, painted like an idol, carrying a hunting lance. As if they had materialized from nowhere: the rest of the HUNTING PARTY, with their bows and spears. Silent. Watchful. They stare back at us. The SPANIARDS nervously finger their weapons. COLUMBUS slowly lifts his hand into the air: a clear signal not to fire. Then, removing his sword, he drops it on the ground, and starts to walk forward, fixing his gaze upon the first INDIAN he saw.
PINZON: ( warningly ) COLUMBUS ignores him, even though some of the INDIANS have raised their weapons. He stops in the no-man's land between them. The INDIANS don't move but something excites them. The SHIP'S BOY, wearing COLUMBUS' embroidered jacket and the drum, has followed COLUMBUS and now stands close to him. He is the cause of their interest. COLUMBUS puts his arm around the BOY, and this gesture of affection seems to put the INDIANS at their ease. They start talking and pointing. They come forward slowly, start to tentatively touch the BOY'S jacket. Then, now laughing, they touch COLUMBUS, pulling at his beard. COLUMBUS laughs too. Sensing their innocence, the rest of the MEN lower their weapons. Some of them laugh. An apparition: a beautiful young INDIAN GIRL, totally naked, walks out of the jungle. She is pregnant and holds a child. We begin to hear Indian music, played on a flute.
COLUMBUS: We have come here in peace, and we will behave with honor. They are not savages and neither will you be. Treat these people as you would your own wives and your own children. Neither are you free to take what you will; for a seashell you give a bandana. You will respect their beliefs. Pillage will be punished by the whip. Rape by the sword.
PINZON: Gold.! Gold! The INDIANS says the word in his own language, laughing. We see that some of the other INDIANS also have small gold PINZON repeats the INDIAN word for gold. The INDIAN removes the ornament from his nose, gives it to PINZON, who indicates that he wants to have it. The INDIAN nods but points to PINZON'S dagger, indicating that he wants it in return. PINZON shakes his head, stops the INDIAN from taking it.
COLUMBUS: ( to Pinzon ) Give it to him! PINZON looks at him, about to argue but COLUMBUS insists. PINZON takes out the dagger and offers it to the
PINZON: ( irritated ) By God! That's the worst trade of my life! His friends laugh. Innocently, the INDIAN has taken it by the blade. He yelps, looks down at the blood welling up. A moment of tension. Then MENDEZ laughs at his clumsiness, and the ELDERS laugh too. and the INDIAN Just outside this circle, we see the first INDIAN we saw, squatting on his haunches, watching. This is UTAPAN.
OLD INDIAN: Cuba! Cuba! THE OLD MAN nods, points into the distance, chatters away to UTAPAN.
UTAPAN: Say not here! Cuba!
COLUMBUS: What is it? A tribe? An island?
UTAPAN: Island. Far.
COLUMBUS: Help him! ALONSO is quiet and silent. His eyes are looking around at his companions. UTAPAN shakes his head. There is nothing he can do. ALONSO is now leaning back, supported by one of his friends. He has grabbed the forearm of a SAILOR. His look is already far away. His companion shouts at UTAPAN.
SAILOR: Do something! Help him!
UTAPAN: He dead. ALONSO starts convulsing. HIS FRIENDS hold him, desperate in their helplessness. Others simply move away, horrified. One of them cries.
COLUMBUS: Utapan! Wait! UTAPAN stops obediently, and rushes back to COLUMBUS with comical energy. On their way back, they find one SOLDIER sitting, leaning against a tree. He has removed his helmet. His hair sticking to his forehead. As COLUMBUS and UTAPAN walk back, they find another SAILOR, then another, then the whole group gathered around PINZON. Ashen, he burns with fever. He attempts a smile.
PINZON: Well. You'll have to continue without me. COLUMBUS looks around him what he sees: exhausted men and jungle, as far as one can see.
COLUMBUS: No. It's enough. What would you say to a drop of Jerez, Pinzon? PINZON grins.
PINZON: And a nice slice of Santa Fe lamb! I'd sell my soul for it. Help me up. I've got to piss, gold. They all laugh as the OFFICER helps PINZON to his feet. PINZON walks a few yards into the jungle starts to urinate. It is red. Suddenly dizzy, he reels and EXT. JUNGLE - DAY A line of SPANIARDS and INDIANS threading their way down a mountainside. PINZON is being carried on a makeshift stretcher. His eyes are closed, his face thick with They enter a village, to the surprise of the INDIANS. UTAPAN once again at the front as the ambassador.
UTAPAN: He cures. COLUMBUS nods he obviously trusts UTAPAN.
UTAPAN: ( to Columbus ) You come! You speak first!
COLUMBUS: Tell the Chief we thank him.
UTAPAN: Chief knows.
COLUMBUS: Tell him his country is very beautiful. Tell him we are leaving men here to build a fort. UTAPAN translates.
COLUMBUS: Tell him we will return very soon. Many of us. UTAPAN translates. The CHIEF GUARIONEX asks a simple Chief says how many?
UTAPAN: Chief says how many?
COLUMBUS: COLUMBUS doesn't seem to understand the question. For the first time he seems to be caught short.
UTAPAN: COLUMBUS doesn't seem to understand the question. For the first time he seems to be caught short.
COLUMBUS: To bring the word of God.
UTAPAN: Chief says he has a God.
COLUMBUS: ( pursuing ) . and also to bring medicine.
UTAPAN: Chief says.
COLUMBUS: ( interrupting ) He has medicine. ( pause ) Tell him we admire his people. UTAPAN translates.
UTAPAN: Chief says he knows you like his. And the CHIEF gets up, awards COLUMBUS with a smile, and walks out of the hut, the ELDERS following, leaving COLUMBUS alone.
COLUMBUS: ( with a little smile ) That's a beginning.
COLUMBUS: ( screaming to the sailors ) Get below! All of you! Go! The MEN start to scramble below decks.
COLUMBUS: ( to Mendez ) Stay with me! The ship rolls again. COLUMBUS and MENDEZ crawl towards the mast. Another gigantic wave crashes over them, tons of water falling like cement. They reach the mast. The wood groans.
COLUMBUS: We may have to cut it! MENDEZ nods. COLUMBUS grabs some rope. The ship rises into the air again, crashes down, the deck disappearing beneath them for a moment.
COLUMBUS: ( screaming out ) I'll stay here to decide if we cut it. Help me! With MENDEZ'S help, COLUMBUS is tied to the mast: one rope under his arms, the other around his waist. MENDEZ hands him a horn.
COLUMBUS: ( screaming ) Now go! MENDEZ seems to hesitate. COLUMBUS screams at him again.
COLUMBUS: I said below deck, Mendez! MENDEZ crawls away. Another huge wave washes over COLUMBUS. He emerges, almost suffocated. The storm rages, its eerie light making it seem at times like bright daylight. But as the lightning flashes, COLUMBUS begins to count:
COLUMBUS: One. two. three. four. There's an enormous thunderclap on "four" it indicates how close they are to the eye of the storm. The ship keels over again, dropping down and down, seeming never to rise. COLUMBUS lifts his head to the heavens, screams out:
COLUMBUS: Damn you! As if in answer, another flash of lightning that illuminates the sky and the sea. COLUMBUS starts counting One. two. three. four. Another terrible clap of thunder on "five" COLUMBUS starts laughing, knowing the storm is moving on. Then, in the strange light, something seems to move through the air towards him; it looks like some kind of projectile, a craft, with a trail of vapor. COLUMBUS stares up at it. amazed. We start to hear the "Te Deum", majestic and heavenly.

AROJAZ: It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
SANCHEZ: ( whispering ) On the contrary, Your Eminence. It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
COLUMBUS: You must not inhale, but simply allow the palate to enjoy the flavor of the Tobacco. He hands the cigar back to MOXICA. With a casual air, MOXICA himself inhales deeply almost chokes to death. He gulps down a glass of wine. much to the amusement of the others.
MOXICA: ( deeply embarrassed ) And you say this is an Indian vice? By God! I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
COLUMBUS: The Indians have no such word, Don Do they have such thoughts?
ISABEL: Do they have such thoughts?
COLUMBUS: They come and go as naked as the day God created them. ISABEL blushes slightly.
COLUMBUS: They don't see sin in their nakedness. They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. Forgive me, Don Colon. But what about gold? COLUMBUS nods, turns and whispers something to a SERVANT standing just behind his chair. The SERVANT goes to open the door and in comes UTAPAN, dressed as a tribesman, carrying a casket. The WOMEN around the table fan themselves furiously at the sight. UTAPAN puts the casket down in front of the QUEEN, and steps back.
SANCHEZ: ( interrupting ) Forgive me, Don Colon. But what about gold? COLUMBUS nods, turns and whispers something to a SERVANT standing just behind his chair. The SERVANT goes to open the door and in comes UTAPAN, dressed as a tribesman, carrying a casket. The WOMEN around the table fan themselves furiously at the sight. UTAPAN puts the casket down in front of the QUEEN, and steps back.
COLUMBUS: These are gifts for Your Majesty. ISABEL opens the casket, revealing the gleam of gold inside. She takes out some of the little golden ornaments. a bracelet and then the mask. She holds it, somehow moved by its crude beauty. ISABEL raises the mask to her face, looking across at
ISABEL: We are more than gratified. The guests laugh obsequiously. COLUMBUS bows a little looks up and meets the eyes of SANCHEZ, who is staring at him, coldly.
MASTER: Si! Si! Muy bien! Excellente! ( Yes! Yes! Good! Excellent! ) We discover the SWORD MASTER is fencing with COLUMBUS. A dozen duellists are practicing in the magnificent rotunda, surrounded with a two-tiered colonnade. Out of breath, COLUMBUS stops the exercise, and removes his protective canvas padding. He bows at his teacher, who salutes him in return. COLUMBUS walks to a tressel laden with food and beverages. SANCHEZ, in a fencing outfit and boots, is having a glass of wine. Upon seeing COLUMBUS approaching, he hands him a You defend yourself admirably.
SANCHEZ: You defend yourself admirably.
COLUMBUS: . for a commoner? SANCHEZ laughs and raises his glass.
SANCHEZ: To your second expedition. They drink. A short, somewhat ugly man, with some kind of imposing energy, approach them.
SANCHEZ: Don Colon Don Alonso de Bobadilla. A man who knows our BOBADILLA bows.
BOBADILLA: I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands? Is it not so?
COLUMBUS: Forgive me, Don Bobadilla those positions have already been taken.
BOBADILLA: ( disappointed ) May I ask by whom?
COLUMBUS: Bartolome and Giacomo Colon. SANCHEZ looks at him in surprise. BOBADILLA reddens.
BOBADILLA: I trust they are men of quality. BOBADILLA glances at SANCHEZ.
COLUMBUS: But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
SANCHEZ: ( amused ) Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
COLUMBUS: Good! We are also in need of judges. Except there are no A grin disfigures the face of BOBADILLA.
BOBADILLA: ( to Sanchez ) I see I was mistaken. Don Colon has no need for my services. And he walks off. SANCHEZ fills his mouth with a slice of ( amused ) You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
SANCHEZ: ( amused ) You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
COLUMBUS: What.? Do I have so many already?
SANCHEZ: ( seriously ) To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation. ( kindly ) A little hypocrisy goes a long way.
BARTOLOME: You might have given us a choice!
GIACOMO: Bartolome is stronger, more capable than I will ever be.
COLUMBUS: I need both of you. What are you afraid of? We are living what we always dreamt of.
GIACOMO: You know I never shared those dreams with you.
COLUMBUS: Are you saying you refuse to help? COLUMBUS looks at them with such pained surprise.
BARTOLOME: ( amused ) You bastard. you always had your own way.
COLUMBUS: Let me show you something. He opens the door to a terrace.
COLUMBUS: Of course. Of course. We'll see to it. Yes. Thank you. Soon. Fighting their way through, the BOTHERS press their way, reaching the other side of the gallery. We get glimpses of the incredible activity down below. ADMINISTRATORS, MILITARIES, MERCHANTS are busy around tressels covered with documents, plans, maps. preparing the second COLUMBUS puts his arms around them.
COLUMBUS: ( indicating the applicants ) Now you tell me. Who can I ( almost amused ) We're brothers! We must be a House. A bloodline! In this country one can't exist alone! I need you.! Both of you! He walks then to the balustrade. The cries from the courtyard down below subside. some of the applicants begin to look up, aware of his presence.
SOLDIER: Where is the Admiral? Has anyone seen the Admiral? Everybody laughs.
COLUMBUS: He is here! What is it? He leans over the balcony. In the middle of the overcrowded courtyard, the SOLDIER who was shouting is brandishing a document.
MAN: Admiral! The horses have arrived.
COLUMBUS: I know. I saw them! Who did we hire today? ANOTHER ASSISTANT raises his eyes.
ASSISTANT: Thirty blacksmiths, twenty eight halberdiers, twenty carpenters, a hundred farmers, twenty miners. and Doctor Chanca, the royal The royal surgeon? Then we can count on royal health! The whole courtyard bursts out laughing.
COLUMBUS: The royal surgeon? Then we can count on royal health! The whole courtyard bursts out laughing.
COLUMBUS: ( looking at his son ) He's growing up! BEATRIX smiles, nods. They walk on.
COLUMBUS: Beatrix, I want to ask you You don't usually ask.
BEATRIX: ( with a smile ) You don't usually ask.
COLUMBUS: ( after a pause ) I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service. BEATRIX stops in her tracks, looks at him.
COLUMBUS: It is a great honor. We could not hope for anything better. BEATRIX nods, but bites her lip, and looks back at
BEATRIX: For once I wish you weren't right. COLUMBUS puts his arm around her waist, pulling her closer, they move away.
MOXICA: Is this your new world, Don Colon? COLUMBUS looks around in dismay. A YOUNG NOBLEMAN, HERNANDO DE GUEVARA, takes out his sword.
GUEVARA: These animals should be shown what savagery can be! Other SPANIARDS join in, repeating this last word.
NOBLEMAN: Three heads for every life taken. No mercy before God!
GUEVARA: No mercy! Let's find them.
COLUMBUS: No Guevara. There will be no Silence. Everyone looks at COLUMBUS.
MOXICA: We lost cousins, friends. We will wash this in blood.
COLUMBUS: If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say. They are all listening.
COLUMBUS: Moxica, I lost friends too. Thirty nine brave men who trusted me. He walks among them.
COLUMBUS: You want a war? Fine. We are a thousand. They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill? Which tribe?
MOXICA: We don't need to know.
COLUMBUS: We came here to stay! To build! Not to start a crusade. In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days! So we will be brave and swallow our grief. And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.
UTAPAN: They here. Slowly, they begin to appear, one after the other materializing from the jungle. Shy and scared. They stare at this "Centaur" ( the HORSE and the HORSEMAN seem to be one a God ). To impress them even more, MOXICA makes the beast move sideways and backwards, rearing, its front hoofs pawing the air. THE INDIANS retreat in terror, except for one, who stands his ground, brandishing his lance. UTAPAN encourages the YOUNG WARRIOR to approach the centaur. He places his hand onto the shoulder of the animal. The muscles shudder. THE INDIAN jumps back comically, accompanied by the rest of the tribe. Without warning, MOXICA climbs down from the saddle. More INDIANS step back in fear and absolute astonishment. Now more have ventured from the jungle. The bravest of them approach MOXICA, daring to touch him, and the horse, retreating then touching until they fill the compound. At this moment, COLUMBUS and his SOLDIERS appear all around them, pointing their muskets, and their crossbows. A moment of tension. COLUMBUS walks forward, towards the CHIEF ( GUARIONEX ) we meet before.
COLUMBUS: Ask the Chief what happened to my The CHIEF answers.
UTAPAN: Another tribe made war on them. came by sea. took them away.
BROTHER BUYL: God have mercy on their souls.
MOXICA: The monkey is lying. A pause. The SPANIARDS shifting, eager for blood.
MOXICA: We should kill them, Don Colon. UTAPAN looks anxiously at COLUMBUS.
COLUMBUS: No.! you'll do it my way. Tell the Chief we will not harm his people, even though we have the power to do it. UTAPAN translates. The CHIEF listens in silence.
COLUMBUS: We will work with his people. We want peace. Ask the Chief if he He understands.
UTAPAN: He understands.
COLUMBUS: Ask him if he will help.
COLUMBUS: Don Moxica we need your horse. MOXICA looks down at the sodden, dirty figure.
COLUMBUS: We can't raise the wheel without it.
MOXICA: My horse doesn't work. A beat. COLUMBUS wipes some mud from his eyes.
COLUMBUS: Don Moxica we all have to work.
MOXICA: You did not hear me, Don Colon. Not my horse. He starts to turn away; COLUMBUS grabs hold of the reins.
COLUMBUS: Forgive me, Don Moxica. But it was your horse I was talking about. A beat. MOXICA stares down at an equally determined COLUMBUS. Then, in front of everyone, MOXICA has to dismount, and suffer the disgrace of it.
COLUMBUS: Thank you, Don Moxica. COLUMBUS leads the horse away.
MOXICA: To the Governor of the Mosquitoes! They laugh. We see the smoke and flames from a fire. Four or five INDIANS are squatting on the earth nearby, cooking for them, talking quietly in their own language. MOXICA calls out something in their language, and a naked YOUNG INDIAN GIRL comes out of the house, bringing more wine. GUEVARA stares at her lasciviously. MOXICA, letting his hand casually brush against her flank, smiles at him.
MOXICA: Do you want her? He turns the GIRL round so that GUEVARA can admire her properly. GUEVARA nods. MOXICA lets the GIRL go with a peremptory order, and she disappears back inside. GUEVARA suddenly stands up unsteadily and sweeping his arm round in a broad gesture, says ironically:
GUEVARA: To the new world, my friend! To the new world!
GIACOMO: ( as Nima pours the wine ) Nima's a good cook!
BARTOLOME: She's more than that! Seeing GIACOMO'S sudden blush and discomfort, as NIMA smiles at him, the other BROTHERS laugh. To cover his embarrassment, GIACOMO returns to the topic of the food.
GIACOMO: What is it?
COLUMBUS: Eat! I'll tell you later. As he sees BARTOLOME stifling a laugh, GIACOMO pauses.
GIACOMO: I'd like to know what I'm eating. COLUMBUS eats a mouthful, glances at BARTOLOME.
COLUMBUS: A look of horror crosses GIACOMO'S face; he wretches slightly, puts down his fork, and gulps down some wine. The BROTHERS laugh again.
COLUMBUS: What wrong with it? The Indians eat I'm not an Indian.
GIACOMO: I'm not an Indian.
BARTOLOME: He wishes he were back in the seminary. Priests always eat well. And they have very good cellars.
GIACOMO: Nothing grows here! Everything rots in the ground. The wheat and vines wither before we can harvest them.
COLUMBUS: We've got to learn to live like the Eat your Iguana! Reluctantly this time, GIACOMO goes back to his dinner.
COLUMBUS: How much gold have we found?
BARTOLOME: Not enough to justify a single Perhaps it doesn't exist anywhere but in my imagination.
COLUMBUS: Perhaps it doesn't exist anywhere but in my imagination.
BARTOLOME: Then let's hope not. What will happen if we can't find enough gold? They begin to hear the sound of a flute a melancholy sound. COLUMBUS looks out over the jungle, and kills a mosquito by slapping his arm.
COLUMBUS: ( jokingly ) Then I'm Governor of the Mosquitoes.
BROTHER BUYL: What kind of disease is this?
DOCTOR CHANCA: I don't know. It seems almost as if we have exchanged diseases with the Indians. They die of our most common cold, and we of their plague.
BROTHER BUYL: God forgive us!
DOCTOR: It seems to be caused by intimacy with the native women, Your Majesty.
ISABEL: Will he survive?
DOCTOR: No, Your Majesty. They go mad then they die. There is nothing we can do. ISABEL looks around at SANCHEZ, appalled.
SANCHEZ: Every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying. But with no gold! The new world proves expensive, Your We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we? We must have faith. We must give time for time. SANCHEZ bows in acknowledgement. But ISABEL, despite her words, looks distressed.
ISABEL: We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we? We must have faith. We must give time for time. SANCHEZ bows in acknowledgement. But ISABEL, despite her words, looks distressed.
TRANSLATOR: He says he has not found any!
MOXICA: He's lying! Again the INDIAN pleads and gesticulates. MOXICA hits him across the face with the thonged crop. The INDIAN tries to run away but is held by a SPANISH SOLDIER.
MOXICA: Bring him here! The frightened INDIAN is brought back to the table. One of the CLERKS slips away.
MOXICA: Tell him to put his hands on the table. Like this!
CLERK: Don Giacomo, you'd better come at EXT. MINE - DAY MOXICA turns, looks back at the long line of INDIANS, still passively waiting.
MOXICA: Tell them I want them to watch this! The terrified TRANSLATOR speaks to the INDIANS.
CLERK: Don't Moxica! You can't.
MOXICA: ( to the clerk ) I can't? I can't? With a single swift action, MOXICA draws his sword and cuts off the INDIAN'S hands. ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. The INDIANS flee, disappearing into the jungle. GIACOMO arrives at this moment. He stares at the dismembered hands in horror.
COLUMBUS: In one act of brutality, you have created chaos. Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us! All that because of your criminal savagery!
MOXICA: ( casually ) Savagery is what monkeys understand.
COLUMBUS: You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions. Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
MOXICA: ( with exquisite insolence ) You will regret this. He strolls to the GUARDS at the back of the room.
SOLDIER: ( without stopping ) You animals! Can't you wait! Discovering the FOUR TERRIFYING FIGURES staring at her, the INDIAN WOMAN starts screaming and pushes back the SOLDIER. He turns around, jumps off the WOMAN, and starts to scramble to the front door, trying to put on his THE FOUR INDIANS catch him, and force him to lay on the ground. THE MAN struggles, his eyes rolling in terror. TWO INDIANS force his mouth open. A THIRD ONE kneels and starts stuffing it with gold dust. THE SOLDIER chokes and THE WOMAN still stands half naked against the wall, terrified. AN INDIAN takes his knife from his leggings, slowly. She starts sobbing and imploring in her language. THE INDIAN slowly walks to her, and plants the knife in the lower part of her belly.
BARTOLOME: ( aggressively ) Moxica is right. Our ways don't BARTOLOME turns to UTAPAN.
BARTOLOME: ( aggressively ) Can you find them? UTAPAN looks distraught this is the first time he is being asked to do something against his own people. He looks up at COLUMBUS for help in confusion.
COLUMBUS: You have to find them, Utapan. Look what they did!
UTAPAN: You did the same to your God! COLUMBUS is caught short.
COLUMBUS: We have to stop this war. UTAPAN nods. He walks and takes an arrow. He examines Do you know them? UTAPAN nods, uncomfortable.
COLUMBUS: Do you know them? UTAPAN nods, uncomfortable.
COLUMBUS: Stop! Stop this!
GIACOMO: ( through cracked lips ) EXT. RIVER BANK - JUNGLE - DAWN COLUMBUS leads his party of SOLDIERS through the jungle, looking for the MUTINEERS. They reach the river scan the far bank. Nothing. COLUMBUS nods. His MEN start to enter the river, led by a
MOXICA: You know what they will say in Spain about my death don't you? He takes another step backwards, as COLUMBUS moves towards You are nothing! You bastards will never inherit your titles. We are everything. We are immortal! He smiles, and steps back into space.
MOXICA: You are nothing! You bastards will never inherit your titles. We are everything. We are immortal! He smiles, and steps back into space.
BROTHER BUYL: I wish to go back with them, Don Colon. I have no desire to remain in this godless place.
COLUMBUS: You may do as you please, Brother Buyl though your departure will not help me to make it more Godly. BROTHER BUYL looks at him, almost with astonishment.
BROTHER BUYL: You treat Christians equally with heathen savages. You execute members of the nobility. And what do you offer in return?
COLUMBUS: ( quietly ) A new world, Brother Buyl.
BROTHER BUYL: Nobody wants one.! Only you! And he walks away.
COLUMBUS: Perhaps hope only exists in the journey. When it begins, everything is still possible every expectation; every dream. The BROTHERS do not answer.
COLUMBUS: This is not how I imagined it to be.
COLUMBUS: UTAPAN is still and silent. A strange and mysterious figure now.
COLUMBUS: Utapan, won't you speak to me? You used to know how to speak to me.
UTAPAN: ( sadly, in his own language ) You never learned how to speak my UTAPAN is gone.
INDIANS: Urracan. Urracan. Urracan. With a loud thunderclap, the storm suddenly breaks. In a few seconds it has risen to violent proportions, and the landscape is drenched in torrential rain. The wind doubles its strength. and all hell breaks loose.
COLUMBUS: ( screaming ) Let it go! Let it go! The MEN scramble away as the dam wall buckles, and burst open. Water floods over them; a roaring torrent. From the bank, MENDEZ, BARTOLOME and COLUMBUS survey the ruins of their dreams.
SANCHEZ: . But there is worse. He ordered the execution of five members of the Is this true, Brother Buyl?
ISABEL: Is this true, Brother Buyl?
BROTHER BUYL: Yes, Your Majesty. It is all true. I saw it with my own eyes. A pause. ISABEL seems to struggle inwardly with her emotions. SANCHEZ waits, expressionless, but on the point of victory.
ISABEL: Then, what do you suggest, Don He must be replaced.
SANCHEZ: He must be replaced.
ISABEL: And who would you think of, for such a task?
BOBADILLA: Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
COLUMBUS: Yes. I remember. BOBADILLA turns, gestures to one of the other MEN, who comes forward and gives him a roll of parchment, bearing the royal seal.
BOBADILLA: My letters of appointment.
COLUMBUS: Appointment to what?
BOBADILLA: Viceroy of the West Indies.
COLUMBUS: Congratulations. Then I am free to search for the mainland. BOBADILLA smiles wickedly, happy to give COLUMBUS a low Didn't you learn? The mainland was discovered. Weeks ago. By another Italian. I forgot his name.
BOBADILLA: Didn't you learn? The mainland was discovered. Weeks ago. By another Italian. I forgot his name.
COLUMBUS: How far from here?
BOBADILLA: I am not a seaman. But I heard it is no more than a week at sea. I hope you are not too disappointed.
COLUMBUS: How could I be? The mainland has been found. Exactly as I said it I am afraid this is not the worst INT. CELL - SEVILLE PRISON - DAY All is dark. We can just make out COLUMBUS' face as he lies on the hard bed. He is sweating heavily; his beard is filthy and matted, like his hair. He looks feverish. A key turns in the lock. The JAILER lets in two fashionably dressed YOUNG MEN. COLUMBUS, blinking in the light, turns his head to stare at them. His eyes are reddened with infection at the corners. The YOUNG MEN come forward into the light.

FERNANDO: ( quietly ) Unable to believe it, COLUMBUS slowly sits up.
COLUMBUS: Fernando.! My God.! He laughs, overcome with joy. Embraces DIEGO.
COLUMBUS: A man! Diego, how did this happen?
DIEGO: Santangel is going to see the Queen. We are going to get you out of here.
COLUMBUS: Good! I have to go back! DIEGO and FERNANDO look at one another, then back at COLUMBUS, incredulously, seeing his filthy clothes, his eyes rimmed with dried mucus.
DIEGO: Go back? There's a new excitement in COLUMBUS' voice. He walks over to the table. The candlelight illuminates maps, charts, drawings, figures.
COLUMBUS: I have to explore the mainland.
FERNANDO: This time with me! COLUMBUS laughs and DIEGO looks at them both in In your present state it is madness, FERNANDO glances at DIEGO.
DIEGO: In your present state it is madness, FERNANDO glances at DIEGO.
FERNANDO: Nobody is forcing you to come with DIEGO is hurt.
DIEGO: I can't go anyway. A pause.
FERNANDO: She's very beautiful! The Queen has very good taste. Diego is getting DIEGO seems saddened by his brother's attitude. Once again DIEGO feels like the outsider. COLUMBUS hugs him.
COLUMBUS: I am happy for you, Diego.
SANTANGEL: Granted his faults. Yes, a hundred times! But the man is still ISABEL looks at him, then at SANCHEZ, MOVED BUT CLEARLY UNDECIDED. SANTANGEL presses his point.
SANTANGEL: All he asks is a chance to explore this. mainland.
SANCHEZ: It does not belong to him.
SANTANGEL: ( quietly ) In a way, it does, Don Sanchez. ( to the Queen ) I beg Your Majesty to receive him. To hear him. He will make no more demands. He has changed. He is Penitent.? He is suing us for breach of contract!
SANCHEZ: Penitent.? He is suing us for breach of contract!
ISABEL: Is he? She starts to laugh.
ISABEL: SANTANGEL tries to stop himself laughing.
ISABEL: Rise. Please. COLUMBUS gets slowly to his feet but his eyes, as they meet hers, are as clear as before. ISABEL smiles with relief to see it. He looks back at her.
COLUMBUS: Now I do look older than you. She smiles then again, tries to restrain it, and keeps her dignity.
ISABEL: We have decided to allow you to undertake another voyage to the new COLUMBUS starts to interrupt; she stops him with a But without your brothers. Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies. You may explore the continent.
ISABEL: But without your brothers. Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies. You may explore the continent.
COLUMBUS: Thank you.
ISABEL: There is one thing I'd like to understand. Why do you want to go back, after all this?
COLUMBUS: Your Majesty some men are content to read about things. I must see them with my own eyes. I cannot be other than I am. She almost bursts out laughing only pauses, turns slightly, then goes out.
ISABEL: I know, I should not tolerate his Then why?
SANCHEZ: Then why?
ISABEL: Because he is not afraid of me.
SANCHEZ: All I have to do is call the guards.
COLUMBUS: Call them. SANCHEZ looks at him and doesn't call. COLUMBUS lets go of him.
SANCHEZ: I am not afraid of you. You are nothing but a dreamer.
COLUMBUS: Look out of that window. Surprised, SANCHEZ nevertheless turns, looks out.
COLUMBUS: What do you see?
SANCHEZ: Roofs. towers, palaces. All of them created by people like SANCHEZ turns round again to face him.
COLUMBUS: All of them created by people like SANCHEZ turns round again to face him.
COLUMBUS: No matter how long you live, Sanchez, there's something that will never change between us. I did it! You didn't! COLUMBUS turns abruptly and walks away, vanishing down the echoing corridor.
COLUMBUS: God. you're so beautiful! I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me.
BEATRIX: They tried. but I didn't let them. She smiles. They don't dare to touch. BEATRIX looks round the empty room.
BEATRIX: They took everything.
COLUMBUS: ( looking at her ) Not everything. Do you think I care? I'm a free man again. Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier. They laugh. There's a pause.
COLUMBUS: God, how much I've missed you! And they throw themselves into each other's arms.
COLUMBUS: I owe you everything, Santangel. but as you see, I can't repay you.
SANTANGEL: On the contrary. It is I who owe you everything. Through you, I have been an adventurer, an explorer! It's true I shall never see the new world. but it's here. And here. COLUMBUS smiles. BEATRIX returns with a plate and glass for SANTANGEL.
SANTANGEL: What you are, Colon, is a sailor, a discoverer, a man of imagination. not a politician. You weren't meant to govern You cannot be all things to all men. He takes the wine BEATRIX offers, and raises his glass.
SANTANGEL: I wish you could have compromised. It would have made your life But as least we haven't been bored, have we? They all laugh, and drink.
COLUMBUS: But as least we haven't been bored, have we? They all laugh, and drink.
SAILOR'S VOICE: West. southwest, Captain Mendez.
COLUMBUS: How are you feeling, Fernando?
FERNANDO: ( in a strangled voice ) Not bad. COLUMBUS nods meditatively, puffs out some smoke. FERNANDO winces, gags slightly.
COLUMBUS: ( almost casually ) You know what I always used to do? FERNANDO shakes his head.
COLUMBUS: Swallow a piece of pork fat on a string. It always worked. At the thought of the pork fat, FERNANDO jerks his head over the side, and vomits copiously. COLUMBUS smiles, pats him on the back.
COLUMBUS: The mainland. FERNANDO looks excited. Discreetly, COLUMBUS watches his SON, enjoying his happiness.
MENDEZ: What's he doing?
COLUMBUS: He's drawing an isthmus. He's saying we're on an isthmus.
MENDEZ: We can't be. FERNANDO is still confused. The OLD INDIAN continues to sketch, talking quietly all the time. An INDIAN TRANSLATOR listens.
COLUMBUS: Tell me what he's saying.
TRANSLATOR: He says water on the other side.
COLUMBUS: Ask him if he means a lake. A big The TRANSLATOR asks. The OLD INDIAN shakes his head, laughs, points to the west, way beyond the other lakes, No. Says those are lakes. Water on other side big as wide as here. Above and below, much land.
TRANSLATOR: No. Says those are lakes. Water on other side big as wide as here. Above and below, much land.
COLUMBUS: ( stunned ) An ocean.? He's says it's an I don't understand. COLUMBUS is too stunned for a moment to explain. The INDIANS laugh. Then COLUMBUS takes the charcoal, and begins to draw on the map, for his son.
FERNANDO: I don't understand. COLUMBUS is too stunned for a moment to explain. The INDIANS laugh. Then COLUMBUS takes the charcoal, and begins to draw on the map, for his son.
COLUMBUS: Here is Europe. and over here, the continent of Asia. But there's something in between! Another continent! We've found. another FERNANDO stares west, then back at his FATHER. COLUMBUS looks very feverish, his face bathed with sweat.
FERNANDO: There must be a passage to that other ocean.
COLUMBUS: There must be a passage to that other ocean.
TRANSLATOR: I help. A little reluctantly, FERNANDO lets him go to his FATHER. The INDIAN crouches over the bed, takes out a handful of leaves from a pouch. He chews the leaves himself for a moment, until they form a sticky pulp, then opens COLUMBUS' mouth and puts the pulp inside, encouraging COLUMBUS to chew with the motions of his hands. COLUMBUS chews, quickly falling asleep.
FERNANDO: Oh my God. The remains of human beings.
COLUMBUS: ( approaching ) What is.? He stares at the remains, stunned. THE SOLDIER stops chewing. He drops the half-empty bowl he was still holding. He runs at the back door, rams his fingers deep in the back of his throat, and vomits.
SOLDIER: Oh Virgen Maria. Oh Madre de ( Oh Virgin Mary. Oh Mother of But as he vomits and cries, he notices: A HEADLESS HUMAN TRUNK spread open, like a sheep carcass. Disturbed flies rise in clouds.
SOLDIER: Jesus, Maria, y todos los Santos. ( Jesus, Mary, and all the Saints. )
COLUMBUS: ( urgently ) Out! Get out! THE SPANIARDS back out of the village, crossbows pointed at the invisible enemy hidden in the jungle. They are running through the dense forest for the river The CANNIBALS materialize among the trees, running alongside. Bounding, skipping, frightening FIGURES, their brutal faces painted in black. They release arrows at the running SOLDIERS. A SOLDIER stops, kneels to the ground, fires his crossbow and kills one of the CANNIBALS. but he is pierced by a spear. TWO CANNIBALS drag him and cut his throat to finish him.
COLUMBUS: ( kindly ) Take it. Come on. Drink. As COLUMBUS insists, brandishing the flask, FERNANDO notices that his hands are shaking too. His FATHER'S forehead is dripping with sweat. FERNANDO drinks a gulp and grimaces. He drinks again and hands the flask back to his FATHER, who does the same. FERNANDO notices dried blood on his FATHER'S fingers. COLUMBUS immediately hides his hand and stands.
COLUMBUS: I. I have to see Mendez. Then, with sudden anger.
COLUMBUS: Your brother was right. I should have never taken you with me. I'll never forgive myself. Never! He walks a few steps, lurches, and has to lean against the rail. He raises his hand to his eyes, grimacing in pain, as if they were burning. FERNANDO scrambles to his feet and rushes to him. COLUMBUS' eyes are already fixed somewhere fever is eating him up.
COLUMBUS: Will you ever forgive me? FERNANDO turns around for help.
COLUMBUS: Captain Mendez!
COLUMBUS: I came to Your Highness with honest purpose and sincere zeal. I did not undertake these voyages for honor or wealth that is certain. After years of service to the Crown, I do not have a roof to put over my head. Your Majesty allowed me to explore the continent, believed to be Asia. I now believe that it is an new Land, of unknown proportions and wealth. Life has more imagination than we carry in our INT. ALCAZAR PALACE - GARDENS - DAY The DUENA, sitting beside ISABEL, quietly continues to read COLUMBUS' letter aloud.
DUENA: "I should be judged as a Seaman who by Divine Will discovered a New World, and thereby placed it under the sovereignty of Your Majesties. I humbly beseech Your Majesties that if it pleases God to remove me hence, you will help the name of Columbus to be remembered with honor. Weep for me, whoever has charity, truth and justice." She stops reading. ISABEL turns her face away.
AROJAZ: . West by south west for 750 leagues to Santo Domingo. From there, west north west, leaving San Juan to the north, reaching the island of Hispanola on the northern cape of San Raphael. Then onto the mainland, at the Cape called Gracias a Dios. We continue to rise up the tiers of seats.
AROJAZ: Spain by Your Majesty's grace has confirmed for all humanity the existence of an unknown continent. Tierra Incognita. On a highest tier, we stop on the face of CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS, listening impassively.
AROJAZ: . This continent was first discovered by a sailor commissioned by your Majesty. CLOSE ON COLUMBUS' eyes.
AROJAZ: His name. Amerigo Vespucci. On COLUMBUS.
AROJAZ: My God.! I thought he was dead. They pass close enough to touch COLUMBUS. But he does not see them.
SANCHEZ: You can see for yourself.
AROJAZ: What a tragedy. what a waste of a A waste.? Let me tell you something, Arojaz. If your name, or mine, is ever remembered it will only be because of his. AROJAZ looks at SANCHEZ in surprise then cranes his neck round, and looks back at COLUMBUS now a FACE IN
SANCHEZ: A waste.? Let me tell you something, Arojaz. If your name, or mine, is ever remembered it will only be because of his. AROJAZ looks at SANCHEZ in surprise then cranes his neck round, and looks back at COLUMBUS now a FACE IN
MARCHENA: I suppose we're both old men now.
COLUMBUS: You'll always be older than me, They laugh. COLUMBUS sits down. Bees drone lazily in the Have you ever forgiven me? MARCHENA nods his head.
COLUMBUS: Have you ever forgiven me? MARCHENA nods his head.
MARCHENA: Yes. I forgave you a long time ago. You see, I was proud of you. You were like a willful child. You wouldn't accept what others told you. You had to find things out for yourself, hurting yourself and others in the process. MARCHENA looks at his plants, sighs contentedly.
MARCHENA: Do you remember when you said that people talk about the world, but never leave their gardens. COLUMBUS nods.
MARCHENA: More than ever I wonder what it is we do achieve by leaving our gardens. The world changes and yet it seems the same. We find new worlds, but fill them with the same He pauses, looks across at COLUMBUS, smiles again gently. MARCHENA, tiring, leans back in his chair, and looks up towards the sun.
COLUMBUS: I have to disagree.
MARCHENA: I knew you would.
COLUMBUS: New worlds create new people.
MARCHENA: Oh? So you are a new man?
COLUMBUS: I don't know. I have the impression that I didn't change that much. I still can't accept the world as it is! MARCHENA starts laughing.
MARCHENA: God bless you, and those like you! They both laugh.
COLUMBUS: Can't you stay with us a little?
BEATRIX: I am busy inside. He smiles. She looks at him smiling, intrigued.
BEATRIX: What is it, now? Tell me.
COLUMBUS: I can't keep my eyes off you. I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you. FERNANDO looks up at them above his letters, amused and slightly embarrassed. COLUMBUS looks at him with a fake air of reproach.
COLUMBUS: What are you listening to?
FERNANDO: I am not listening, Father. But I can't help hearing. FERNANDO opens a letter and reads it quickly.
FERNANDO: It's Diego. He is at the Court, with Santangel. He says they hope to get your privileges restored. And maybe the house. COLUMBUS smiles and nods all this seems to be of very little importance to him now.
COLUMBUS: But how is he? And Dona Maria? FERNANDO continues to read.
FERNANDO: Fine, it seems. Diego is thinking of starting a pearl trade, in Santo Domingo. He says he received many letters for you. Some of your men, He opens one of them, glances at it.
FERNANDO: This one is from Mendez! COLUMBUS' eyes brighten with joy.
COLUMBUS: What does he say?
FERNANDO: He asks when he can come to visit you. He left his address.
COLUMBUS: ( smiling ) He never had one. except aboard my FERNANDO laughs then, suddenly serious.
FERNANDO: I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father. From the beginning. Everything.
COLUMBUS: ( pause ) God. I wouldn't know where to start. and yet.
FERNANDO: Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind. COLUMBUS sighs, and leans back on his chair. His eyes are fixed somewhere, searching. Then, almost in a murmur.
COLUMBUS: I remember. We see the page. FERNANDO writes: . I REMEMBER. A drop of ink falls from the quill onto the page and the FERNANDO is waiting.
