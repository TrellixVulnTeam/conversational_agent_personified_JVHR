ELEVATOR: Ganz and Billy, guns ready as the carriage jolts downward. Rosalie is terrified, sobbing.
CATES: Arrives at the halfway turn of the second staircase. He takes the next flight in two jumps.
ELEVATOR: As the doors open, Ganz gestures for Billy and Rosalie to wait as he heads for the lobby.
LOBBY: Cates literally flies into the lobby just as Ganz appears. He slams Ganz against a column, belts him across the neck with his pistol. Ganz screams with pain, drops his gun. Cates again slams him with his pistol, felling him.
GANZ: Slides across the floor. CATES Senses something . moves just as Billy appears behind and fires at him. The bullet takes out a window. Cates dives over the desk. Another bullet chews up the wood.
LOBBY: Frizzy has been standing beside her desk, screaming. Cates' move and the accompanying bulletspanic her. She dashes for safety. Cates gets to his feet behind cover. Sees Billy holding Rosalie by the throat. Frizzy begins to scream.
GANZ: He'll blow her goddamn head off.

RUTH: ( continuing ) Lots of people getting shot with .44's lately . Last year, it was Saturday Night Specials..now it's heavy stuff. People must be getting madder about something.
POLICEWOMAN: You're an accessory to Murder One, so you're going to have to do a whole lot better than what we got down here, honey.
LISA: Gimme a break, huh? . Look, I got there. He was a trick just like any other for all I knew. That's all there is. He didn't feel like sitting and talking. He was in a big hurry to get laid. I was with him about an hour. We got a print from the hotel room. Guy's real name is Ganz, Albert Ganz. A hitter from back East but he worked out here a few years back. Armed robbery. Broke out of prison two days ago and capped two of the guards. A real animal. Wait'll you see this.

CATES: Cates looks up as he hears that remark. Notices KEHOE, another Detective, entering with a long suitcase.
POLICEWOMAN: What makes you think so?
LISA: I think he liked shooting cops a lot more than getting laid.
CATES: Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
KEHOE: Every last bit of it. The big guy's room was empty.
CATES: I'll help you out.
KEHOE: This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.

HADEN: Yeah, I read the report.
CATES: Hey, the bastard's got my gun. I want it back.
HADEN: Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian. In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business. I know, we all know the truth's a little
CATES: Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
HADEN: Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
CATES: Yeah. It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
HADEN: You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
CATES: Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far. Besides, I got a lead.
HADEN: Okay. You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine. Nail this guy and make us all look good. But you better watch your ass. If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.

HADEN: Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.

CITY STREET: Heavy vehicle and pedestrian traffic. Cates stands near a hot dog stand. Elaine joins him. Cates is eating a hot dog and studying a police file.
ELAINE: Great place for lunch.
CATES: Yeah, one of my favorites.
ELAINE: You made the front page.
CATES: Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day.
ELAINE: Jack, are you okay?
CATES: Sure, okay, fine, no problem. See, there's this kid in jail . First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows .
ELAINE: I thought you might come over to my place to recuperate. I don't have to go to work until the day after tomorrow.
CATES: I got nothing to recuperate from. There's a guy out there with my gun, and I want it back.
ELAINE: Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun.
CATES: Bullshit? I'll tell you about bullshit. My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it. It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is .
ELAINE: Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop. It's not a practical way to function.
CATES: I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility. I like to get the job done right. And if I don't get my job done right. I'm for shit.
ELAINE: Here it comes again . the sacred That's right. I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong.

I don't like it. No one asked you to like it. But that's the way it is.

GUARD: Open Nine.
GUARD: Close Nine.
GUARD: ( continuing ) It's Number Twenty-two. You want No, no thanks.
CATES: No, no thanks.
CATES: He walks down the cell block. Inmates stare at him from inside the stark cells. They don't know who he is, but they can smell a cop. Cates stops at Twenty-two, looks inside. a bit startled. Obviously, Reggie Hammond has connections and taste. The paint is fresh; there's framed prints on the wall instead of pin-ups, and the overall feeling is that of a graduate school dorm rather than a prison. Cates turns, nods to the Guard at the end of the cell block. He throws a switch and the door opens.
HAMMOND'S CELL: Cates steps inside. Hammond is at a table wearing a Sony Walkman and writing in some detailed ledgers with a fountain pen. He's boogeying in his seat to the music. Sprawled on a bunk nearby is LEROY, another black inmate close to Hammond's age. Leroy is leafing through a copy of a skin magazine. He doesn't even look at Cates.
CATES: Cates steps inside the cell.
CATES: ( continuing ) ( continuing )
CATES: ( continuing )
HAMMOND: You got a name, cop?
CATES: Try Cates. And let's talk in private, okay?
HAMMOND: Sure, anything you want.
CATES: Look, convict, I know all about you. Single. No fixed address. No known relatives. One previous conviction. Armed robbery. six months to go on a three-year sentence.
HAMMOND: You here to write my life story?

HAMMOND: You wanna leave, man? Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
CATES: You? Don't make me laugh. You can't take care of shit. You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt. All you're good for is games.

CATES: Just tell me about the money.
HAMMOND: Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. . Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.

CATES: You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.
HAMMOND: I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
CATES: THE CITY Beyond the skyline, grey streaks of dawn etch the sky.
THE CITY: Beyond the skyline, grey streaks of dawn etch the sky.
CADILLAC: Hammond stretches on the back seat. Cates slams the door Hammond yawns, eases himself into a sitting position.
CATES: I don't want you sleeping on the
HAMMOND: The place opens in five minutes. Ganz ought to be here soon.
CATES: You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.
HAMMOND: Not really. I figured Ganz was put down for a long time. And I knew Luther would never job me on his own. He's too chickenshit.
CATES: Guess what? Luther just got in
HAMMOND: Musta got some primo bondsman.
CATES: Musta got some primo bondsman.
HAMMOND: Jesus Christ. That's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in 24 hours. I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door.
ATTENDANT: I want to pick up my car.
LUTHER: I want to pick up my car.
ATTENDANT: The Attendant examines the form, surprised.
LUTHER: The Attendant examines the form, surprised.
ATTENDANT: This is three years old.
LUTHER: Yeah, I've been busy.
ATTENDANT: We don't wash 'em, ya know.
LUTHER: How about chargin' the battery?
ATTENDANT: That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
LUTHER: Great, just great.
STREET: Luther drives down the exit ramp in a dated Porsche The car is covered with a uniform coat of dust, except for the windshield which has been wiped hastily clean. Luther waits for a break in the flow of traffic, drives out. Another street Luther turns onto a side street and then suddenly Cate's Cadillac appears . starts to tail the Porsche.
CADILLAC: Cates follows Luther through several turns. The Porsche jerks whenever it speeds up or slows down.
HAMMOND: Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car.why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?
CATES: Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
HAMMOND: I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac.
ANOTHER STREET: The Caddy follows the Porsche.
CATES: You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
HAMMOND: Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
CATES: If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd just leave town.
HAMMOND: I'm tellin' you the man's in love. he wants to be a hero for his girl.
CATES: Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?
ANOTHER STREET: The Caddy follows the Porsche. As they follow Luther.
CATES: I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to I let women get to me. The quest for pussy is the meaning of life . I got my own personal philosophy about 'em. Keep women separate from guns, money and business . women are for spending money. They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
HAMMOND: I let women get to me. The quest for pussy is the meaning of life . I got my own personal philosophy about 'em. Keep women separate from guns, money and business . women are for spending money. They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
CATES: That ain't philosophy. That's common sense.
ANOTHER STREET: The Caddy follows the Porsche.
HAMMOND: Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
CATES: If they don't tell me what I need to know.
HAMMOND: Doesn't it get. Tiring?
CATES: I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either. I do it 'cause it works-.
HAMMOND: You got a very depressing view of life, man. you gotta smile once in awhile.
ANOTHER STREET: The Caddy follows the Porsche.
CATES: Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money.
HAMMOND: If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.
ANOTHER STREET: The Caddy follows the Porsche.
HAMMOND: A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain . that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row.
CATES: Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough
ANOTHER STREET: The Caddy follows the Porsche.
HAMMOND: You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.
CATES: What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
HAMMOND: No class.
CATES: Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a
ANOTHER STREET: The Caddy follows the Porsche.
HAMMOND: We're getting too close . Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
CATES: Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb. But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make
ANOTHER STREET: Luther pulls over to curb and parks.
CADILLAC: suddenly swings over several lanes of traffic and parks in driveway of parking lot.
CATES: That Goddamn suit is yours?
HAMMOND: That was in style a couple years back, man.
CATES: Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.
CADILLAC: That's the money, Jack.
HAMMOND: That's the money, Jack.
STREET: Luther hurries along the sidewalk. He reaches the corner, turns quickly.
PATROLMAN: Ganz whirls, his feet slipping on the marble floor. His shot at Hammond goes plowing into the ceiling. The crowd starts to panic and run in all directions. The Patrolman has al ready brought his own gun out. Levels it at Ganz.
PATROLMAN: ( continuing ) Put it down.
BILLY BEAR: Suddenly appears, Rosalie at his side. Billy Bear's .44 blasts the Patrolman onto his back. Ganz comes up and scrambles through the screaming patrons. He, Billy and Rosalie head toward the escalator. Cates has already brought out his .38. Can't get a clean shot through the chaos. Hammond pushes his way through the crowd to Cates.
HAMMOND: Shoot the sons of bitches.
HAMMOND: ( continuing ) You don't want to chance it, then give me the gun.
HAMMOND: ( continuing ) Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
CATES: You stay with me.
HAMMOND: No way.
PASSENGER WALKWAY: Panic has overtaken everyone as they try to escape the madman with the gun. Ganz and Billy elbow and kick their way through the crowd, tugging Rosalie along. Cates, gun in hand, creates further-panic as he moves after Ganz grabs a man beside him. Shoves him hard into the passengers in back. The man knocks over several more people creating a roadblock. Ganz vaults over the railing and starts for the trains. Cates loses a few more precious seconds grappling through the terrorized passengers.
TRAIN AREA: The usually jammed area looks like an empty stockyard. The patrons huddle in fear against any available wall. Cates bursts out of the stairwell.
TUNNEL: Red and green signal lights. The light goes red, a train roars up and the doors hiss open. Billy and Ganz fight through the passengers getting off the train, jump on board; Billy pulls Rosalie behind him.
CATES: Running for the doors. Suddenly, a SECURITY OFFICER appears, riot gun in hand.
SECURITY OFFICER: No! No! There they are!
CATES: No! No! There they are!
SECURITY OFFICER: Just put it down real slow.
CATES: I'm a policeman, you asshole!
SECURITY OFFICER: Don't even try. now drop it or - you're all done.
CATES: TRAIN STATION - LOBBY Witnesses stand in nervous little knots. Give versions of what happened to notepad-toting patrolmen. Hospital Attendants minister to various and sundry complaints. Cates sits on a passenger bench, obviously dejected. A voice comes echoing from behind.
HADEN: Haden, silhouetted against the light from the street.
HADEN: ( continuing ) What the bell happened?
CATES: I lost them, that's what happened.

HADEN: Which one pulled the trigger?
CATES: The Indian. I was about 30 yards You couldn't get to him?
HADEN: You couldn't get to him?
HADEN: ( continuing ) What a screw-up.
CATES: Right. I screwed up. I fucked up. I messed up. Anybody could have done better, especially you. I bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds.
HADEN: Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand I didn't have the time.
CATES: I didn't have the time.
HADEN: Too bad, it would've covered your ass. Now you're in the shit and so's the department. In case you haven't noticed, this wasn't our finest hour. I told you everyone was watchin' on this one. Maybe you better start thinkin' about writin' tickets off a three wheel
HAMMOND: Punk Dancers all over the floor. A rock group blasting away.( "NEW SHOES" - Vocal )

HAMMOND: Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you.

HADEN: ( continuing ) That's rights I called him a nigger. You bet I did . I saw the report on that little piece of shit. If he spent one legal day in his whole life, it'd be a record.This is it for you. suspension, review board. you've had it. When it gets 'round you protect a con rather than nail a cop killer.
CATES: He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.

CATES: How do you know?
ELAINE: Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type. But this
HAMMOND: He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend. He was loyal, went all the way for you.
ELAINE: In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me. The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend. Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
CATES: Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend. I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet . They both looked mad enough to kill Yeah, too bad. They were real nice lookin' too.In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV.
HAMMOND: Yeah, too bad. They were real nice lookin' too.In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV.
ELAINE: What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
CATES: Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
ELAINE: It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions. I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian . Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
CATES: So what?
ELAINE: When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.

CATES: Let's go, Reggie.
HAMMOND: Do I get to kiss her too?
CATES: If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
HAMMOND: What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit? I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.
CATES: I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it. Hey, there she is.
HAMMOND: Hey, there she is.
CATES: Whatever play I maker just back me If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
HAMMOND: If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
CATES: Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine. You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps.
HAMMOND: Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart. I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
