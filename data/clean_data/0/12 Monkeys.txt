TWELVE MONKEYS: An original screenplay by David Peoples
P.A. SYSTEM: Flight 784 for San Francisco is now ready for boarding at inmate number 66578, Greely.
COLE: Ssssst! Jose, what's going on? JOSE's face is almost lost in shadow. What there is of it is youthful. He's just a scared Puerto Rican kid!
JOSE: "Volunteers" again. JOSE immediately rolls over and feigns sleep as SCARFACE, a menacing guard with a jagged scar running down his cheek, looms close to COLE's cage and unlocks it.
SCARFACE: "Volunteer duty".
COLE: I didn't volunteer.
SCARFACE: You causing trouble again?
COLE: ( controls his temper ) No trouble.
TTTLES END: INT. FIRST UNDERGROUND DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT ROARING WATER, powerful torrents gushing from nozzles in the wall, pummel the still-suited COLE.
TINY: James Cole. Cleared from quarantine.
MICROBIOLOGIST: Thank you. You two wait outside.
SCARFACE: He's got a history, Doctor. Violence. COLE'S eyes return to the walls. Headlines: "CLOCK TICKING! NO CURE YET!"
SCARFACE: Anti-social six doing 25 to life.
ENGINEER: I don't think he's going to hurt us. You're not going to hurt us, are you Mr. Cole? COLE'S head turns quickly to the ENGINEER.
COLE: No, sir. The GUARDS exchange a look, shrug, exit, closing the door.
MICROBIOLOGIST: Why don't you sit down, Mr. Cole. COLE goes to the empty chair at the conference table, sits down.
ASTROPHYSICIST: We want you to tell us about last I went to the surface and I collected specimens like I was told. The SCIENTISTS don't say anything. They just study him carefully.
COLE: I went to the surface and I collected specimens like I was told. The SCIENTISTS don't say anything. They just study him carefully.
COLE: ( worried ) I mashed the spider, didn't I?
MICROBIOLOGIST: We'll get to the spider later, Mr. Cole. Right now, we want to know everything that you saw.
ASTPOPHYSICIST: Where you collected sample #4, what street was that?
COLE: It's important to observe everything.
BOTANIST: It's important to observe everything.
COLE: I think it was.I'm sure it was 2nd Street. As the SCIENTISTS start to whisper animatedly among themselves, COLE'S eyes drift across the newspaper clippings taped to the wall. One headline screams, "VIRUS MUTATING!" Another features a photo of an OLD MAN ( DR. MASON, who we'll see again later on ) and the words, SCIENTIST SAYS, "IT'S TOO LATE FOR CURE". Close your eyes, Cole. Startled, COLE closes his eyes obediently. BLACKNESS. Like COLE, WE SEE NOTHING. But we HEAR their VOICES. Tell us in detail what you've seen in this room. Uh, in this room? Uh. How many of us are there? Six.seven, if you count me. Tell us about the pictures on the wall. Uh, you mean the newspapers? Tell us about the newspapers. Can you hear my voice? What do I look like? What does he look like, the man who just spoke? How old were you when you left the surface? The VOICES blur into a cacophony and FADE INTO the droning P.A. SYSTEM at the airport.
MR. PONYTAIL: WATCH IT! YOUNG COLE sees little more than the gaudy pants, the duffle, and the man's ponytail flopping as he rushes towards the gates. Just then, a WOMAN'S VOICE cries out, "NOOOOOOOOO!" YOUNG COLE turns back toward the Security Check Point just as TRAVELERS scatter madly, some diving to the floor, others running. A TERRIFIED TRAVELER, hitting the floor close by, looks up at YOUNG COLE with panicky eyes, and asks..
WATCH IT!: YOUNG COLE sees little more than the gaudy pants, the duffle, and the man's ponytail flopping as he rushes towards the gates. Just then, a WOMAN'S VOICE cries out, "NOOOOOOOOO!" YOUNG COLE turns back toward the Security Check Point just as TRAVELERS scatter madly, some diving to the floor, others running. A TERRIFIED TRAVELER, hitting the floor close by, looks up at YOUNG COLE with panicky eyes, and asks..
TERRIFIED TRAVELER: Just exactly why did you volunteer?
ASTROPHYSICIST: Wake up, Cole.
COLE: Uh, I didn't hear the.
MICROBIOLOGIST: ( tapping a pencil on the table ) I asked you, why did you volunteer?
COLE: Well, the guard woke me up. He told me I volunteered. The SCIENTISTS react, whispering urgently among themselves. COLE starts to nod off again, then comes awake with a start as the ENGINEER speaks to him.
ENGINEER: We appreciate you volunteering. You're a very good observer, Cole.
COLE: Uh, thank you.
ENGINEER: You'll get a reduction in sentence. COLE keeps his face impassive.
ASTROPHYSICIST: To be determined by the proper authorities.
ENGINEER: You don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, Cole? Have it taken away?
COLE: No, sir!
ASTROPHYSICIST: We have a very advanced program, something very different, requires very skilled people.
MICROBIOLOGIST: An opportunity to reduce your sentence And possibly play an important role in returning the human race to the surface of the earth.
ZOOLOGIST: And possibly play an important role in returning the human race to the surface of the earth.
ENGINEER: We want tough minded people. Strong mentally. We've had some.misfortunes with "unstable" types.
ASTROPHYSICIST: For a man in your position.an opportunity.
BOTANIST: Not to volunteer could be a real mistake.
MICROBIOLOGIST: ( tapping his pencil again ) Definitely a mistake! COLE gives away nothing. He's in a box here. He has no choices. He stares at the tapping pencil.
POET: Still among the myriad microwaves, the infra-red messages, the gigabytes of ones and zeroes, we find words, infinitesimally small, byte-sized now, tinier even than science lurking in some vague electricity where, if we listen we can hear the solitary voice of that poet telling us, "We are no other than a moving row Of Magic shadow-shapes that come and go Round with the Sun-illumined Lantern hold In Midnight by the Master of the show." As the POET reads, we STUDY the audience, mostly YUPPIE CULTURE JUNKIES or BOHEMIANS. Among them, a light-haired woman of twenty- eight, soberly dressed, wearing glasses. She's KATHRYN RAILLY. And it's her beeper that suddenly BEEPS. BEEP! BEEP! "The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ, Moves on: nor all your Piety nor Wit Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line, Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it." BEEP! BEEP! Scowling at the outrageous interruption, the POET looks up from the text just as RAILLY, tumbling, shuts off the beeper and rises, embarrassed. As she makes her way to an exit, the glaring POET continues.
POET: "Yesterday This Day's Madness did prepare; Tomorrow's Silence, Triumph or Despair: Drink! for you know not whence you came, nor why: Drink! for you know not why you go, nor where."
FRANKI: so they get there and they ask the guy real nice for some kind of i.d., and he gets agitated, starts screaming about viruses. Totally irrational, totally disoriented, doesn't know where he is, what day it is, alla that stuff. All they got was his name. They figure he's stoned out of his mind, it's some kinda psychotic episode, so they're gonna bring him.
RAILLY: He's been tested for drugs?
FRANKI: Negative for drugs. But he took on five cops like he was dusted to the eyeballs. No drugs. You believe that? FRANKI pauses, indicating a tiny observation window of thick meshed glass in an otherwise solid door, and RAILLY looks through it. RAILLY'S POV THROUGH THE WINDOW: a MAN, his back to her, in strait-jacket and prison denims, examining the wall of the padded cell with the distorted intensity of a "mental case".
RAILLY: You have him in restraints.
FRANKI: Were you listening? We got two officers in the hospital. Yeah, he's in restraints, plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse. Look at him! Still on his feet. RAILLY'S POV THROUGH THE WINDOW: the MAN in the cell turns, looks right at her. In spite of the cuts and welts, it's clearly COLE.
RAILLY: That would explain the bruises, I guess. The struggle.
FRANKI: You want to go in? Examine him?
RAILLY: Yes, please. You said he gave a name.
FRANKI: ( unlocking the door ) James Cole. That's everything we got. None of the James Coles on the computer match him. No license, no prints, no warrants. Nothing. You want me to go in with you?
RAILLY: ( entering ) No, thank you.
FRANKI: I'll be right here.just in case.
RAILLY: Mr. Cole? My name is Doctor Railly. I'm a psychiatrist. I work for the County I don't work for the police. My only concern is your well being do you understand that?
COLE: I need to go now.
RAILLY: I'm going to be completely honest. I'm not going to lie to you. I can't make the police let you go.but I do want to help you. And I want you to trust me. Can you do that, James? May I call you "James"?
COLE: "James"! Nobody ever calls me that.
RAILLY: ( frowns, studies him ) Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
COLE: No, not possible. Listen, I have to get out of here. I'm supposed to be getting information.
RAILLY: What kind of information?
COLE: It won't help you. You can't do anything about it. You can't change anything.
RAILLY: Change what?
COLE: I need to go.
RAILLY: Do you know why you're here, James.
COLE: Because I'm a good observer. Because I have a tough mind.
RAILLY: I see. You don't remember assaulting a police officer.several officers?
COLE: They wanted identification. I don't have any identification. I wasn't trying to hurt them.
RAILLY: You don't have a driver's license, James? Or a Social Security card?
COLE: Why not? Most people have some ID.
RAILLY: Why not? Most people have some ID.
COLE: You wouldn't understand.
RAILLY: You've been in an institution, haven't you, James? A hospital?
COLE: I have to go.
RAILLY: A jail? Prison?
COLE: I love this air. This is wonderful air.
RAILLY: I love this air. This is wonderful air.
COLE: I love this air. This is wonderful air.
RAILLY: What's wonderful about the air, James?
COLE: It's so clean. No germs.
RAILLY: You're afraid of germs?
COLE: I have to go.
RAILLY: Why do you think there aren't any germs in the air, James?
COLE: This is April, right?
RAILLY: ( sudden panic ) Do you know what year it is?
COLE: ( sudden panic ) Do you know what year it is?
RAILLY: Do you know what year it is?
COLE: What year is it?
RAILLY: What year do you think it is?
COLE: You think it's July of 1995? That's the future, James. Do you think you're living in the future?
RAILLY: You think it's July of 1995? That's the future, James. Do you think you're living in the future?
COLE: ( slightly confused ) No, 1995 is the past.
RAILLY: 1995 is the future, James. This is 1989. COLE looks stunned.
COLE: Where are you taking me?
POLICEMAN #1: South of France, buddy. Fancy hotel. You're gonna love it.
COLE: South of France?! I don't want to go to the South of France. I want to make a telephone call. POLICEMAN #2 smirks as he unlocks a heavy steel door.
POLICEMAN #2: Zip it, scumbag you fooled the shrink with your act, but you don't fool us. Then, POLICEMAN #2 swings the steel door open and sunlight overwhelms COLE, blinding him in a dazzling fury of white light.
BILLINGS: Lemme see your head, Jimbo, see if you got any creepy crawlies.
COLE: I need to make a telephone call.
BILLINGS: ( pulling Cole's head ) Gotta work that out with a doctor, Jimbo. Can't make no calls 'til the doctor says.
COLE: It's very important.
BILLINGS: What chew gotta do, Jimbo, is take it easy, relax into things. We all gonna get along fine if you just relax. COLE gets the hint of menace in the message and submits to the lice inspection, only his eyes revealing his frustration.
BILLINGS: Jeffrey. Yo! Jeffrey. This here is James. Whyncha show James around? Tell him the TV rules, show him the games an' stuff, okay?
JEFFREY: ( with a sly look ) How much you gonna pay me? Huh? I'd be doing your job.
BILLINGS: Five thousand dollars, my man. That enough? I'll wire it to your account as usual, okay?
JEFFREY: Okay, Billings. Five thousand. That's enough. Five thousand dollars. I'll give him the Deluxe Mental Hospital Tour. As BILLINGS walks away chuckling, JEFFREY turns to COLE.
JEFFREY: Kid around, kid around. It makes them feel good, we're all pals. We're prisoners, they're the guards, but it's all in good fun, you see? COLE nods and JEFFREY indicates card tables where PATIENTS are playing cards, checkers, chess, or working on jig saw puzzles.
JEFFREY: Here's the games. Games vegitize you. If you play the games, you're voluntarily taking a tranquilizer. COLE sees a partially completed puzzle of the well-known painting, THE PEACEABLE KINGDOM, depicting a serene world of animals in harmony.
JEFFREY: What'd they give you? Thorazine? How much? Learn your drugs know your doses.
COLE: I need to make a telephone call.
JEFFREY: A telephone call? That's communication with the outside world! Doctor's discretion. Hey, if alla these nuts could just make phone calls, it could spread. Insanity oozing through telephone cables, oozing into the ears of all those poor sane people, infecting them! Whackos everywhere! A plague of madness. In fact, very few of us here are actually mentally ill. I'm not saying you're not mentally ill, for all I know you're crazy as a loon. But that's not why you're here. Why you're here is because of the system, because of the economy. There's the TV. It's all right there. Commercials. We are not productive anymore, they don't need us to make things anymore, it's all automated. What are we for then? We're consumers. Okay, buy a lot of stuff, you're a good citizen. But if you don't buy a lot of stuff, you know what? You're mentally ill! That's a fact! If you don't buy things.toilet paper, new cars, computerized blenders, electrically operated sexual devices.
TERRY: Take it easy, Jeffrey. Be calm. Abruptly, JEFFREY stifles his hysteria, takes a deep breath and continues, completely calm now. But COLE isn't listening. He's mesmerized by the TV.
JEFFREY: So if you want to watch a particular program, say "All My Children" or something, you go to the Charge Nurse and tell her what day and time the show you want to see is on. But you have to tell her before the show is scheduled to be on. There was this one guy who was always requesting shows that had already played. He couldn't quite grasp the idea that the Charge Nurse couldn't just make it be yesterday for him, turn back time ha ha. What a fruitcake!! This last thought actually penetrates COLE'S focus on the TV and he turns to JEFFREY who's picking up speed again.
JEFFREY: Seriously, more and more people are being defined now as mentally ill. Why? Because they're not consuming on their own. But as patients, they becone consumers of mental health care. And this gives the so-called sane people work!
TERRY: Okay, that's it, Jeffrey, you're gonna get a shot. I warned you.
JEFFREY: ( calming himself, smiling ) Right! Right! Carried away, heh heh. I got "carried away". Explaining the workings of.the institution. Just then, TJ WASHINGTON, a somber-looking African American in a bathrobe, taps COLE on the shoulder.
TJ WASHINGTON: I don't really come from outer space.
JEFFREY: This is TJ Washington, Jim he doesn't really come from outer space.
TJ WASHINGTON: Don't mock me, my friend. It's a condition of "mental divergence". I find myself on another planet, Ogo, part of an intellectual elite, preparing to subjugate barbarian hordes on Pluto. But even though it's a totally convincing reality in every way.I can feel, breathe, hear.nevertheless, Ogo is actually a construct of my psyche. I am mentally divergent in that I am escaping certain unnamed realities that plague my life here. When I stop going there, I will be well. Are you also divergent, friend? The P.A. SYSTEM interrupts, startling COLE. James Cole. Report to Staff. James Cole!
JEFFREY: Staff! Whoo! Time for Staff. Now the geniuses cure you. Hallelujah!
COLE: This is a place for crazy people! I'm not crazy! RAILLY, four other PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENTS, including RAILLY'S best friend, MARILOU MARTIN, and their chief, DR. OWEN FLETCHER, sit around a beat-up conference table, watching COLE, who sits facing the doctors, with BILLINGS looming behind him. ( Some of the DOCTORS bear a strong resemblance to the SCIENTISTS OF THE FUTURE. )
RESIDENT #1: We don't use that term."crazy", Mr. Cole.
COLE: Well, you've got some real nuts in here! Listen to me, all of you I have to tell you something that's going to be difficult for you to understand, but.
DR. RAILLY: James.please. These are all doctors here and we want to help you.
DR. FLETCHER: Mr. Cole last night you told Dr. Railly you thought it was. 1995. . How about right now? Do you know what year it is right now?
COLE: 1989. Look, I'm not confused. There's been a mistake, I've been sent to the wrong place. Suddenly, COLE reaches out and BILLINGS lunges forward, but COLE is just grabbing a pad and pencil.
COLE: Hey, I'm not going to hurt anybody. FLETCHER restrains BILLINGS with a hand signal.
COLE: ( drawing ) Do any of you know anything about the Army of the Twelve Monkeys? They paint this, stencil it, on buildings, all over the place. COLE waves a sketch of the dancing monkey logo we saw earlier.
DR. CASEY: Mr. Cole.
COLE: Right. I guess you wouldn't, this is 1989, they're probably not active yet. That makes sense! Okay. Listen to me, three billion people died in 1995. Three billion, got that? Almost the whole population. Of the world! Only about one percent survived. DOCTORS exchange knowing looks. This is an old story, apparently.
RESIDENT #2: Are you going to save us, Mr. Cole?
COLE: Save you? How can I save you? It already happened! I can't save you. I'm simply trying to get some information for people in the present so that someday. You don't believe me. You think I'm crazy. But I'm not crazy. I'm a convict, sure, I have a quick temper, but I'm as sane as anyone in this room. I. COLE stops, sees DR. FLETCHER tapping his pencil. COLE'S seen that tapping before in the future! It disorients him.
DR. RAILLY: Can you tell us the name of the prison you've come from? COLE doesn't answer. He's staring at the tapping pencil.
DR. FLETCHER: Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?
COLE: ( recovering, new tack ) No! Look, I don't belong here! What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.
DR. FLETCHER: Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out?
COLE: Scientists. I'm supposed to report in to them. They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.
DR. FLETCHER: So you could talk to these scientists and they do what? Send you to the future?
COLE: No, no. I can't talk to them. It's called, "voice mail". I'm supposed to leave messages. They monitor it from the present.
RESIDENT #2: "From the present." We're not in the present now, Mr. Cole?
COLE: No, no. This is the past. This has already happened. Listen.
RESIDENT #3: Mr. Cole, you belong in 1995 that's the present, is that it?
COLE: No, 1995 is the past, too. Look.
DR. FLETCHER: These scientists, Mr. Cole? Are they doctors like ourselves? Two of the residents exchange quick knowing looks.
COLE: No! I mean yes, but. Look, I've been given a lot of drugs but I'm still perfectly lucid. You have to let me use the phone. One call! COLE looks desperately toward RAILLY, pleading eyes meeting hers.
MOTHER: ( listens, frowns, then ) Whaaaaat? "Voice mail"! I don't know what you're talkin' about. . Is this a joke? I don't know any scientists. James who? Never heard of you! The MOTHER slams down the phone.
RAILLY: It wasn't who you expected? COLE is clearly agitated, starts to pace, upset. Nuts?
COLE: It was some lady. She didn't know anything.
RAILLY: Perhaps it was a wrong number.
COLE: No. That's the reason they chose me I remember things. RAILLY frowns, studying the distracted man with intense interest. It's clear COLE is becoming a special patient and RAILLY'S cool, detached demeanor is giving way ever so slightly.
RAILLY: James, where did you grow up? Was it around here? Around Baltimore?
COLE: ( lost in thought ) I have the.strangest feeling I've met you before.a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever.?
RAILLY: I have the.strangest feeling I've met you before.a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever.?
COLE: Wait! This is only 1989! I'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995. It's not the right number yet. That's the problem. Damn! How can I contact them? RAILLY recovers her distance, her poise, as she takes a bottle, pours out some tablets, and holds them out to COLE.
RAILLY: James, take these. Please I helped you like I said I would. Now I want you to trust me.
MR. PONYTAIL: WATCH IT! Was it JEFFREY wearing gaudy pants and a ponytail? It was definitely JEFFREY'S VOICE. TRAVELERS dive for cover as a WOMAN'S VOICE cries out.
WATCH IT!: Was it JEFFREY wearing gaudy pants and a ponytail? It was definitely JEFFREY'S VOICE. TRAVELERS dive for cover as a WOMAN'S VOICE cries out.
WOMAN'S VOICE: The TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks up at YOUNG COLE, makes eye contact, but doesn't speak. The TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks a lot like DR. FLETCHER! Just then, YOUNG COLE is distracted by a running figure. It's the BLONDE MAN in the Hawaiian shirt, but he's not injured. He's sprinting toward the gates, glancing back over his shoulder, his moustache slightly askew! A sharp CRACK of a GUNSHOT rings out! Then, DAZZLING LIGHT. Everything goes white!
NOOOOOOOOOO!: The TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks up at YOUNG COLE, makes eye contact, but doesn't speak. The TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks a lot like DR. FLETCHER! Just then, YOUNG COLE is distracted by a running figure. It's the BLONDE MAN in the Hawaiian shirt, but he's not injured. He's sprinting toward the gates, glancing back over his shoulder, his moustache slightly askew! A sharp CRACK of a GUNSHOT rings out! Then, DAZZLING LIGHT. Everything goes white!
JEFFREY: You think you can remove the grill but you can't. It's welded. COLE checks the grill anyway.
JEFFREY: See? I toldja. And all the doors are locked, too. They're protecting the people on the outside from us. But the people outside are as crazy as us. COLE has become preoccupied with a small SPIDER creeping along the window sill. He's staring at it when he's distracted by a sudden SOUND. Grabbing the SPIDER, COLE scrambles back into bed just as the door opens and an ORDERLY probes the dark room with the blade of his flashlight. ANGLE ON COLE, in bed, feigning sleep. The flashlight clicks off and COLE hears the door close. For a long moment the ward is silent except for BREATHING, SNORES, occasional MOANS. Then, COLE hears JEFFREY'S hoarse whisper, picking up right where he left off.
JEFFREY: You know what "crazy" is? "crazy" is "majority rules". Take germs for example. Although COLE is preoccupied with the SPIDER struggling to get out of his fist, he can't help reacting to the word, "germs"!
COLE: In the 18th century there was no such thing! Nobody'd ever imagined such a thing no sane person anyway. Along comes this doctor.Semmelweiss, I think. He tries to convince people. other doctors mostly.that there are these teeny tiny invisible "bad things" called germs that get into your body and make you.sick! He's trying to get doctors to wash their hands. What is this guy.crazy? Teeny tiny invisible whaddayou call 'em?."germs"! As JEFFREY warms to his subject, getting excited, COLE tries to figure out where to put the SPIDER. So cut to the 20th century! Last week in fact, right before I got dragged into this hellhole. I order a burger in this fast food joint. The waiter drops it on the floor. He picks it up, wipes it off, hands it to me.like it was all okay. No alternative. COLE pops the SPIDER in his mouth and swallows it as JEFFREY prattles on.

COLE pops the SPIDER in his mouth and swallows it as JEFFREY prattles on.
JEFFREY: "What about the germs?" I say. He goes, "I don't believe in germs. Germs are just a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soap!" Now, he's crazy, right? Hey, you believe in germs, don't you?
COLE: I'm not crazy.
JEFFREY: Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right? That's very sane. I can help you. You want me to, don't you? Get you out?
COLE: If you know how to escape, why don't you.?
JEFFREY: Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right? 'Cause I'd be crazy to escape! I'm all taken care of, see? I've sent out word.
COLE: What's that mean?
JEFFREY: I've managed to contact certain underlings, evil spirits, secretaries of secretaries, and assorted minions, who will contact my father. When he learns I'm in this kind of place, he'll have them transfer me to one of those classy joints where they treat you.properly.
JEFFREY: Sorry. Really sorry. Got a little agitated. The thought of escaping crossed my mind and suddenly.suddenly I felt LIKE BENDING THE FUCKING BARS
JEFFREY: You dumb assholes! I'm a mental patient! I'm supposed to act out. Wait til you morons find out who I am. My father's gonna be really upset. AND WHEN MY
COLE: They hurt you!
JEFFREY: Not as bad as what they're doing to ANGLE ON TV, showing a laboratory CAT turning in mad circles, eating its own tail, while a NEWS REPORTER narrates. These video tapes were obtained by animal rights activists who worked underground as laboratory assistants for several months. Authorities say there is little they can do until. The video footage now shows LAB WORKERS watching the results of their experiments passively. ANGLE ON COLE, reacting angrily.
COLE: Look at those assholes, they're asking for it! Maybe people deserved to be wiped out!
JEFFREY: ( startled, turning ) Wiping cut the human race! That's a great idea! But it's more of a long term thing right now we have to focus on more immediate goals. ( sudden whisper ) I didn't say a word about "you know What are you talking about???
COLE: What are you talking about???
JEFFREY: You know your plan. As COLE stares, befuddled, JEFFREY sees COLE'S magazine.
JEFFREY: What're you writing? You a reporter?
COLE: ( shielding the magazine ) It's private.
JEFFREY: A lawsuit? You going to sue them? Just then BILLINGS looms over COLE, extending a cup full of pills.
BILLINGS: Yo, James time to take your meds.
JEFFREY: Get it? Monk - Key. Monk! JEFFREY flashes his palm open for one quick moment. A KEY!
COLE: ( groggy ) Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load! Listen up try and get it together. Focus! Focus! The plan! Remember? I did my part.
JEFFREY: Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load! Listen up try and get it together. Focus! Focus! The plan! Remember? I did my part.
COLE: Not, "what", babe! When! Let us guide you to the stocks and bonds that will enhance your portfolio.
JEFFREY: Not, "what", babe! When! Let us guide you to the stocks and bonds that will enhance your portfolio.
JEFFREY: ( pressing the key into Cole's hand ) Let us guide you to the stocks and bonds that will enhance your portfolio.
JEFFREY: ( leaping to his feet )
JEFFREY: YES, YES. ENHANCE YOUR PORTFOLIO NOW! ANGLE ON BILLINGS, across the ward, reacting to JEFFREY, lets go of the OLD MAN he's helping as another orderly, TERRY, presses a beeper, calling for help. ANGLE ON COLE, flabbergasted, as JEFFREY cavorts around the room.
JEFFREY: BUY! SELL! SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY! ANGLE ON A HAND, inserting the last piece into the PEACEABLE KINGDOM JIGSAW PUZZLE. Just then, JEFFREY'S HAND sweeps the puzzle off the table, scattering it into a thousand pieces. ANGLE ON JEFFREY, dancing away while the PATIENT who just completed the puzzle stares, very upset. Other PATIENTS are getting agitated, too, as JEFFREY avoids a lunge by BILLINGS and dances off, using PATIENTS as a shield.
JEFFREY: OPPORTUNITY! DEFINITELY! A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY! OPENING NOW! NOW'S THE TIME FOR ALL GOOD MEN TO SEIZE THE MOMENT! YES! YES! MASTERCARD! VISA! THE KEY TO HAPPINESS! ANGLE ON COLE, realizing through the haze of drugs that JEFFREY is sending a message to him. COLE looks at the ward door. COLE'S POV: the WARD DOOR opens and two husky ORDERLIES enter. One locks the door with a key, one of many on a key ring attached to his belt, as the other ORDERLY rushes to join the pursuit.
JEFFREY: SEIZE THE MOMENT! GET RICH! NOW'S THE TIME! GO FOR IT! God damn you, Jeffrey, quit playing the fool. ANGLE ON COLE, hesitating. He locks at the door.blurring in and out of focus. He looks down at the key in his hand. ANGLE ON JEFFREY, being grabbed by the ORDERLIES. JEFFREY resists wildly as they struggle to overpower him.
BILLINGS: ( missing a tackle ) God damn you, Jeffrey, quit playing the fool. ANGLE ON COLE, hesitating. He locks at the door.blurring in and out of focus. He looks down at the key in his hand. ANGLE ON JEFFREY, being grabbed by the ORDERLIES. JEFFREY resists wildly as they struggle to overpower him.
JEFFREY: LAST CHANCE! LAST CHANCE! HEY OW! ANGLE ON COLE, moving to the door. He reaches it and tries to insert the key in the lock. ANGLE ON LOCK, as the key keeps missing the hole. ANGLE ON COLE, glancing nervously over his shoulder. COLE'S POV: ORDERLIES swarm over JEFFREY, don't notice COLE. ANGLE ON COLE, managing to insert the key. It won't turn. A PATIENT, close at hand, startles COLE, speaking into his ear.
PATIENT: Place to go would be.Florida. The keys are lovely this tine of year. COLE, unnerved, desperate tries the key again. It turns.
PATIENT: Be careful. J. Edgar Hoover isn't really dead. COLE pauses, stares, not understanding. Then, he opens the door.
DR. CASEY: This was in my box, but I have a slight suspicion it wasn't meant for me. CASEY enters the room, reading the scrawled words dramatically.
DR. CASEY: "You are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. You live in a beautiful world. But you don't know it. You have freedom, sunshine, air you can breathe."
RAILLY: ( smiling ) Cole. James Cole right? She reaches for the note but CASEY moves it out of her grasp.
DR. CASEY: "I would do anything to stay here, but I must leave. Please, help me."
RAILLY: Poor man. CASEY is handing her the note when another resident, DR. GOODINS, sticks his head in the door. He's upset.
DR. GOODINS: Hey, Kathryn, James Cole is one of yours, right? RAILLY and CASEY stare at him.
DR. GOODINS: He got out. Took off. Last seen, he was up on nine.
DOCTOR: Just relax don't fight it. We have to know exactly what's there so we can. The DOCTOR stops, astonished, as the door bursts open. It's COLE! He stares at the PATIENT and the Cat Scanner. The PATIENT lifts his head up and stares at COLE.
DOCTOR: Eh, excuse me. Can I help you? COLE turns and rushes back out the door.
RAILLY: It's just a shot to calm you.
COLE: No more drugs. Please.
RAILLY: I have to do this, James. You're very RAILLY pushes the needle into COLE'S skin.
DR. FLETCHER: Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't an inquisition.
RAILLY: I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just.
DR. FLETCHER: He should have been in restraints. It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple. why not just cop to it?
RAILLY: Okay, it was bad judgment. But I have the strangest feeling about him I've seen him somewhere and.
DR. FLETCHER: ( impatient, not interested ) Two policemen were already in the hospital and now we have an orderly with a broken arm and a Security Officer with a fractured skull.
RAILLY: I said it was bad judgment! What else do you want me to say?
DR. FLETCHER: You see what I mean? You're being defensive. Isn't she being defensive, Bob? But just then, BILLINGS sticks his head in the door.
BILLINGS: Uh, Dr. Fletcher we got another. INT. CORRIDOR/PSYCH WARD - MOMENTS LATER ( DAY ) DR. FLETCHER looks into an empty padded cell as RAILLY, MARTIN, GOODIN, BILLINGS, PALMER and the NURSE crowd behind him.
DR. FLETCHER: He was in full restraints? And the door was locked?
BILLINGS: Yes, sir. Did it myself.
DR. FLETCHER: And he was fully sedated?
RAILLY: He was fully sedated!
DR. FLETCHER: Then are you trying to tell me that a fully sedated, fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent, replaced the grill behind him and that he's wriggling through the ventilation system right now? DR. FLETCHER indicates an impossibly tiny vent high in the wall.
P.A. SYSTEM: Flight 784 to San Francisco now boarding at Gate 38. YOUNG COLE, watching the 747, whirls at the SOUND of a COMMOTION. MR. PONYTAIL bumps him. The BLONDE MAN sprints past. The WOMAN'S VOICE calls out!
WOMAN'S VOICE: TRAVELERS dive for cover briefly revealing the mysterious BRUNETTE running after the BLONDE MAN! But this time, YOUNG COLE catches just a glimpse of her face. She looks a little like RAILLY except for the dark hair, the make-up. and the flashy earrings. She calls out, her VOICE blending weirdly with the P.A. SYSTEM.
NOOOOOOOOOO!: TRAVELERS dive for cover briefly revealing the mysterious BRUNETTE running after the BLONDE MAN! But this time, YOUNG COLE catches just a glimpse of her face. She looks a little like RAILLY except for the dark hair, the make-up. and the flashy earrings. She calls out, her VOICE blending weirdly with the P.A. SYSTEM.
ASTROPHYSICIST: Uh, what?
COLE: Uh, what?
ENGINEER: He's drugged out of his mind! He's completely zoned out.
ASTROPHYSICIST: Cole, did you or did you not record that message?
COLE: Uh, that message.me?
MICROBIOLOGIST: It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number. Did you make that call?
COLE: ( angrily ) I couldn't call! You sent me to the wrong year! It was 1989.
SCIENTISTS: The SCIENTISTS react, exchanging looks, whispers. Then,
ZOOLOGIST: You're certain of that?
GEOLOGIST: ( before Cole can answer ) What did you do with your time, Cole? Did you waste it on drugs? Women?
COLE: They forced me to take drugs.
BOTANIST: Forced you! Why would someone force you to take drugs?
COLE: I got into trouble. I got arrested. But I still got you a specimen a spider but I didn't have anyplace to put it, so I ate it. It was the wrong year anyway, so I guess it doesn't matter. The SCIENTISTS stare incredulously, then turn, exchange knowing looks, huddle, start whispering to one another. Struggling to stay awake COLE sees, blurrily, the MICROBIOLOGIST staring at COLE intently. For one moment, the face belongs to
DR. FLETCHER!: COLE blinks hard.and the MICROBIOLOGIST has his own face, again. COLE'S head slumps forward now.and everything goes dark. INT. ENGINEERING OFFICE - ETERNAL NIGHT OF THE FUTURE COLE comes awake with a start. The room is dark now, except. a slide is being projected on a torn screen. It's a picture of a stenciled graffiti.the logo of The Army of the 12 Monkeys.
ENGINEER: What about it, Cole?
ZOOLOGIST: Did you see it?
COLE: Uh, no, sir. I. Another slide CLICKS into place. Youthful PROTESTERS, their placards featuring slogans and images of Animal Atrocities, confront POLICE in riot gear.
ASTROPHYSICIST: What about these people? Did you see any of these people? Zooming in, panning, the SCIENTISTS emphasize the FACES of the PROTESTERS. The FACES are unfamiliar to COLE ( though WE will recognize some of them later on ). Uh, no, sir, I.wait! The image pans back to a much enlarged blurry FACE among the PROTESTERS. In spite of the poor image, the expression of rage is clear, and it seems to resemble a somewhat older JEFFREY MASON.
ASTROPHYSICIST: Him? You saw that man?
COLE: Uh, I think so. In the mental hospital.
MICRO3IOLOGIST: ( switching on the light ) You were in a mental institution?! The SCIENTISTS MUTTER disapprovingly among themselves.
ASTROPHYSICIST: You were sent to make very important You could have made a real contribution.
BOTANIST: You could have made a real contribution.
GEOLOGIST: Helped to reclaim the planet.
ZOOLOGIST: As well as reducing your sentence.
MICROBIOLOGIST: The question is, Cole "Do you want another chance?" COLE stares at them, trying to figure out what they mean.
COLE: Where are you? You can talk! Wah'dja do, Bobby boy? My name's not "Bob". Not a prob, Bob. Where'd they send you?
COLE: My name's not "Bob". Not a prob, Bob. Where'd they send you?
COLE: Where are you? Another cell. . Maybe.
COLE: What do you mean, "maybe"? What's that supposed to mean? Maybe. Means "maybe" I'm in the next cell, another "volunteer" like you or "maybe" I'm in the Central Office spying on you for all those science bozos. Or, hey, "maybe" I'm not even here. "Maybe" I'm just in your head. No way to confirm anything. Ha Ha. Where'd they send you? COLE doesn't answer. Not talking, huh, Bob? That's okay I can handle that.
COLE: RASPY VOICE ( o.s. ) 89! How was it? Good drugs? Lotsa pussy? Hey, Bob, you do the job? D'ju find out the "big info"?.Army of the Twelve Monkeys.where the virus was prior to mutation?
COLE: It was supposed to be 1995. Science isn't an exact science with these clowns. You're lucky you didn't end up in ancient Egypt!
GEOLOGIST: No mistakes this time, Cole.
ASTROPHYSICIST: Stay alert. Keep your eyes open.
ZOOLOGIST: Good thinking about that spider, Cole. Try and do something like that again.
MICROBIOLOGIST: Just relax now don't fight it. We have to know exactly what's there so we can fix it. The gurney is being wheeled into a crudely welded steel tube. reminiscent of the cat scanner in County Hospital. COLE'S POV: a last glimpse of anxious FACES, then the chamber door is CLANGED shut.
SERGEANT: ( FRENCH, subtitled ) Where's your mask?! And your clothes. and your weapon, you idiot?!
COLE: What? What?? COLE looks around desperately. A horribly WOUNDED MAN is being stretchered past them in the narrow trench. Machine guns chatter close at hand. AAK AAK AAK. A grenade EXPLODES. Reacting to the foreign word, the SERGEANT jams his bayonet into COLE'S ribs.
SERGEANT: ( FRENCH, subtitled ) Captain! A Kraut! We got a Kraut!
COLE: I don't understand. Where am I? The CAPTAIN hurries over, snapping at COLE in German.
CAPTAIN: ( GERMAN, subtitled ) How'd you get here, soldier? What's your rank? Where are your clothes?
COLE: I.don't understand.
CAPTAIN: ( frowning, GERMAN, subtitled ) German! Speak German! What are you doing here? ( pleading in English ) I gotta find 'em. I gotta find 'em. Please, you gotta help me! COLE turns, sees. It's his friend, JOSE, the Puerto Rican kid from the next cell in the "underground" time. He's being carried past COLE now on a stretcher, blood all over his torso, horribly wounded.
COLE: Cole! Oh, God, Cole, where are we? JOSE reaches out to COLE just as a PHOTOGRAPHER takes a FLASH PICTURE of the kid being carried off on the stretcher. SUDDENLY, SHOTS RING OUT. COLE goes down. Hit in the leg! SOLDIERS in gas masks rush past him like giant insects. Looking to his left, COLE sees the CAPTAIN lying beside him, dead from a chest wound, his gas mask half off. COLE is reaching for the mask when.
JOSE!: Cole! Oh, God, Cole, where are we? JOSE reaches out to COLE just as a PHOTOGRAPHER takes a FLASH PICTURE of the kid being carried off on the stretcher. SUDDENLY, SHOTS RING OUT. COLE goes down. Hit in the leg! SOLDIERS in gas masks rush past him like giant insects. Looking to his left, COLE sees the CAPTAIN lying beside him, dead from a chest wound, his gas mask half off. COLE is reaching for the mask when.
JOSE: Cole! Oh, God, Cole, where are we? JOSE reaches out to COLE just as a PHOTOGRAPHER takes a FLASH PICTURE of the kid being carried off on the stretcher. SUDDENLY, SHOTS RING OUT. COLE goes down. Hit in the leg! SOLDIERS in gas masks rush past him like giant insects. Looking to his left, COLE sees the CAPTAIN lying beside him, dead from a chest wound, his gas mask half off. COLE is reaching for the mask when.
MAY 17: INT. AUDITORIUM/BREITROSE HALL - NIGHT A large screen dominates the auditorium stage. On the screen is a slide of an engraving from the Middle Ages showing a MADMAN in apparent agony, his mouth shaped to a scream, as he is restrained by PEASANTS. The projector ZOOMS slowly in on the agonized FACE of this MADMAN as we HEAR RAILLY'S VOICE lecturing. WE DISCOVER RAILLY, six years older now, standing at a lectern in a pool of light. She's dwarfed by the giant screen where the engraving is replaced by a series of slides of woodcuts showing scenes of pestilence in the Middle Ages as she lectures to an audience of mostly SCHOLARLY TYPES. ON THE SCREEN, a SERIES of SLIDES show images of WORLD WAR I SOLDIERS in gas masks, in death throes, etc.. ON THE SCREEN, a slide of an old deteriorated photograph shows JOSE, the Puerto Rican kid, strapped to a stretcher, being carried by SOLDIERS through the trenches during an attack. JOSE appears to be ranting madly as the projector ZOOMS CLOSER on his face until the image approximates Munch's famous painting. The AUDIENCE gives a nervous CHUCKLE. ON THE SCREEN, a different old photograph of JOSE. This time he's in a military hospital, gaunt, haunted, very ill. As RAILLY continues, we SCAN the AUDIENCE and DISCOVER MARILOU MARTIN, RAILLY'S friend, and MARILOU'S HUSBAND, WAYNE CHANG, both listening attentively. Further away, another MAN listens intently. A MAN with shoulder-length carrot-colored hair. His name is DR. PETERS.
DR. PETERS: I think, Dr. Railly, you have given your alarmists a bad name. Surely there is very real and very convincing data that the planet cannot survive the excesses of the human race: proliferation of atomic devices, uncontrolled breeding habits, the rape of the environment, the pollution of land, sea, and air. In this context, isn't it obvious that "Chicken Little" represents the sane vision and that Homo Sapiens' motto, "Let's go shopping!" is the cry of the true lunatic? DR. PETERS smiles self-importantly at RAILLY as an elderly disheveled PROFESSOR elbows in front of him.
DISHEVELED PROFESSOR: Doctor Railly please! I wonder if you're aware of my own studies which indicate that certain cycles of the moon actually impact on the incidence of apocalyptic predictions as observed in urban emergency rooms and. As the PROFESSOR babbles, MARILOU MARTIN and her husband, WAYNE CHANG, appear and whisper.
MARILOU: You were great.
RAILLY: You're leaving?
MARILOU: The reservation's at nine thirty it's getting late.
DISHEVELED PROFESSOR: Doctor Railly please this is very You sure you're gonna be all right?
WAYNE CHANG: ( checking the professor ) You sure you're gonna be all right?
RAILLY: ( smiles, checks her watch ) I'll be there in twenty minutes.
DISHEVELED PROFESSOR: Dr. Railly, I simply cannot understand your exclusion of the moon in relation to apocalyptic dementia.
MAN'S VOICE: Get in! Unable to scream, she writhes and kicks as he forces her into the front seat.
MAN'S VOICE: I've got a gun. RAILLY freezes, terrified, as he opens the rear door and scrambles in behind her.
RAILLY: You can have my purse. I have a lot of cash and credit. Start the car. Glancing in the rear view mirror, RAILLY sees penetrating eyes peering out of the shadows, no other features. Half-turning in the seat, she holds out the keys to him.
RAILLY: Here! You can have the keys. You can. He grabs her hair and yanks her head back hard, speaking fiercely into her ear, his face last in shadow.
MAN: START THE CAR! NOW! EXT. ACURA/PARKING LOT The engine STARTS, the Acura backs up, then heads for the exit.
RAILLY: Where. where are we going'
MAN: I need you to drive me to Philadelphia.
RAILLY: ( startled, horrified ) But that's. that's more than 200 miles!
MAN: That's why I can't walk there. Turn here. I think. RAILLY obeys. She glances in the mirror again, hesitates, then boldly switches on the dome light, holding her breath fearfully for his reaction. He grunts appreciatively. Relieved, she looks in the mirror again, trying to get a better look at him, but now his features are concealed by the map.
RAILLY: If you make me go with you, it's kidnapping. That's a serious crime. If you let me go, you could just take the car and.
MAN: I don't know how to drive! We went underground when I was nine, I told you that. When you come to the corner, turn right. Startled, RAILLY whirls, looks right at him. He's lowered the map. It's COLE! Haggard, unshaven, dirty.
RAILLY: Cole! James Cole! You escaped from a locked room six years ago.
COLE: 1989. Six years for you. There's the sign! Right here! COLE is indicating a freeway entrance. RAILLY turns the wheel sharply.
RAILLY: I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole. Have you been.following me?
COLE: You told me you'd help me. I know this isn't what you meant, but.I was desperate. no money.bum leg. sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad. Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture. I can read, remember?
RAILLY: Yes, I remember. Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
COLE: It's the next step. I checked out the Baltimore information, it was nothing. It's Philadelphia, that's where they are, the ones who killed everyone. Zs that a radio? Does it play music? RAILLY turns on the radio and immediately WE HEAR the SOUND of SURF and the CRIES of gulls, background to an oozing baritone COMMERCIAL. This is a personal message to you. COLE sits up, alert, listening intently. Are you at the end of your rope? Are you dying to get away? COLE'S eyes narrow, concentrating on this personal message. The Florida Keys are waiting for you. COLE frowns as the SOUND of breaking SURF and crying GULLS fills the car. It's confusing! He blurts out.
COLE: I've never seen the ocean! Observing his confusion in the mirror, RAILLY assumes her professional tone.
RAILLY: It's an advertisement, Mr. Cole. You do understand that, don't you? It's not really a special message to you. COLE frowns. He did think it was for him, but she's probably right.
COLE: You used to call me "James".
RAILLY: You'd prefer that? . James.you don't really have a gun, do you.
COLE: ( cynical laugh ) Everybody's got a gun. In this city. He breaks off reacting to the RADIO MUSIC! FATS DOMINO singing "BLUEBERRY HILL"! COLE grins, mouth agape, eyes wide like a kid's.
COLE: Can you.can you make it louder? I love hearing twentieth century music! Hearing music and breathing air! As RAILLY cranks up the volume, she watches the mirror incredulously, sees him stick his head out the window into the wind, mouth open, "eating" the air hungrily.
COLE: "Never cry wolf!"
RAILLY: My father told me that. "Never cry wolf." Then people won't believe you if.something really happens.
COLE: My father told me that. "Never cry wolf." Then people won't believe you if.something really happens.
RAILLY: "If something really happens".like what, James?
COLE: Something bad. Is that all the music? I don't want to hear this stuff. RAILLY glances at him as she scans stations.
RAILLY: Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child? Something so bad.?
COLE: Ohhhh, that one! Can we hear that one? It's IVORY JOE HUNTER singing, "SINCE I MET YOU, BABY". "Since I met you, baby, My whole life has changed. Ecstatic, COLE sticks his head out the window again.
ANSWERING MACHINE: Dr. Railly this is Palmer from Psych Admitting. There was a guy here this afternoon looking for you. He seemed very agitated. We tried to keep him, but he refused 'n I kept thinking, I know this guy. Then, just a few minutes ago, it came to me. It's Cole! James Cole. Remember him? The paranoid who pulled the Houdini back in '89. Well, he's back and he's.cuckoo.and he's looking for you. I thought you oughta know. The machine switches off. The POLICE OFFICERS exchange a look.
MARILOU MARTIN: It's just as I told you my husband and I had gone ahead she never showed. That's totally unlike her!
OFFICER TWO: ( pulls out his notebook ) Do you happen to know the make of her car?
MARILOU MARTIN: Um.Acura.'92 Acura. . Also, that cat's starving! She would never neglect her cat!
COLE: You were in my dream just now. Your hair was different, but I'm sure it was you.
RAILLY: We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours. What was the dream about?
COLE: About an airport.before everything happened. It's the same dream I always have the only one. I'm a little kid in it.
RAILLY: And I was in it? What did I do?
COLE: You were very upset. You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before.
RAILLY: It wasn't me before, James. It's become me now because of.what's happening. Please untie me. Finished shaving, COLE re-enters the bedroom, toweling his face.
COLE: No, I think it was always you. It's very strange.
RAILLY: You're flushed. And you were moaning. I think you're running a fever. What are you doing? COLE is rummaging through RAILLY'S wallet, pulling out money.
COLE: I'll be back in a minute. He heads for the door.
RAILLY: No! Don't leave me here like this! Too late! He shuts the door behind him, leaving her alone. ANGLE ON THE TV SCREEN, where an ANCHORMAN sits at a News Set.
TV ANCHORMAN: And in Fresno, California.crews continue to attempt to rescue nine year old Ricky Neuman. ANGLE ON RAILLY, twisting and struggling on the bed, trying to get loose, tears welling in her eyes. The boy was playing ball with four other children when he literally disappeared off the face of the earth.
COLE: My notes. Observations. Clues.
RAILLY: Clues? What kind of clues?
COLE: A secret army. The Army of The Twelve Monkeys. I've told you about them. They spread the virus. That's why we have to get to Philadelphia. I have to find them it's my assignment.
RAILLY: What will you do.when you find this.secret army?
COLE: I just have to locate the virus in its original form before it mutates. So scientists can come back and study it and find a cure. So that those of us who survived can go back to the surface of the earth. RAILLY maintains a professional deadpan, says nothing as they pass a pickup truck with a MOTHER, FATHER, and five KIDS in the back. COLE stares at the KIDS, a sad look in his eyes.
COLE: You won't think I'm crazy next month. People are going to start dying. At first the papers will say it's some weird fever, some virus. Then they'll begin to catch on. They'll get it. We interrupt this program with a special bulletin. RAILLY and COLE both react to the radio, suddenly alert. This report just in from Fresno, California. Naval sonar specialists who were flown to the site.
COLE: I thought it was about us. I thought maybe they'd found us and arrested me or something. RAILLY stares at COLE.
COLE: Just a joke. an hour ago have been unable to determine the location of the boy in the 150 foot shaft.but a TV sound man who lowered an ultra-sensitive microphone into the narrow tube claims he heard breathing sounds coming from approximately seventy feet down. COLE reaches over and changes stations. MUSIC again.
RAILLY: Does that disturb you, James? Thinking about that little boy in the well?
COLE: When I was a kid I identified with that kid, down there alone in that pipe.a hundred feet down doesn't know if they're going to save him.
RAILLY: What do you mean when you were a kid?
COLE: Nevermind. It's not real it's a hoax. A prank. He's hiding in a barn. Hey, turn left here. Left! COLE quickly checks the map as RAILLY stares, then turns left.
EVANGELIST: "And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses and dragons in their pleasant palaces: and her time is near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged." ANGLE ON RAILLY'S ACURA, crawling down the street, RAILLY driving, COLE, beside her, staring out the window.
COLE: Where I come from we think of this as Eden. If we could just see the sun, eat sun-grown food. Eden! Look at them! They donut know what they have. They don't see the sky. They don't feel the air! COLE'S POV: a BMW speeds toward them, passes, its radio BLARING! And the ones who aren't hungry are so smug they haven't a clue. WAIT! STOP!
COLE: The Twelve Monkeys!!! They're here. Somewhere. Come on! He pulls her along the sidewalk. No question, he's insane. At the next alley entrance, COLE stops abruptly. Then, still keeping a firm grip on RAILLY'S arm, he starts ripping down newly tacked-up posters announcing a Rap concert. RAILLY stares at him, then turns and is looking all around when, suddenly, COLE pulls her up tight and threatens.
COLE: Look, I'm warning you. You do anything, I'm going to go crazy hurt people!
RAILLY: I'm not going to "do" anything, I promise. But you need help, James. None of this is what you think it is. ANGLE ON COLE, not listening, staring triumphantly! He's found another partially obscured stencil of THE TWELVE MONKEYS! But just then, a raspy VOICE startles COLE. You can't hide from them, Bob. COLE whirls, sees a derelict, LOUIE, leering at him, speaking in a voice eerily like the RASPY VOICE from the next cell in the future.
LOUIE: No, sir, Old Bob don't even try. They hear everything. They got that tracking device on you. They can find you anywhere. Anytime. Ha Ha! RAILLY looks from LOUIS to COLE, sees COLE'S stunned reaction.
LOUIE: ( touches his back jaw ) In the tooth, Bob! Right? ( sudden triumphant grin ) But I fooled 'em, old buddy! He opens his mouth wide. NO TEETH' COLE grabs RAILLY and pulls her into the alley and down it.
COLE: They're keeping an eye on me.
RAILLY: Who's keeping an eye on you?
COLE: The man.with the voice. I recognized him. He's from the present. He. COLE breaks off, freezes as he sees. there on a brick wall is a stencil of the DANCING MONKEYS And further on, another red stencil!
RAILLY: James, no we shouldn't be here! COLE ignores her, yanking her after him into the alley.
RAILLY: James! We have to go back. Those men. Too late. While COLE turns and stares at her, uncomprehending, the TWO THUGS are approaching.
FIRST THUG: Hey, buddy. Startled, COLE turns to face them. The SECOND THUG lunges for RAILLY'S purse, yanks it from her. COLE reaches to grab it back, but.WHACK! The FIRST THUG smacks COLE hard across the face with something metallic. Bloody-faced, dazed, COLE doesn't even have a chance to clear his head as the FIRST THUG shoves the hard object against COLE'S cheek. It's a cheap thirty-eight pistol. RAILLY turns to run, gets two steps before the SECOND THUG knocks her roughly to the ground.
SECOND THUG: Stick around, bitch. Looming over her, the SECOND THUG starts to unzip his fly. RAILLY looks over to COLE, SEES. COLE dropping to his knees, groveling at the FIRST THUG'S feet.
COLE: Please! Please don't hurt me! The FIRST THUG steps close, kicks COLE contemptuously, cocks his foot for a second kick when. COLE uncoils, lunging, rising, his strong arms around the bigger man's calves, lifting him mightily, high off the ground. The gun FIRES wildly as COLE staggers forward with the FIRST THUG in his arms and smashes the man into the brick wail behind him. The FIRST THUG goes down in a heap, dropping the pistol. Zipping his fly hastily, the SECOND THUG turns to deal with COLE but COLE attacks him..rocking him again and again with savage blows that come one after another with lightning speed. The SECOND THUG staggers back, bloody and dazed as RAILLY watches, amazed. Turning back to the FIRST THUG, COLE sees the MAN reaching for the dropped pistol. COLE kicks him viciously in the jaw. The FIRST THUG'S head whips back. SNAP! He collapses against the brick wall. COLE turns back to see the SECOND THUG retreating down the alley as fast as he can stagger. RAILLY stares up at COLE. He looks very dangerous. He glances in her direction as he pockets the pistol.
COLE: Are you hurt?
RAILLY: Uh, no. Yes. I mean, just some scrapes. As RAILLY gets to her feet, she sees COLE bend over the motionless THUG and quickly go through his pockets.
RAILLY: Is he.alive? COLE ignores the question as he pockets the man's wallet and a handful of bullets, then turns and snaps at RAILLY.
COLE: Come an. We're running out of time. You can't help him. As COLE yanks her roughly away, she looks back, sees the FIRST THUG'S sightless eyes, wide open.staring blankly.
RAILLY: Oh, Jesus, James! You killed him!
COLE: I did him a favor. Now come on. COLE, pulling her again, sees more "12 MONKEYS" on the wall.
RAILLY: You didn't have a gun before, did you?
COLE: I've got one now.
EVANGELIST: You! You! You're one of us, aren't you? But COLE has stopped and is staring at. A STOREFRONT OFFICE.its windows covered with posters. The sign over the office says, FREEDOM FOR ANIMALS ASSOCIATION.
FALE: Uh, can we help you? COLE looks confused as the RAIN abates and an ELEPHANT trumpets an urgent warning.
FALE: Excuse me. You looking for something in particular?
RAILLY: It's all right, James it's just a tape. COLE'S eyes follow her look. It's a tape recorder underneath a sign advertising, "THE TRUE MUSIC OF THE WORLD".
COLE: I, uh, I'm looking for the, ah, the Army of the Twelve Monkeys. FALE glances at BEN and TEDDY. "We have a problem!" the look says. MONKEYS start CHATTERING on the tape as TEDDY comes around the counter, bigger than COLE, physically imposing, menacing.
TEDDY: We don't know anything about any "Army of the Twelve Monkeys", so why don't you and your friend disappear, okay? COLE backs away, a firm grip on RAILLY, as a LION ROARS.
COLE: I just need some information.
TEDDY: Didn't you hear me? We're not. TEDDY breaks off mid-sentence.freezes. COLE is pointing a pistol at them. A TIGER SNARLS.
RAILLY: James, no don't hurt them. Please, I'm a psychiatrist just do whatever he tells you to do. He's. upset disturbed. Please he's dangerous just cooperate. MONKEYS CHATTER wildly as TEDDY backs up.
FALE: What do you want money? We only have a few bucks. COLE is suddenly very much in charge and self-confident again. A BABOON HOWLS with laughter.
COLE: I told you what I want. Lock the door!
RAILLY: James, why don't we.?
COLE: Lock it now! RAILLY hurries to the door to lock it as BEN says to FALE,
BEN: I told you that fuckhead Mason would get us into something like this.
FALE: Shut up!
COLE: Jeffrey Mason?
RAILLY: Jeffrey Mason?
BEN: Yeah, tucking, crazy Jeffrey Mason.
FALE: Then, Jeffrey becomes like this.big star the media latch on to him because he's picketing his own father, a "famous Nobel Prize winning virologist". You musta seen all that on TV.
COLE: No, I don't watch TV. COLE, the gun next to him, rummages through boxes of papers while RAILLY watches helplessly. Suddenly, COLE finds something he thinks he's seen before. He holds it up.
COLE: Is this him Dr. Mason? It's a photograph of DR. MALCOLM MASON, being escorted by a phalanx of riot cops through a mob of raging activists.
FALE: That's him.
BEN: ( very frightened ) What are you going to do with us?
COLE: ( stares at the photo, then ) Tell me more about Jeffrey.
FALE: ( a helpless shrug to his cohorts ) Jeffrey started getting bored with the shit we do.picketing, leafleting, letter-writing stuff. He said we were, "ineffectual liberal jerkoffs". He wanted to do guerrilla "actions" to "educate" the public. COLE holds up a clipping showing horrified SENATORS standing on their desks as RATTLESNAKES slither along the Senate Floor.
FALE: Yeah, that's when he let a hundred snakes loose in the Senate.
TEDDY: But we weren't into that kind of stuff. It's counter productive, we told him.
FALE: So he and eleven others split off and became this underground."army"
COLE: The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.
BEN: They started planning a "Human Hunt".
TEDDY: They bought stun guns and nets and bear traps. They were gonna go to Wall Street and trap lawyers and bankers.
BEN: But they didn't do it. They didn't do any of it.
TEDDY: Yeah, just like always, Mr. Big Shot sold his friends out!
COLE: What's that mean?
FALE: He goes on TV, gives a news conference, tells the whole world he just realized his daddy's experiments are vital for humanity and that the use of animals is absolutely necessary and that he, Jeffrey Mason, from now on, is going to personally supervise the labs to make sure all the little animals aren't going to suffer.
COLE: ( holding up a rolodex ) What's this?
RAILLY: If those young men don't get loose, they could die in that basement. COLE glances out the window, indicates the PEOPLE in passing cars.COMMUTERS, FAMILIES, TRUCKERS.
COLE: All I see are dead people. Everywhere. What's three more?
RAILLY: ( a beat, carefully, a new tack ) You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey Mason, don't you, James? You met him in the County Hospital six years ago. COLE is studying the map again.
COLE: The guy was a total fruitcake.
RAILLY: And he told you then his father was a famous virologist. COLE is absorbed in the map, his finger tracing "Outerbridge Road".
COLE: No he said his father was "God"!
RAILLY: This can't go on, James. You're not well. You're burning with fever. COLE, refusing to succumb, instead, leans over to check the gas gauge.
COLE: We need gas.
RAILLY: I thought you didn't know how to drive.
COLE: I said I was too young to drive. I didn't say I was stupid.
RAILLY: What's the matter with your leg?
COLE: I got shot. Look there's a gas station up ahead.
RAILLY: Shot! Who shot you?
COLE: It was some kind of.war. Never mind, you wouldn't believe me. Turn off here.
COLE: You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you?
RAILLY: No. I want you to turn yourself in, James It'll go much better for you if you do but I'm not going to trick you.
COLE: ( sees the credit card ) That has your name on it. Give him cash. RAILLY puts the card back into her wallet and pulls out cash as the GAS STATION ATTENDANT slams the hood down. RAILLY starts opening the door. Alarmed, COLE tries to stop her.
COLE: Where are you going? She looks him in the eye, then indicates the tiny Convenience Store appended to the Gas Station.
RAILLY: You can come with me. I have to get some things. Scissors, bandages, some alcohol or whiskey. . I have to look at your leg, James. I'm a doctor. COLE looks helpless, hesitant. She's in charge.for the moment.
RAILLY: You shouldn't put your weight on it. You need stitches and antibiotics. Lucky for you it was near the surface. RAILLY wraps the bullet in some gauze and sticks it in her pocket while COLE continues staring up at the sky.
COLE: I love seeing the sun. A beat. COLE tries to stand up.
RAILLY: Wait let me help you. RAILLY puts an arm around him and helps him to his feet. A beat. They're very close. They don't move. RAILLY looks like she can barely breathe.
COLE: ( leans closer, shuts his eyes ) You smell so good.
RAILLY: ( trying to concentrate ) You have to give yourself up, you know. A beat. The spell is broken. He reaches for his pants, then turns back to her, suddenly grim.
COLE: I have to do something now. Something I don't want to do. I'm so sorry. RAILLY reacts, sudden fear in her eyes. He looms over her. He's cold now, steeled.
COLE: I have a mission. It's important. RAILLY steps back.horrified, realizing she's going to die.
FIRST AGENT: They find him?
SECOND AGENT: FIRST AGENT That kid. The one in the pipe.
FIRST AGENT: That kid. The one in the pipe.
SECOND AGENT: You believe this? They're dropping a monkey down there with a miniature infra-red camera strapped on him and a roast beef sandwich wrapped in tinfoil.
FIRST AGENT: You're making that up! ANGLE UNDER A PARKED MERCEDES, where COLE is hiding, listening to the receding VOICES of the AGENTS. I shit you not. . Man, life is weird! A monkey and a sandwich. Wonder who thought that one up. Probly give the sonafabitch a Nobel Quickly, COLE rolls to the next car and under it. He doesn't see.the pistol fell out of his pocket, under the Mercedes.
DR. MASON: Would that I could enjoy this opulent dinner and this excellent and stimulating company for itself, with no sense of purpose. But alas, I am "burdened" with the sense that with all this excess of public attention and this cacophony of praise, there comes great responsibility. Indeed, I practically feel a soapbox growing under my feet whenever I stand for more than a few seconds. While GUESTS laugh at DR. MASON'S last remark, SECRET SERVICE AGENT #3 enters the room, scowling, looking for someone. The dangers of science are a time worn threat, from Prometheus stealing fire from the Gods to the Cold War era of the Dr. Strangelove Terror. AGENT #3 spots who he's looking for. JEFFREY MASON! But never before, not even at Los Alamos when the scientists made bets on whether their first atomic bomb test would wipe out New Mexico, has science given us so much reason to fear the power we have at hand. ANGLE ON JEFFREY, as AGENT #3 whispers in his ear.
JEFFREY: What are you talking about? What friend? I'm not expecting anyone. ANGLE ON DR. MASON, reacting with irritation to the disturbance.
DR. MASON: Current genetic engineering as well as my own work with viruses has presented us with powers as terrifying as any. ANGLE ON JEFFREY, following the AGENT out of the dining room, grumbling loudly enough to disturb his father's audience.
JEFFREY: This is ridiculous. My father is making a major address.
AGENT #3: Normally if we caught a guy sneaking around like this with no I.D., we'd bust his ass, excuse the French, but this one said he knows you. and, since you seem to have had we certainly didn't want to arrest one of your, uh, closest.pals.
JEFFREY: ( dismissing Cole casually ) Never saw him before in my life. Go ahead and shoot him or torture him or whatever it is you do.
COLE: ( rising ) You do know me. You helped me once.
JEFFREY: ( turning to leave ) That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles. ( to the Agents ) See, he definitely doesn't know me. Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS
COLE: I'm here about some monkeys. Halfway out the door, JEFFREY freezes. A beat.
JEFFREY: Excuse me what did you say?
COLE: Monkeys. Twelve of them. JEFFREY frowns, turns, considers COLE. Then, suddenly, JEFFREY rushes to COLE and embraces him.
JEFFREY: COLE is astonished. The AGENTS are, too.
JEFFREY: ( stepping back ) My God, Arnie, what's happened to you? You look like shit
AGENT #3: ( dubious ) You know this man?
JEFFREY: Of course I know him. What do you think I act like this to strangers? Listen you fellas are terrific. I thought you were pulling a number on me. What a terrible thing if you'd thrown old Arnie out. I owe you guys the big apologia! Mea culpa, fellas. Christ, Arnie, it's black tie! I mean, I said, "drop by," but, like, this is Dad's big "do".vips, senators, secret service, and.and everything. JEFFREY throws an arm around COLE'S shoulder and starts leading him toward the door as the two AGENTS exchange narrow-eyed looks.
AGENT #4: Arnold Pettibone. Old Arnie Pettibone. Used to be my best friend. Still is. What've you lost, Arnie forty pounds? No wonder I didn't know you. You hungry? Lots of dead cow, dead lamb, dead pig. Real killer feast we're putting on tonight. The AGENTS watch JEFFREY lead the limping, disheveled COLE out.
JEFFREY: Arnold Pettibone. Old Arnie Pettibone. Used to be my best friend. Still is. What've you lost, Arnie forty pounds? No wonder I didn't know you. You hungry? Lots of dead cow, dead lamb, dead pig. Real killer feast we're putting on tonight. The AGENTS watch JEFFREY lead the limping, disheveled COLE out.
AGENT #4: These people all of 'em are true I'm gonna call in a description of this "Pettibone" character. You go keep an eye on him. Make sure he doesn't do one of the guests with a fork.
AGENT #3: ( moving to the phone ) I'm gonna call in a description of this "Pettibone" character. You go keep an eye on him. Make sure he doesn't do one of the guests with a fork.
JEFFREY: Hey, nice ta see ya. Lookin' good! Hi, there. Yes, it has been a long time. In the b.g., too far away to hear them, AGENT #4 trails JEFFREY and COLE as they maneuver through the GUESTS toward the grand staircase.
JEFFREY: ( whispers to Cole ) County Hospital, right? 1989. The "Immaculate Escape" am I right? ( smiling to guests ) Why, thank you you look wonderful, too.
COLE: Listen to me I can't do anything about what you're going to do. I can't change anything. I can't stop you. I just want some information.
JEFFREY: We need to talk. Come on. Upstairs. I am a new person! I'm completely adjusted. Witness the tux. It's Armani. Who chattered? Goines? Weller?
COLE: I just need to have access to the pure virus, that's all! For the future! JEFFREY studies COLE. COLE doesn't just talk crazy. He looks crazy!
JEFFREY: Come on, follow me. You don't lock so good. JEFFREY starts guiding COLE up the grand staircase as COLE, glancing back, spots AGENT #3 and AGENT #4, both keeping an eye on him now.
COLE: I don't have time to go upstairs. The police are looking for me. I need to know where it is and exactly what it is.
JEFFREY: ( brightening suddenly ) I get it! This is your old plan, right?
COLE: Plan? What are you talking about?
JEFFREY: Remember? We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the.desecration of the planet. And you said to me, "Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?" You do remember that, don't you?
COLE: Bulishit! You're fucking with my head!
JEFFREY: And that's when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, "Hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it!"
COLE: ( grabbing Jeffrey ) Listen, you dumb fuck! The thing mutates We live underground! The world belongs to the fucking dogs and cats. We're like moles or worms. All we want to do is study the original.
AGENT #4: Let's go somewhere and talk this thing over. Okay? Just come with me.
JEFFREY: You're right! Absolutely right. Me's a nut case, totally deranged. Delusional! Paranoid. HIS PROCESSOR'S ALL FUCKED
JEFFREY: YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS, THE "ARMY OF THE TWELVE MONKEYS"? IT'S A COLLECTION OF NATURE KOOKS WHO RUN A STORE DOWNTOWN. SPACE-CASE DO-GOODERS SAVING RAIN FORESTS. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THOSE BOZOS ANYMORE. I QUIT BEING THE RICH KID FALL GUY FOR A BUNCH OF INEFFECTUAL BANANAS. SO MUCH FOR YOUR GRAND PLOT! COLE stares back at JEFFREY as both AGENTS hustle COLE down the stairs. It sounds true! JEFFREY'S so confident.
GRAND PLOT!: COLE stares back at JEFFREY as both AGENTS hustle COLE down the stairs. It sounds true! JEFFREY'S so confident.
AGENT #3: Take it easy, Mr. Mason, we've got him. MY FATHER HAS BEEN WARNING PEOPLE ABOUT THE DANGERS OF EXPERIMENTATION WITH VIRUSES AND DNA FOR YEARS. YOU'VE "PROCESSED" THAT INFORMATION THROUGH YOUR ADDLED PARANOID INFRA-STRUCTURE AND LO AND BEHOLD, I'M FRANKENSTEIN AND THE "ARMY OF THE TWELVE MONKEYS" BECOMES SOME SORT OF SINISTER REVOLUTIONARY CABAL. THIS MAN IS TOTALLY BATSHIT! YOU KNOW WHERE HE THINKS HE COMES FROM??? Suddenly, COLE, catching the AGENTS by surprise, wrenches free, shoves them aside, and stumbles down the rest of the staircase.
JEFFREY: MY FATHER HAS BEEN WARNING PEOPLE ABOUT THE DANGERS OF EXPERIMENTATION WITH VIRUSES AND DNA FOR YEARS. YOU'VE "PROCESSED" THAT INFORMATION THROUGH YOUR ADDLED PARANOID INFRA-STRUCTURE AND LO AND BEHOLD, I'M FRANKENSTEIN AND THE "ARMY OF THE TWELVE MONKEYS" BECOMES SOME SORT OF SINISTER REVOLUTIONARY CABAL. THIS MAN IS TOTALLY BATSHIT! YOU KNOW WHERE HE THINKS HE COMES FROM??? Suddenly, COLE, catching the AGENTS by surprise, wrenches free, shoves them aside, and stumbles down the rest of the staircase.
AGENT #4: Did a man just come through here.limping?
COLE: LIGHTS! LIGHTS! He starts hitting switches. The wipers come on, the RADIO BLARES. -when they pulled the monkey out, it was still clutching the tinfoil wrapped Rounding a bend, an ONCOMING CAR heads straight at COLE. COLE yanks the wheel as the OTHER CAR, horn BLARING, just misses him. Recovering, COLE loses the road, speeds crazily along the shoulder.
PILOT: There! He's showing lights.
PILOT: Goddamnit! Where is he? The CO-PILOT gets a brief glimpse of headlights through the leaves.
PILOT: Eight o'clock! He was right there. The headlights are gone. Nothing but darkness below.
PILOT: He musta turned his lights of if.
PILOT: Maybe he's not driving!
POLICE OFFICER: He's not in here.
RAILLY: You bastard! You total bastard!
RAILLY: I could have died in there. If something had happened to you I would have died. COLE is lying on the ground, looking up, his lip caked with blood.
COLE: I.I.I'm really sorry. Noticing his cuts and torn clothes, she stops kicking him.
RAILLY: What have you done? Did you.kill someone?
COLE: ( getting to his feet ) No! I.don't think so. I stole a car and they chased me. I hit a tree.
RAILLY: See you can drive after all!
COLE: Yeah, sort of, I guess. I.I'm sorry I locked you up. I thought.I thought. I think maybe I am crazy! She looks at him. Breakthrough? Very calm now, the doctor.
RAILLY: What made you think that?
COLE: Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the virus. And suddenly, I wasn't sure. We talked when I was in the institution, and it was all.fuzzy. The drugs and stuff. You think maybe I'm the one who wiped out the human race? It was my idea?
RAILLY: Nobody is going to wipe out the human race. Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else. You've created something in your mind, James a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.
COLE: I'm."mentally divergent". I would love to believe that.
RAILLY: It can be dealt with, but only if you want to. I can help you. COLE reacts to the sound of VOICES in the woods, dogs BARKING.
COLE: I need help all right. They're coming after me.
RAILLY: First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running. Okay?
COLE: ( brightening ) It would be great if I'm crazy. If I'm wrong about everything.the world will be okay. I'll never have to live underground.
RAILLY: Give me the gun.
COLE: The gun! . I lost it
RAILLY: You're sure?
COLE: ( showing her ) No gun! ( looking up ) Stars! Air! I can live here. Breathe! RAILLY starts around to the front of the car.
RAILLY: I'm going to attract their attention, let them know where we are, okay? RAILLY gets in the driver's seat.and starts to HONK the horn.
RAILLY: ( calling out ) They'll tell you to put your hands on top of your head. Do what they tell you. You're going to get better, James I know it! ANGLE ON COLE, spotting something on the ground. An insect! He reaches down to grab it, but, instead, grins, grabs some grass, stands, and starts rubbing it happily all over his face. The HORN BLARES as COLE looks up at the sky. ANGLE ON THE NIGHT SKY, the moon full, the sky rich with stars. ANGLE ON COLE, tears of joy running down his face.
COLE: I love this world! ANGLE ON RAILLY, in the driver's seat, hearing near-by SHOUTS from the woods. The police are almost here. She gets out of the car, starts around toward COLE.
RAILLY: Remember, I'm going to help you. I'll stay with you. I won't let them. She breaks off mid-sentence.stares, stunned! COLE is gone. Disappeared.
RAILLY: Then I said something to him about cooperating and he said he would do that, so I got in the car and started honking the horn. When I got out, he was gone.
LIEUTENANT HALPERIN: You lucked out. For a while we thought you were a body they found down state. A COP enters, hands a photo to LIEUTENANT HALPERIN who studies it.
RAILLY: He wouldn't do something like that he.
LIEUTENANT RALPERIN: ( interrupts, hands her the photo ) This the man he attacked? RAILLY looks at the photo, an 8 x 10 of the FIRST THUG, slumped against the alley wall, obviously dead.
RAILLY: I'd like to be clear about this. That man and the other one were."severely" beating us. James Cole didn't start it. In fact he saved me!
LIEUTENANT RALPERIN: Funny thing, Doctor, maybe you can explain it to me, you being a psychiatrist why do kidnap victims almost always try to tell us about the guys who grabbed 'em and try to make us understand how kind these bastards really were?
RAILLY: ( as if reciting ) It's a normal reaction to a life- threatening situation. ( suddenly animated ) He's sick. He thinks he comes from the future. He's been living in a carefully constructed fantasy world and that world is starting to disintegrate. He needs INT. AIRPORT CONCOURSE/THE DREAM YOUNG COLE stares, eyes wide. He sees the BRUNETTE, cradling the head of the BLONDE MAN as he sprawls on the concourse.
ASTROPHYSICIST: Come on, Cole, cooperate!
GEOLOGIST: Spit it out. you went to the home of a famous virologist.
COLE: ( weakly ) You.don't.exist! You're in my mind.
WAYNE: No I'm in a state of hyper- alertness. I can't sleep.
RAILLY: No I'm in a state of hyper- alertness. I can't sleep.
MARILOU: Did you take the sedative?
RAILLY: I hate those things. They mess my head The old mug shot of COLE appears on the screen and RAILLY remotes the volume up. Along with the kidnapping of the Baltimore woman, James Cole is now also wanted in connection with the brutal slaying of Rodney Wiggins, an ex-convict from. RAILLY goes to the window, pushes aside the drape, and sees. HER POV: ACROSS THE STREET.A COP keeps watch. Do they really expect him to come here? RAILLY returns to the kitchen area where MARILOU is getting the tea things out. And in Fresno, California.
RAILLY: ( glances sadly toward the TV ) He's dead, isn't he that little boy?
WAYNE: He's fine. It was just a "prank" he and his friends pulled.
SCIENTISTS: -found my thrills on Blueberry Hill. Seeing he's awake, SCIENTISTS break off the song and applaud.
SCIENTISTS: Well done, James! Well done! Nice going! Congratulations! Good for you!
BOTANIST: During your "interview," while you were."under the influence," you told us you liked music! COLE, confused, looks around, sees he's in a one-bed windowless room adorned with cheap reproductions of 19th and 20th century The BOTANIST responds to COLE'S obvious disbelief with a friendly smile and the others join in rapid fire, overlapping.
ZOOLOGIST: This isn't the prison, James.
BOTANIST: This is a hospital.
ASTROPHYSICIST: But just until you recover your, uh,. equilibrium.
ENGINEER: You're still a little. disoriented.
GEOLOGIST: Stress! Time travel!
ASTROPHYSICIST: You stood up very well, considering.
GEOLOGIST: Superior work! Superior!
BOTANIST: You connected the Army of the 12 Monkeys to a world famous virologist and his son.
MICROBIOLOGIST: Others will take over now.
ZOOLOGIST: We'll be back on the surface in a matter of months..
GEOLOGIST: We'll retake the planet.
ASTROPHYSICIST: We're very close! Because of you!
ENGINEER: ( unrolling a document ) This is it, James.what you've been working for.
BOTANIST: A full pardon!
MICROBIOLOGIST: You'll be out of here in no time.
ASTROPHYSICIST: Women will want to get to know you.
COLE: I DON'T WANT YOUR "WOMEN," YOU BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL! Unseen until now, two guards, TINY and SCARFACE, suddenly break through the ring of SCIENTISTS, push COLE down, and tighten the loose restraints, already in place, but unnoticed before.
ASTROPHYSICIST: ( sympathetically ) Of course you want to be well, James. And you will be.soon. COLE bursts into hysterical laughter.
COLE: YOU DON'T EXIST, YOU SILLY BOZOS! YOU'RE NOT REAL! HA HA HA! PEOPLE DON'T TRAVEL IN TIME! YOU AREN'T HERE. MADE YOU UP! YOU CAN'T TRICK ME! YOU'RE IN MY MIND! I'M INSANE AND YOU'RE MY INSANITY! INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY CLOSE ON KATHRYN RAILLY, insisting fiercely to someone,
RAILLY: He not only used the word "prank" he said the boy was hiding in a barn. RAILLY's talking to her former boss, DR. OWEN FLETCHER, psychiatrist sitting across from her in his office, tapping his pen.
DR. FLETCHER: He kidnapped you, Kathryn. You saw him murder someone. You knew there was a real possibility he would kill you, too. You were under tremendous emotional stress.
RAILLY: For God sakes, Owen, listen to me he knew about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to die!
DR. FLETCHER: Kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that. You're a rational person. You're a trained psychiatrist. You know the difference between what's real and what's not.
RAILLY: And what we believe is what's accepted as "truth" now, isn't it, Owen? Psychiatry it's the latest religion. And we're the priests we decide what's right and what's wrong we decide who's crazy and who isn't. . I'm in trouble, Owen. I'm losing my faith.
COLE: ( blurting ) I saw you! In 1995! In the real world! You were a bum! You pulled out your teeth. Why would I pull out my teeth, Bob? They don't like that. That's a no-no. And when did you say you saw me? FUCK YOU! Yelling won't get you what you want. You have to be smart to get what you want.
COLE: FUCK YOU! Yelling won't get you what you want. You have to be smart to get what you want.
FUCK YOU!: RASPY VOICE ( o.s. ) Yelling won't get you what you want. You have to be smart to get what you want.
COLE: Oh, yeah? What do I want? You don't know what you want? Sure you do, Bob. You know what you want. COLE, agitated, rocks back and forth. Then.
COLE: Tell me. Tell me what I want. To see the sky and the ocean to be topside breathe the air to be with her. . Isn't that right? Isn't that what you want? Completely shaken, COLE hesitates for a long moment. When he speaks, it comes out of him like air.a whisper.
COLE: INT. RAILLY'S BEDROOM - MORNING RAILLY'S in bed, asleep, having a very bad dream. Suddenly, the bedside phone RINGS. Her eyes snap open. A beat to orient herself. RING. She reaches for the phone.
LIEUTENANT HALPERIN: Dr. Railly? Jim Halperin, Philly P.D.. Sorry to call so early but. CLOSE ON RAILLY, eager, concerned. into the phone,
RAILLY: You found him? Is he all right? CLOSE ON HALPEPIN, noting her reaction with raised eyebrows giving an "I told you so" look to the BLACK PLAINCLOTHES cop across his desk, then continuing into the phone,
LIEUTENANT HALPERIN: Au contraire, Doctor. No sign of your good friend, the kidnapper. However, the plot thickens. I have a ballistic report on my desk that says the bullet you claim you removed from Mr. Cole's thigh is an antique.and all indications are it was fired.sometime prior to 1920. ANGLE ON RAILLY, reacting, stunned. ANGLE ON HALPERIN, continuing soberly now,
LIEUTENANT RALPERIN: So what I was thinking was, maybe if I sent a detective down there to talk with you, you could maybe revise or amplify on the circumstances.. Hello? Hello? Dr. Railly? HALPERIN considers the dead phone, glances at the COP again.
RAILLY: It's an uncropped shot of JOSE being carried on the stretcher in the trenches. And there in the corner with no helmet, no gas mask, and just a bit of bare shoulder showing.it's COLE!!!
ASTROPHYSICIST: The food, the sky, the certain, uh, sexual temptations you haven't become "addicted" have you, Cole? To that "dying" world'
COLE: No, sir! I just want to do my part. To get us back on top.in charge of the planet. And I have the experience, I know who the people are.
BIOLOGIST: He really is the most qualified.
GEOLOGIST: But all that."behavior".
ASTROPHYSICIST: ( to Cole, a little hurt ) You said we weren't "real," Cole.
COLE: Well, sir, I don't think the human mind was built to exist in two different. whatever you call it."dimensions." It's stressful, you said it yourselves, it gets you confused. You don't know what's real and what's not.
MICROBIOLOGIST: But you know what's real now?
COLE: Yes, sir. The SCIENTISTS start to confer openly among themselves
GEOLOGIST: He'd have to bone up, catch up to our research, the latest clues.
ZOOLOGIST: He's proved to be a quick study. The ASTROPHYSICIST fixes COLE with a sharp, penetrating look.
ASTROPHYSICIST: You can't trick us, you know. It wouldn't work.
BIOLOGIST: And why would you want to? It'll be dangerously close to the end.
COLE: I understand. There'd be no point.
ASTROPHYSICIST: We're going to think about it, Cole. Among ourselves. We'll get back to you.
DR. MASON: You have reason to believe that my son may be planning to do what?!!!
RAILLY: Please, I know it sounds insane but.
DR. MASON: ( into the phone ) I'm afraid this doesn't seem very professional to me, in fact it's distressingly unprofessional for some- one who treated my son briefly ( if indeed you actually are who you say you are ) to take a sudden unsolicited interest in his mental health six years later, and to telephone a parent to express opinions that would be inappropriate. ( breaks off, listens, then ) I don't know anything about "Monkey armies", Doctor. Nothing whatsoever. If my son ever was involved in. ( listens, then, ) It would be doubly inappropriate to discuss matters of security with you, Dr. Railly, but if it will put you at ease, neither my son nor any other unauthorized person has access to any potentially dangerous organisms in this laboratory. Thank you for your concern. DR. MASON hangs up angrily and glares. Dr. "Kathryn" Railly????
DR. MASON: The psychiatrist who was kidnapped by that man who broke into my house. She seems to have been suddenly struck by the most preposterous notion about Jeffrey. I attended a lecture once.Apocalyptic We see Dr. Mason's ASSISTANT now. It's DR. PETERS, the red- haired man who insisted to Dr. Railly you didn't have to be insane to think the world was coming to an end. Has she succumbed to her own But DR. MASON is lost in thought, not listening.
DR. MASON: Given the nature of our work, we can't ever be careful enough. I think we should review our security procedures, perhaps upgrade them.
BOTANIST: Let's consider again our current information if the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia on June 28, 1995, that makes us know that.?
COLE: It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
BOTANIST: And it appeared sequentially after that With a quick glance at the panel of SCIENTISTS staring at him from behind the long table, COLE replies like a good pupil,
COLE: San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
BOTANIST: That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
COLE: That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
BOTANIST: And your only goal is.???
COLE: To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
BOTANIST: So that.???
COLE: Uh, so that a vaccine can be developed that will, uh, allow mankind to reclaim the surface of the earth. COLE glances nervously at the suspicious SCIENTISTS as the BOTANIST switches on a slide projector and projects. a magazine photo of wall graffiti: "ATTENTION!!! POLICE ARE
RAILLY: IS ANYBODY IN THERE? HELLO? IS SOMEONE IN THERE? IF YOU'RE IN THERE, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU. INT. FAA STORE JEFFREY, BEN, TEDDY, and two of JEFFREY'S youthful cohorts, SANDY and KWESKIN, wait motionless beside a heap of cardboard cartons as FALE peeks out the front window through a slit between posters.
FALE: It's the kidnap woman the one who was with the guy who tied us up.
BEN: What's she doing?
FALE: She's drawing attention to us, that's what she's doing. . I don't know what you're up to this time, Mason, but you're gonna get us in deep shit!
JEFFREY: Whine, whine, whine. What about walkie talkies? We used to have walkie talkies.
RAILLY: I SAW YOU! I SAW SOMEONE MOVING. I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE! Secret experiments! RAILLY whirls, sees LOUIE, the raspy-voiced toothless derelict.
LOUIE: That's what they do secret weird stuff!
RAILLY: You! I know you! But LOUIE is studying the pictures of the tortured animals now.
LOUIE: Not just on them. Do 'em on people, too down at the shelters. Feed 'em chemicals 'n take pictures of 'em.
RAILLY: Have you seen James Cole? The man.?
LOUIE: They're watchin' you. Takin' pictures. RAILLY follows his look. ANGLE ON AN OLD CHEVY, parked across the street, the PLAINCLOTHES COP slouched at the wheel, pretending to read a newspaper.
RAILLY: The police. I know. Listen, I need to talk to James, but he has to be careful how he contacts me. He mustn't get caught. Do you understand me?
LOUIS: Uh, yeah, sure. Uh.who's James?
RAILLY: He was with me, he spoke to you. Several weeks ago. He said you were from the future.watching him. LOUIS gives her a look that says, "I'm outta here!" But just then, RAILLY spots two TEZNAGE PUNKS surreptitiously "tagging" their way along the street with cans of spray paint. RAILLY stares at the PUNKS.
JEFFREY: You get the bolt cutters?
KWESKIN: One dozen. They're in the van.
FALE: One dozen bolt cutters! Whadda you gonna do with one dozen bolt cutters?
JEFFREY: ( grins ) You really want to know?
FALE: No! Absolutely not. Don't tell me anything.
BEN: Hey! Do you know what she's doing? Everybody freezes, looking toward 3EN, who's peeking outside. Then, except for JEFFREY, they all crowd around BEN to get a look. POV THROUGH SLIT: a glimpse of RAILLY, spray painting the front of the store!
TEDDY: What's it say?
BEN: I can't see it.
JEFFREY: ( erupting )
FALE: ( spinning around ) Your psychiatrist? Did you just say, "your psychiatrist"?
JEFFREY: Ex-psychiatrist! Now, what about flashlights? How many flashlights.?
FALE: That woman is.was.your. psychiatrist? And now she's spray- painting our building?
COLE: RAILLY stops spraying, whips around at the sound of his VOICE.
RAILLY: With a quick glance toward the PLAINCLOTHES COP, RAILLY takes urgent charge of the situation.
RAILLY: James! That's a policeman. Pretend you don't know me. If he sees you.
COLE: ( turning, looking ) No, I want to turn myself in. Where is he? ( placing his hands on his head ) Don't worry it's all okay now. I'm not crazy any more! I mean, I am crazy, mentally divergent, actually, but I know it now and I want you to help me. I want to get well. ANGLE on RAILLY, desperately pulling COLE'S hands off his head as she tries to block the COP'S view of COLE.
RAILLY: James put your hands down and listen to me. Things have changed! ANGLE ON THE PLAINCLOTHES COP, checking the mug shot of COLE on his clipboard, then reaching for his radio mike. ANGLE ON RAILLY, reacting to the COP speaking into his mike: she tosses the spray paint can aside, grabs COLE and tries to pull him along.but COLE isn't moving. He's staring at the front of the FAA Store with disbelief!
RAILLY: James, come on! We have to get out of here! COLE looks from the wall to the can rolling on the sidewalk, then back to the wall where RAILLY has sprayed the huge words:
COLE: I've seen that.before. But RAILLY'S total attention is on their dilemma.
RAILLY: James, trust me. We're in terrible trouble. We have to run. Very confused, COLE lets her drag him along the sidewalk, past ONLOOKERS. She looks crazier than he does. ANGLE ON THE CHEVY, making a sudden, urgent u-turn, almost colliding with a passing car. BRAKES SQUEAL and a HORN BLARES.
BEN: Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her and some other guy I can't see.
FALE: Hey, no problem, it's probably just another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink. This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible schemes, and now who knows what she's painted out there on our wall?
JEFFREY: WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ON You think I told her about the Army of the 12 Monkeys? Impossible! Know why, you pathetically ineffectual and pusillanimous "pretend-friend-to- animals"?! I'll tell you why: because when I had anything to do with her six years ago, there was no such thing I hadn't even thought of it yet!
WALLS?: ( moves to Fale, jabs him with a finger ) You think I told her about the Army of the 12 Monkeys? Impossible! Know why, you pathetically ineffectual and pusillanimous "pretend-friend-to- animals"?! I'll tell you why: because when I had anything to do with her six years ago, there was no such thing I hadn't even thought of it yet!
FALE: ( triumphant ) Then how come she knows what's going on? JEFFREY abruptly switches from rage to good humor, adopting a supercilious smile and a patronizing tone.
JEFFREY: Here's my theory on that. While I was institutionalized, my brain was studied exhaustively in the guise of mental health. I was interrogated, x-rayed, studied thoroughly. Then, everything about me was entered into a computer where they created a model of my mind. They all stare, mesmerized, at the strutting JEFFREY. Is he serious? Is he crazy? Doesn't matter he's charismatic. Then, using the computer model, they generated every thought I could possibly have in the next, say ten years, which they then filtered through a probability matrix to determine everything I was going to do in that period. So you see, she knew I was going to lead the Army of the Twelve Monkeys into the pages of history before it ever even occurred to me. She knows everything I'm ever going to do before I know it myself. How about that? JEFFREY smiles smugly into FALE'S flabbergasted face.
JEFFREY: Now I have to get going do my part. You guys check all this stuff out and load up the van. Make sure you have everything. I'm outta here. JEFFREY exits. The others stare at the door.
FALE: He's seriously crazy you know that.
RAILLY: James! Come on. A confused COLE emerges from the opposite end of the dumpster, bits of lettuce in his hair.
COLE: I don't understand what we're doing.
RAILLY: ( climbing out of the dumpster ) We're avoiding the police until I can..talk to you.
COLE: ( climbing out after her ) You mean, treat me? Cure me? Kathryn, those words on the wall I've seen them before. I.I.dreamed them. But she's not listening. She's peeking out the alley entrance. RAILLY'S POV: across the street is a run-down skid row hotel,
DESK CLERK: Twenty five bucks an hour.
RAILLY: An hour?!
DESK CLERK: You want quarter hours, go someplace else.
RAILLY: ( catches on, pulls out her last bills ) Here's ninety eight. For the night. Deal? The DESK CLERK squints warily at this turn of events. Then, he turns, gets a key, turns back and hands it to her.
DESK CLERK: Forty four. Fourth floor, turn right. Elevator's busted. RAILLY turns, COLE follows, and they walk quickly to the stairs passing the stares of gloomy RESIDENTS sitting on torn sofas chairs in front of an old TV with hideous color. ANGLE ON THE DESK CLERK, watching RAILLY and COLE climb stairs. As they disappear from view, he picks up the phone, punches a number, speaks into the phone.
DESK CLERK: Tommy? This is Charlie at the Globe. You know if Wallace has a new girl? Sort of a rookie type? Blonde?
RAILLY: Okay.you were standing there looking at the moon.you were eating grass. then what?
COLE: I thought I was in.prison again.
RAILLY: Just like that? You were in prison?
COLE: No, not really. It's.it's in my mind. Like you said.
RAILLY: You disappeared! One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?
COLE: I don't know I don't remember.
RAILLY: The boy in the well. How did you know that was just a hoax?
COLE: It was? I didn't.know.
RAILLY: James, you said he was hiding in the barn.
COLE: I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid. Where a boy.
RAILLY: IT WASN'T A TV SHOW! IT WAS REAL! COLE looks at her. She's really upset.
COLE: Well, maybe that kid saw the same TV show and copied it. Listen, you were right, it's all in my head. I'm mentally ill, I imagine all that stuff. I know they're not real, I can trick them, make them do what I want. I just worked on them in my head and I got back here. I can get better. I can stay here. RAILLY pulls a photo from her purse, shows it to COLE. It's the uncropped picture from her book, the photo of JOSE in WWI with a fuzzy image of COLE on the edge of the frame,
RAILLY: What does this mean to you?
COLE: .I had a dream about.something like that.
RAILLY: You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James! How did it get there?
COLE: You said I had delusions that I created a world you said you could explain everything.
RAILLY: Well, I can't. . I mean.I'm trying to. I can't believe that everything we do or say has already happened, that we can't change what's going to happen, that I'm one of the three billion people who are going to die.soon. COLE stands, moves close to her.
COLE: I want to be here. In this time. With you. I want to become.become a whole person. I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.
RAILLY: ( sudden hopeful idea! ) James.do you remember.six years ago.you had a phone number! You tried to call and. WHAM! The door flies open, kicked violently, the flimsy lock not holding. A menacing figure stands in the doorway. WALLACE. A wiry biker-type with jail house tattoos and mean eyes. COLE and RAILLY are too stunned to say anything as WALLACE looks them over coldly, insolently, then advances on RAILLY.
WALLACE: This is my territory, bitch!
COLE: ( confused, turns to Railly ) Is this real or is this one of my This is definitely real: ( to Wallace ) Excuse me, I think we have a little misunderstanding here. WALLACE smashes RAILLY in the face. She flies back against the wall and onto the floor as WALLACE spins around to COLE who is stepping toward him, but WALLACE is now holding a knife
RAILLY: This is definitely real: Excuse me, I think we have a little misunderstanding here. WALLACE smashes RAILLY in the face. She flies back against the wall and onto the floor as WALLACE spins around to COLE who is stepping toward him, but WALLACE is now holding a knife
WALLACE: What're you some kind of tough guy? You wanna be a hero? You gonna try and mess with me? Come on. A beat. COLE puts his hands up placatingly as he backs around WALLACE and moves to RAILLY, whose eye is already swelling.
WALLACE: Now that's a smart boy. But you, honey, you think you can go 'round me and peddle your fancy ass in this part of town, you bet your life we got what I would call a major goddamn RAILLY reaches a hand up to COLE for assistance, but, he grabs her purse instead, swings it around, SMASHES WALLACE in the face with it, then grabs the pimp's arm and SNAPS it like it was a twig! The knife clatters to the floor as WALLACE yelps in pain and COLE slams him to the floor, straddles his chest, retrieves the near-by knife, and presses it sharply against WALLACE'S neck.
RAILLY: JAMES DON'T! COLE hesitates.
WALLACE: ( eyes bulging ) You.heard.her. Don't do it, man.
RAILLY: ( gets up, looks around ) Put him in the closet, . But get his money first.
COLE: ( amazed ) You want me to rob him?
RAILLY: I.I.We need cash, James. A shadow. RAILLY turns toward the door and glimpses a FACE disappearing, then hears SHOUTS from the hallway. They're killing him! Call the cops. Being very careful not to move his neck, WALLACE reaches into his pocket and produces a thick roll of bills, which RAILLY grabs.
WALLACE: You two are crazy. I got friends. You put me in a closet, they're gonna be really pissed. COLE moves off Wallace and, keeping the knife close, yanks him to his teeth while RAILLY hurries to the window and looks out. HER POV: A fire escape leads down into an alley. RAILLY turns just in time to see COLE shove WALLACE into the bathroom, follow him in, slam the door behind them, and LOCK it.
RAILLY: James, no!
WALLACE: I have friends, man if you cut me. WALLACE breaks off, bug-eyed, reacting to something we don't see!
WALLACE: What.the.fuck..are you doing???
RAILLY: Oh, my God, James. Did you kill him? COLE shakes his head "no" as blood oozes from his mouth.
COLE: Just.just in case. In case I'm not That's how they find us. By our teeth. I don't want them to find me. Ever. I don't want to go back. RAILLY's astonishment turns to emotion as it dawns on her the choice he's made. Given up the future ( if it exists, and it's looking like it does )! Risking his life to be with her! For this brief time! She's overwhelmed, lips trembling, tears welling in her eyes. But just then, the SOUNDS of SHOUTS and feet THUNDERING up the stairs snap her back to reality.
RAILLY: Push it tight!
PLAINCLOTHES COP: POLICE! THROW YOUR WEAPONS OUT AND COME OUTTA THERE! No response.
RAILLY: Wait here. I'm going to try that phone number. Let's hope it's nothing! Dazed by his experience and the flow of SHOPPERS, COLE watches her hurry to a pay phone twenty yards away, his view of her made intermittent by PEDESTRIANS streaming past him, their FACES looming frighteningly close. A BUSINESSMAN jostles COLE, forcing him back against the display window. Turning, he faces the angry jaws of a BEAR only inches away Recovering from a jolt of terror, COLE realizes the BEAR is a life-size toy in the display window. Relieved, he looks back at RAILLY. COLE'S POV: RAILLY, well out of earshot, speaking earnestly into the phone. ANGLE ON COLE, startled, as a BUSINESSMAN, mistaking him for a panhandler, shoves a dollar into his hand. Confused, COLE stares at the dollar, then turns to say something to the retreating BUSINESSMAN, but just then he sees RAILLY rushing toward him, eyes sparkling with happiness, LAUGHING, ebullient.
RAILLY: James! James! It's okay. We're insane! We're crazy! COLE doesn't know how to respond, but a PASSERBY gives them a look.
RAILLY: It's a Carpet Cleaning Company.
COLE: A Carpet Cleaning Company?
RAILLY: ( laughing ) No superiors! No scientists. No people from the future. It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company. They have voice mail you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet You. you left them a message?
COLE: You. you left them a message?
RAILLY: ( impishly ) I couldn't resist. I was so relieved. Wait'll they hear this nutty woman telling them.they better watch out for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys. Looking at her laughing face, COLE is struck with horror as he realizes the truth! He starts to recite.
COLE: "The Army of the Twelve Monkeys they're the ones who are going to do it. I can't do anything more. The police are watching me." Now she's stunned. She glances back and sees the phone booth twenty yards away.
RAILLY: You. you couldn't have heard me.
COLE: They got your message, Kathryn. They played it for me. It was a bad recording.distorted. I didn't recognize your voice. RAILLY'S eyes fill with horror as she grasps the meaning. ANGLE ON A UNIFORMED COP, staring out the window of a POLICE CRUISER as it inches along in the bumper to bumper traffic. Noticing something, he reaches for his radio. ANGLE ON RAILLY, spotting the CRUISER, grabbing COLE, pulling him into the CROWD.
RAILLY: Come on.
RAILLY: And this. Anything else? But COLE'S not here. He's a short distance away.staring. COLE'S POV: aisle after aisle of eager shoppers and a bounty of brand new consumer goods. ANGLE ON COLE, remembering another department store, dark and full of moldering merchandise. ANGLE ON RAILLY, turning again to the CLERK.
RAILLY: I guess that's it.
CLERK: Shall I put this on your account, Ma'am?
RAILLY: ( producing Wallace's roll of bills ) No I'll pay cash. The CLERK stares at the huge roll of bills!
RAILLY: What floor are the wigs on, please?
KWESKIN: So then he goes into this incredible riff about how his shrink, like, replicated his brain while he was in the nut house. Turned it into a computer.
WELLER: And Fale believed it?
KWESKIN: Oh, you know Fale! He's like, "If you guys get nailed and I'm sure you will I never saw you before in nay life!" LAUGHTER from all of them. Then, there's a sharp, rhythmic series of RAPS on the side door, a signal. POPE quickly slides the door open. It's JEFFREY.grinning. Three other activists, GOINES, ICHIOKA, and BRUHNS, stagger out of the darkness behind JEFFREY, lugging a huge, squirming GARBAGE BAG. The van occupants react with murmurs of "Awwwwwright" and "Far out", then they help maneuver the writhing bag into the van. Then, JEFFREY and the other three scramble in, too.
JEFFREY: Let's do it!
JEFFREY: Okay, that's Stage One. In Stage Two, Monkey Four is over here. A loud GROAN from the bag distracts the others.
GOINES: What's the harm in opening the bag? His eyes are taped.
SANDY: Yeah, it's cruel leaving him like that.
JEFFREY: Ah, but cruelty is his specialty.
ICHIOKA: So why should we be like him? Shrugging cheerfully, JEFFREY tears open the garbage bag revealing DR. MASON, trussed up, duct tape covering his eyes and mouth.
JEFFREY: Want the full effect? Grinning wickedly, JEFFREY rips the tape from his father's mouth.
DR. MASON: Jeffrey? I know it's you, Jeffrey. I recognize your voice. JEFFREY puts his finger to his lips, silencing everyone.
DR. MASON: JEFFREY??? . Very well. You're out of your mind, Jeffrey. I know all about your insane plan. That woman your psychiatrist she told me. JEFFREY raises his eyebrows. This he hadn't expected.
DR. MASON: I didn't believe her it seemed too crazy even for you. But, just in case, I took steps to make sure you couldn't do it. I took myself out of the loop! I don't have the code any more. I don't have access to the virus. So, go ahead torture me, but you can't extract anything of use to yourself. The ACTIVISTS are all exchanging puzzled looks.
JEFFREY: DR. MASON ( spins his head toward Jeffrey ) She knew about it, Jeffrey. She knew you were going to try this.
DR. MASON: ( spins his head toward Jeffrey ) She knew about it, Jeffrey. She knew you were going to try this.
JEFFREY: What virus are we talking about, Dad?
DR. MASON: You're insane, Jeffrey.
JEFFREY: You "develop" viruses and you're calling me insane? Typical. What does this virus attack? Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter. Have I ever "developed" a virus? Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements? Wow! And I'm crazy!
DR. MASON: Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly are you going to do? I don't have to tell you I'm afraid.
JEFFREY: THIS IS A FUCKING EXPERIMENT! YOU'RE OUR HELPLESS LITTLE TEST ANIMAL, DADDY. GOT THAT? NOW WHAT FUCKING VIRUS HAVE YOU COME UP WITH, YOU DEMENTED FUCKING MANIAC? INT. MOVIE SCREEN/THEATER - NIGHT Spooky BERNARD HERRMAN MUSIC, giant redwoods looming skyward. It's DAYTIME in Muir Woods. SCOTTY ( JAMES STEWART ) AND MADELINE ( KIM NOVAK ) walk toward a display of a cross cut section of a redwood tree. We're watching Hitchcock's VERTIGO. Here's a cross section of one of the old trees that's been cut down. They look at the lines of the tree marked with cards that say,
FUCKING MANIAC?: INT. MOVIE SCREEN/THEATER - NIGHT Spooky BERNARD HERRMAN MUSIC, giant redwoods looming skyward. It's DAYTIME in Muir Woods. SCOTTY ( JAMES STEWART ) AND MADELINE ( KIM NOVAK ) walk toward a display of a cross cut section of a redwood tree. We're watching Hitchcock's VERTIGO. They look at the lines of the tree marked with cards that say,
RAILLY: Here, let me help you. The theater is briefly illuminated by a very bright scene on the screen, revealing enough of COLE and RAILLY for us to see she's doing something to his upper lip while he tries to watch the movie.
COLE: I think I've seen this movie before. When I was a kid. It was on TV.
RAILLY: ( fussing with his upper lip ) Shh don't talk. Hold still.
COLE: ( moving his head to see the film ) I have seen it, but I don't remember this part. Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past. The movie never changes it can't change but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different you notice different things.
RAILLY: If we can't change anything.because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
COLE: Flowers! What flowers? From the darkness, a MOVIE PATRON makes a SSSSHHHHH shound.
RAILLY: ( whispering ) It's an expression. Here. She's pulling something from a shopping bag at her feet, placing it on COLE'S head, adjusting it.
COLE: Why are we doing this?
RAILLY: So we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music. So we can appreciate what we have while we have it. Forgive me, psychiatrists don't cry. There are tears in her eyes. They discomfit COLE.
COLE: But maybe I'm wrong. Maybe you're wrong. Maybe we're both crazy.
RAILLY: In a few weeks, it will have started or it won't. If there are still baseball games and traffic jams, armed robberies and boring TV shows we'll be so happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police.
SHADOWY MOVIEGOER: ( whispers ) Where can we hide for a few weeks? ANGLE ON THE SCREEN, where SCOTTY and MADELINE are in the foreground, the OCEAN behind them.
SHHHHHHH: ( whispers ) Where can we hide for a few weeks? ANGLE ON THE SCREEN, where SCOTTY and MADELINE are in the foreground, the OCEAN behind them.
COLE: ( whispers ) Where can we hide for a few weeks? ANGLE ON THE SCREEN, where SCOTTY and MADELINE are in the foreground, the OCEAN behind them.
RAILLY: You said you'd never seen the ocean.
COLE: INT. THEATER LOBBY A lobby poster boasts "Classics 24 Hours A Day" and "Hitchcock Festival". PANNING OFF the poster, passing a SNORING USHER, dead to the world in an old velvet chair, WE DISCOVER a BRUNETTE in a tight dress, just hanging up the lobby pay phone. Turning, she reveals heavy make-up, gaudy costume jewelry, and sun glasses. She's the BRUNETTE in COLE'S DREAM! Crossing the lobby toward the auditorium, it's a pleasure to watch her nice body undulate in the tight dress. Just then, the auditorium doors burst open and a BLONDE MAN in a Hawaiian shirt appears, the man from COLE'S DREAM, except this man's moustache is fixed firmly on his upper lip. The BLONDE MAN stops, stunned at the sight of the BRUNETTE.
BRUNETTE: We're booked on a 9:30 flight to Key West. The Brunette is RAILLY, no longer the frazzled professional, revealed now by her disguise as a sexy babe. The Blonde Man is COLE! He's confused.
COLE: You were in my dream just now. I didn't recognize you.
RAILLY: Well, you look pretty different, too.
COLE: I mean in my dream I didn't realize it was you. Then.I woke up and I.I thought you were gone.
RAILLY: ( studies him seriously ) I remember you.like this. I feel I've known you before. I feel I've always known you. Their eyes lock. Suddenly, she backs up, gently maneuvering him with her, past the sleeping USHER, to and through an unlocked, unmarked door, then closing it behind them.
RAILLY: Nine thirty
WOMAN CABBIE: Might be tight.
RAILLY: ( startled, checks her watch ) Tight? My watch says 7:30.
WOMAN CABBIE: On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.
RAILLY: What? What did you say?
WOMAN CABBIE: Twelve Monkeys, honey. Guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning. COLE and RAILLY exchange a quick look.
WOMAN CABBIE: Bunch a weirdoes let all the animals outta the zoo last night. Then they locked up this big shot scientist in one of the cages. Scientist's own kid was one a the ones did it! RAILLY and COLE stare at the cabbie, stunned. Now they got animals all over the place. Buncha zebras shut down the thruway 'bout an hour ago and some kinda thing called an "e-mu" it's got traffic blocked for miles over on 22. Flabbergasted, RAILLY'S eyes suddenly fill with hope.
RAILLY: That's what they were up to! Freeing On the walls they meant the animals when they said, "We did it."
COLE: On the walls they meant the animals when they said, "We did it."
WOMAN CABBIE: You can hear it on the radio all the As the WOMAN CAEBIE switches on the RADIO, RA:LLY points and COLE follows her look. COLE'S POV: two CHEETAHS, sleek and magnificent against the cityscape, streaking past the cab at ninety mph! In the meantime, numerous animal rights activists have joined the chorus condemning what they're calling the "loose canon" activities of Jeffrey Mason and his Army of the Twelve Can these fools seriously believe that releasing a captive animal into an urban environment is being compassionate to the animal? It's mindlessly cruel, almost as indefensible as holding the animal in captivity in the first place. RAILLY and COLE are watching FLAMINGOS cross the sky against a backdrop of skyscrapers in silhouette.
RAILLY: Maybe it's going to be okay.
DETECTIVE: Tell your people if they spot either one of them, not to try and apprehend then. They should notify us and. ANGLE ON RAILLY AND COLE, thirty yards away, entering the terminal.
P.A. SYSTEM: Flight 531 for Chicago is now ready for boarding at Gate Seventeen. ANGLE ON COLE, reacting to the P.A., stopping, seeing the bustling airport lobby.
COLE: I know this place! . This is my dream.
RAILLY: Airports all look the same. Maybe James! Your moustache! It's slipping. But COLE isn't listening. He's looking around, mesmerized.
COLE: It's not just my dream. I was actually here! I remember now. My parents brought me to meet my uncle. About a week or two before.before.before everybody started dying. RAILLY glances around nervously. RAILLY'S POV: two UNIFORMED POLICEMEN, strolling through the lobby, their eyes scanning the faces of TRAVELERS. ANGLE ON RAILLY, pulling a small tube from her purse.
RAILLY: They may be looking for us, James. Use this. You can fix it in the Men's Room.
COLE: ( confounded ) I was here.as a kid. I think you were here, too. But you.looked just like you look now.
RAILLY: ( getting desperate ) James, if we're identified, they're going to send us someplace.but not to Key West!
COLE: ( snaps out of it, hand to moustache ) Right! You're right. I have to fix this.
RAILLY: ( indicating a sign ) I'll get the tickets and meet you. in the Gift Shop. COLE follows her look, nods, then heads for the Men's Room as RAILLY, in sun glasses, gaudy outfit, high heels, starts clip clopping toward the ticket counter, her ass attracting admiring INT. TELEPHONES/LOBBY - DAY BUSINESS TRAVELERS huddle over pay phones, talking earnestly, as COLE walks past on his way to the Men's Room. Seeing an unoccupied phone, COLE hesitates, considers it. Coming to a decision, he reaches into his pocket, pulls out some change.
RAILLY: Judy Simmons. I have reservations for Key West.
COLE: Listen, I don't know whether you're there or not. Maybe you just clean carpets. If you do, you're lucky you're gonna live a long, happy life. But if you other guys exist and you're picking this up forget about the Army of The Twelve Monkeys they didn't do it. It was a mistake' Someone else did it. The Army of The Twelve Monkeys are just dumb kids playing revolutionaries. It was someone else! COLE looks around nervously, catches a BUSINESSMAN at the next phone looking away quickly. COLE touches his loose moustache as he averts his face and speaks into the phone in an urgent whisper.
COLE: I've done my job. I did what you wanted. Good luck. I'm not coming back! COLE hangs up the phone, looks around, catches a few stares. Averting his face, he heads for the Men's Room.
TICKET AGENT: Don't see a lot of this. cash.
RAILLY: It's.a long story.
TICKET AGENT: ( smiles, hands over the tickets ) They'll begin boarding in about twenty minutes. Have a nice flight, Mrs. Simmons. Turning to go, RAILLY fumbles the tickets while trying to put them in her purse and they flutter to the floor. As she kneels to retrieve them, WE SEE the long line of waiting TRAVELERS from the waist down. WE SEE a familiar Chicago Bulls Sports Bag resting on the floor beside sneakers and gaudy baggy pants. we've seen this outfit before.in COLE'S dream.on MR. PONYTAIL!
COLE: Leave me alone! I made a report. I didn't have to do that. Point of fact you don't belong here. It's not permitted to let you stay. A toilet FLUSHES in the "occupied" stall. COLE'S answer is loud and defiant.
COLE: This is the present. This is not the past. This is not the future. This is right now! A PLUMP BUSINESSMAN emerges from the "occupied" stall, gives COLE a wary look and a wide berth as he heads for a sink.
COLE: I'm staying here! You got that? You can't stop me!
PLUMP MAN: ( high pitched voice ) Anything you say, chief. It's none of my business. COLE looks dismayed. This guy couldn't be "THE VOICE"! And there are no feet showing under the other stalls. Did he imagine it?
TICKET AGENT: Woooo-eeee. San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, Peking! That's some trip you're taking, sir, All in one week! Have a good one, sir.
TICKET AGENT: ( handing over the tickets ) Have a good one, sir.
COLE: Pulling out the tooth, man, that was nuts! Here, take this. JOSE tries to slip COLE a 9mm pistol. Astonished, COLE resists!
JOSE: Pulling out the tooth, man, that was nuts! Here, take this. JOSE tries to slip COLE a 9mm pistol. Astonished, COLE resists!
COLE: What? What for? Are you crazy? Frustrated, JOSE conceals the gun but keeps a grip on COLE'S arm.
JOSE: Me? Are you kiddin? You're the one! You were a hero, man. They gave you a pardon! And whadda you do? You come back and fuck with your teeth! Wow!
COLE: How did you find me?
JOSE: The phone call, man. The phone call.
COLE: The call I just made? Five minutes ago?
JOSE: Hey, five minutes ago, thirty years ago! Yes, that phone call. I been in training for this a couple a months now ever since I got back from that. "weird" war we were in. You remember that? Here, take it, man! You could still be a hero if you'd cooperate!
DR. PETERS: Isn't it obvious that "Chicken Little" represents the sane vision and that Homo Sapiens' motto, "Let's go shopping!" is the cry of the true lunatic?
RAILLY: Oh, my God!
JOSE: Coma on, Cole, don't be an asshole. Look, I got orders, man! You know what I'm sposed to do if you don't go along? I'm sposed to shoot the lady! You got that? They said, "If Cole don't obey this time, Garcia, you gotta shoot his COLE stops in his tracks, blown away, too stunned to speak.
JOSE: I got no choice, man. These are my orders. Just take it, okay? COLE accepts the gun this time, resigned now. They've got him.
COLE: This part isn't about the virus, is it?
JOSE: Hey, man.
COLE: It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
JOSE: They gave you a pardon, man. Whatdaya Who am I supposed to shoot? Just then, RAILLY rushes up to COLE, not even noticing JOSE.
COLE: Who am I supposed to shoot? Just then, RAILLY rushes up to COLE, not even noticing JOSE.
RAILLY: James! Thank God! I thought you'd disappeared. Listen, I think I know who it is! I saw him! It's Dr. Mason's assistant. An apocalypse nut! The next flight to San Francisco leaves from Gate 38. If he's there, it has to be him. JOSE, having heard this, steps back into the crowd as RAILLY grabs COLE and pulls him toward the Security Check Points.
COLE: I love you, Kathryn. Remember that. She doesn't hear him or see the look of doom in his eyes.
RAILLY: Maybe we can stop him. Maybe we can actually do something.
SECURITY OFFICER: Excuse me, sir. Would you mind letting me have a look at the contents of your bag? ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, coming through the magnetic arch, reacting.
DR. PETERS: Me? Oh, yes, of course. My samples. I have the appropriate papers.
RAILLY: Oh, God, we don't have time for this. ANGLE ON THE SECURITY CHECK POINT, where DR. PETERS unpacks his Bulls bag, pulls out six metal cylinders along with a change of clothes and a Walkman.
DR. PETERS: Biological samples. I have the paperwork right here. DR. PETERS produces a sheaf of official papers while the SECURITY OFFICER examines one of the tubes, turning it over in his hands.
SECURITY OFFICER: I'm going to have to ask you to open this, sir.
DR. PETERS: Open it? Of course. DR. PETERS takes the metal cylinder and starts opening it. There's a SOUND of VOICES RAISED behind them. DR. PETERS pays no attention, but the SECURITY OFFICER turns toward the NOISE. SECURITY OFFICER'S POV: RAILLY, trying to explain something to a
DR. PETERS: Here! You see? Biological! Check the papers it's all proper. I have a It's empty! Indeed, it looks like a sealed clear glass tube with nothing in it.
SECURITY OFFICER: It's empty! Indeed, it looks like a sealed clear glass tube with nothing in it.
DR. PETERS: Well, yes, to be sure, it looks empty! But I assure you, it's not. ANGLE ON RAILLY, at the end of the line, arguing with the SECOND
RAILLY: Please listen to me this is very urgent!
TRAVELER: We're all in a hurry, lady. What's so special about you? ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, producing the glass tubes from the other metal cylinders as the SECURITY OFFICER examines the papers.
DR. PETERS: You see! Also invisible to the naked eye. A beat. OR. PETERS grins suddenly, opens one of the glass tubes, and waves it under the SECURITY OFFICER'S nose!
DR. PETERS: It doesn't even have an odor. The SECURITY OFFICER glances up, sees what DR. PETERS is doing, and smiles as he hands the papers back to the scientist.
SECURITY OFFICER: That's not necessary, sir. Here you go. Thanks for your cooperation. Have a good flight. Hastily, DR. PETERS snatches up all the tubes and cylinders and shoves them back into his gym bag. ANGLE ON RAILLY, raging as the SECOND SECURITY OFFICER jabs her with his finger.
COLE: Get your hands off her! The SECOND SECURITY OFFICER stiffens for trouble. ANGLE ON THE DETECTIVES, watching the fuss, ready to get involved. Suddenly, the FIRST DETECTIVE frowns. FIRST DETECTIVE9S POV: COLE'S moustache is slipping. COLE senses it, reaches up to touch it, catches the DETECTIVE'S look. For half a second their eyes meet, then COLE looks away. ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, hurrying away.
COLE: I said, get your hands off her. She's not a criminal. She's a doctor.a RAILLY looks alarmed at that. ANGLE ON THE DETECTIVES, coming this way. The FIRST DETECTIVE has the photos in his hand. ANGLE OW DR. PETERS, bagging his jockey shorts, then starting hastily down the windowed concourse toward the gates. ANGLE ON RAZZLY, suddenly spotting DR. PETERS!
RAILLY: THERE HE IS! HE'S CARRYING A DEADLY VIRUS! STOP HIM! ANGLE ON COLE, following RAILLY'S look, seeing MR. PONYTAIL, THE
FIRST DETECTIVE: ( raising his badge ) Police Officers. Would you step over here, please. ANGLE ON COLE, spotting something behind the DETECTIVES! COLE'S POV: SCARFACE, dressed like a "businessman"! He gives COLE a cold look. A beat. COLE lunges at the SECOND DETECTIVE, knocking him off balance, then sprints toward the magnetic arch and through it. The ALARM goes off!!!! The FIRST SECURITY OFFICER tries to stop COLE, but COLE knocks him aside like a rag doll. ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, fifty yards up the concourse, glancing back. ANGLE ON COLE, pulling his pistol.
FIRST DETECTIVE: STOP OR I'LL SHOOT! ANGLE ON COLE, gun in hand, sprinting along the concourse toward DR. PETERS as frightened TRAVELERS SCREAM and dive for cover. ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, standing at a concourse window, watching a plane land, flanked by his parents whose faces we don't see.
DR. PETERS: WATCH IT! ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, wide eyed, watching. YOUNG COLE'S POV: a BLONDE MAN. dashing up the concourse, his moustache slipping over his lip, a pistol in his hand. YOUNG COLE'S POV: the FIRST DETECTIVE aims, looking for a clear shot in the crowded passageway. YOUNG COLE'S POV: a BRUNETTE in flashy clothes, gaudy earrings, high heels, and sun glasses SCREAMS.

N0OOOOO0O!!!!!!: YOUNG COLE'S POV: the FIRST DETECTIVE, firing! CRACK! YOUNG COLE'S POV: the BLONDE MAN, shuddering, staggering, falling. ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, stunned, as his PARENTS try to shield him. Mesmerized, YOUNG COLE watches the BRUNETTE rush to the BLONDE MAN, kneel beside him, minister to his bloody wound. YOUNG COLE'S POV: the BLONDE MAN, fatalistically reaching up and tenderly touching the BRUNETTE'S cheek, touching her tears.
DR. PETERS: I think you're right. sir. I think you've hit the nail on the head. DR. PETERS' POV: the FELLOW TRAVELER, a silver haired gentleman in a business suit, offering his hand congenially. DR. PETERS doesn't know who this man is, but we do. It's the ASTROPHYSICIST!
ASTROPHYSICIST: Jones is my name. I'm in insurance.
