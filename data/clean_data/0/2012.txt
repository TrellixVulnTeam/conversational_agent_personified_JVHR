ADRIAN: But you were doing a good job.
LAURA: Sure, if your name's Da Vinci or Picasso. But if you're some young talent in Podunk, Texas, sorry you're not famous enough. People like you and Anheuser and my father - you think you can play God.
ADRIAN: You know what your father believed. That nature will choose itself from That's bullshit and you know it. It's the fittest, the richest and the strongest that survive.
LAURA: That's bullshit and you know it. It's the fittest, the richest and the strongest that survive.
ADRIAN: That's not true.
LAURA: Zero. What's your point?
ADRIAN: It's called `Farewell Atlantis' and it's a fantastic read. It's part of our legacy now.
ADRIAN: What if I tried to sort some of this mess out? I need to know you can forgive me.
LAURA: I need to know that too, Adrian.
ADRIAN: One more thing. Your father told me you were the most precious thing to him in the whole world. You are to me too.
