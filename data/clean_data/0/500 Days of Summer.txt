NARRATOR: This is a story of boy meets girl.
NARRATOR: The boy, Tom Hansen of Margate, New Jersey, grew up believing that he'd never truly be happy until the day he met his. "soulmate."
NARRATOR: This belief stemmed from early exposure to sad British pop music and a total misreading of the movie, "The Graduate."
NARRATOR: The girl, Summer Finn of Shinnecock, Michigan, did not share this belief.
NARRATOR: Since the disintegration of her parents' marriage, she'd only loved two things. The first was her long blonde hair.
NARRATOR: The second was how easily she could cut it off. And feel nothing.
NARRATOR: Tom meets Summer on January 8th in a San Francisco office building. In an instant, he will know she's the one he's been looking for.
NARRATOR: This is a story of boy meets girl.
NARRATOR: You should know up front, this is not a love story.
PAUL: I didn't know who else to call.
GIRL: You did the right thing. Where is
GIRL: Tom freezes.
TOM: Rachel? What are you doing here?
TOM: Help me how?
RACHEL: First, put down the plate.
RACHEL: Now come here and sit down.
RACHEL: The key is not to panic.
TOM: I think I'm gonna be sick.
RACHEL: Drink this.
MCKENZIE: What is that?
RACHEL: ( grimacing at the taste )
TOM: ( grimacing at the taste )
TOM: Does Mom know you're here? It's gotta be past 10.
RACHEL: Don't worry about it. Start from the beginning. Tell us what
TOM: I thought it was a great day.
RACHEL: And then what happened?
TOM: ( to WAITRESS ) Um.you know what.let's go crazy, I'll have BOTH. ( to Summer ) God, I love eating pancakes at night. It's like the greatest thing ever. How great is this?
SUMMER: I think we should stop seeing each Just like that?
RACHEL: Just like that?
TOM: Just like that.
PAUL: Did she say why?
SUMMER: This thing. This whatever it is. You and me. Do you think this is I don't know. Who cares about normal?! I'm happy. Aren't you You're happy?
TOM: I don't know. Who cares about normal?! I'm happy. Aren't you You're happy?
SUMMER: You're happy?
TOM: You're not?
SUMMER: All we do is argue!
TOM: That is such a lie!
RACHEL: Maybe she was just in a bad mood.
PAUL: A hormonal thing.
RACHEL: ( to Rachel ) What do you know about PMS?
P.M.S.?: ( to Rachel ) What do you know about PMS?
TOM: ( to Rachel ) What do you know about PMS?
RACHEL: More than you.
TOM: Oh my god.
MCKENZIE: Please continue.
SUMMER: This can't be a total surprise. I mean, we've been like Sid and Nancy for months.
TOM: Summer, Sid stabbed Nancy seven times with a kitchen knife. We've had some disagreements but I hardly think I'm Sid Vicious.
SUMMER: No. I'm Sid.
TOM: ( BEAT ) So I'm Nancy?!
SUMMER: Let's just eat and we'll talk about it after. I'm starving.
SUMMER: ( mouth full ) Mmm, you're so right. These are

TOM: ( BEAT ) I'm gonna throw up.
MCKENZIE: Or that.
RACHEL: Tom drinks more vodka.
MCKENZIE: Come on Hansen. You'll be ok. You're the best guy I know. You'll find someone.
PAUL: You know what they say.there's plenty other fish in the sea.
TOM: Sure they do. They say that.
PAUL: Sure they do. They say that.
TOM: Well they're wrong. It's not true. I've fished in that sea. I've jumped in and swam in that sea! I'm fucking Aquaman! Sorry. What I mean is. there are no other fish. This was my fish.
TOM: I'm in love with Summer.
PAUL: ( BEAT ) For real?
TOM: For real, Paul. I'm madly in love with that girl.
PAUL: Oh shit.
MCKENZIE: Now I know this may be a little risque.but if New Hampshire Greetings wants the jump on those conservative, right-wing neo-Nazis at Hallmark, maybe playing it safe is the wrong approach. The nuclear family is dead and we need a new holiday to recognize that.
MCKENZIE: May 21st. Other Mother's Day.
VANCE: Hmmm. That's an intriguing idea McKenzie. Along with Grossman's "Magellan Day" I'd say we've got some potential here. What do you think Hansen? Could you write up some prototypes for these?
SUMMER: Excuse me, Mr. Vance? There's a call for you on line 3.
VANCE: ( to the table ) Everyone this is Summer, my new assistant. Summer just moved here Right. Michigan. Well, Summer, everyone. Everyone, Summer. Excuse me, I have to take this.

MCKENZIE: Dude. I hear she's a bitch from Patel tried to talk to her in the copy room. She was totally not having it.
TOM: ( DISAPPOINTED ) Patel tried to talk to her in the copy room. She was totally not having it.
MCKENZIE: Patel tried to talk to her in the copy room. She was totally not having it.
TOM: Maybe she was just in a hurry.
MCKENZIE: And maybe she's some uppity, better than everyone, superskank.
TOM: I know. She's pretty hot.
MCKENZIE: I know. She's pretty hot.
TOM: That makes me so mad! Why is it pretty girls always think they can treat people like crap and get away with it?
MCKENZIE: Like, just cause she has high cheekbones and soft skin.
TOM: Like, just cause she has high cheekbones and soft skin.
MCKENZIE: .and really good teeth.
TOM: And maybe the world's most perfect breasts.Just cause of that stuff, she can walk around like she's center of the universe?
MCKENZIE: ( as explanation ) Ugh. You know what? Screw her! We haven't even met and I can't stand her already.
TOM: Ugh. You know what? Screw her! We haven't even met and I can't stand her already.
SUMMER: The Smiths.

SUMMER: The city or the firm?
TOM: Both. Either.
SUMMER: I'm happy. Still getting situated. How long have you worked here?
TOM: Oh, you know, 4, 5. years.
SUMMER: Really? Jesus. Did you always want to write greeting cards?
TOM: Are you nuts? I don't even want to do it now.
SUMMER: What is it you want to do?
TOM: I studied to be an architect That's so cool! What happened?
SUMMER: That's so cool! What happened?
TOM: Eh, you know. Same old story. Moved to the city to work for a company. Company went under. Needed a job. My friend worked here. Got me this.

TOM: And it turns out she's read every Graham Greene novel ever published. Her desk is lined with Magritte posters and Edward Hopper.
RACHEL: Your favorites.
TOM: We're so compatible it's insane! Seriously! It doesn't make sense! She's not like I thought at all. She's. amazing.
RACHEL: Oh boy.
TOM: You know.just cause some cute girl likes the same bizarro music you do doesn't make her "the one."
RACHEL: You know.just cause some cute girl likes the same bizarro music you do doesn't make her "the one."

SARAH: ( EXCITED ) ( GRIM )
RACHEL: ( GRIM )
SARAH: Oh shit.

TOM: What's complicated? Last week you said you loved me!
AMANDA: I know it's sudden but.
TOM: No, this can't be. Everything was going so great. I don't understand.
AMANDA: ( BEAT ) What's this?
TOM: What's this?
AMANDA: Because you're, like, the biggest music nerd I've ever met, I think this should really help explain where I'm coming from.
AMANDA: You remember how much I loved this song when you first played it for Sure. It's all you wanted to listen to for weeks.
TOM: Sure. It's all you wanted to listen to for weeks.
AMANDA: Right. And I still like it, don't get me wrong. It's just. When I hear it now, I don't feel the I press the skip button.
TOM: ( still confused ) I press the skip button.
AMANDA: I press the skip button.

AMANDA: I'd rather listen to something
TOM: But Amanda. this is a great fucking song!
TOM: It's off.

TOM: You believe that shit?
MCKENZIE: What shit?
PAUL: I think I missed something.
TOM: "It was good." She didn't say "It was good." She said "It was good." Emphasis on the good. She basically said "I spent the weekend having sex with this guy I met at the gym." Fucking whore. Screw her. It's over.
MCKENZIE: What the hell is wrong with you?!
PAUL: Dude, you got problems.
TOM: She's not interested in me. There's nothing I can do.
MCKENZIE: Based on."it was good?"
TOM: And some other things.
PAUL: Like what, she said "hey" instead of "hi" cause that totally means she's a lesbian.
TOM: I gave her all sorts of chances.
SUMMER: I'm going to the supply room. Anyone need anything?
MCKENZIE: No thanks.
TOM: I think you know what I need.
TOM: Oh ok, sure, no prob.
SUMMER: Oh ok, sure, no prob.
TOM: Do you want to go out with me?

MCKENZIE: This Friday. 10 bucks all you can karaoke at The Well.
TOM: No way McKenzie. Absolutely not.
MCKENZIE: Come on!
TOM: They won't let you back in there after last time.
MCKENZIE: I wasn't that bad.
TOM: Not at all. You just threw up on the stage, tried to fight the bartender, and then threatened to burn the place down before passing out on the sidewalk. Quiet night for you.
MCKENZIE: ( REVERENTIAL ) You saved my life that day.
TOM: We are not going back there.
MCKENZIE: This is a work thing, Tommy. It won't be like that. The whole office is going.
TOM: I really can't. Even if I wanted to. There's a lot of stuff I gotta take care of.
MCKENZIE: You're not listening to me.
TOM: The whole office is going.
MCKENZIE: The whole office is going.
TOM: Hey! They said you weren't coming.

MCKENZIE: I have no idea what you're talking It sounds selfish, I know, but. I just like being on my own. Relationships are messy and feelings are always getting hurt. Who needs all that? We're young. We're in one of the most beautiful cities in the world.
SUMMER: It sounds selfish, I know, but. I just like being on my own. Relationships are messy and feelings are always getting hurt. Who needs all that? We're young. We're in one of the most beautiful cities in the world.

TOM: Well mine too but
SUMMER: Oh yeah, And I read in Newsweek, there were these scientists who found that by stimulating a part of the brain with electrodes you can make a person fall in "love" with a rock. Is that the love you're talking about?
TOM: Why, what's your take on it?
SUMMER: Why, what's your take on it?
INT BAR: On Tom:
TOM: I think it's.kind of a huge Ok. Looks like we're gonna have to agree to disagree on that one.
SUMMER: ( BEAT ) Ok. Looks like we're gonna have to agree to disagree on that one.
MCKENZIE: So, uh, who's singing next?
SUMMER: ( re: singing ) I'd say it's your turn loverboy.
TOM: Nooo. I don't sing in public.
SUMMER: Sure you do. I see you lip-synching to your headphones every morning on your way in.
TOM: I don't.
MCKENZIE: You really do.
SUMMER: It's ok. I like it. Takes a lot of self-confidence to look ridiculous.
MCKENZIE: ( can't help himself ) Self-confidence! Ha!
TOM: Anyway, I'm not near drunk enough to sing in front of all these Ok then. Let's drink.
SUMMER: Ok then. Let's drink.
TOM: It would take at least ten shots to get me to sing.
SUMMER: TEN MINUTES LATER. Tom is up there singing The Clash's "Magnificent Seven." You wouldn't think so but Tom is a ROCK STAR up there! He's dancing like Jagger, he's got everyone in the bar singing along to the audience-participation parts. It's a sight to behold. Summer is all smiles watching.
TOM: That's not it.
SUMMER: What is that then?
TOM: I have no idea.
SUMMER: I used to watch it every week.
TOM: Me too. Why can't we think of the stupid A-Team theme song.
SUMMER: This is gonna bother me for weeks.
TOM: This is gonna bother me for weeks.
SUMMER: They share another laugh and then it gets quiet. In that good ANGLE ON McKenzie, wasted, singing the shit out of "Proud to Be an American." He really means it. At any minute he might start to cry.
MCKENZIE: "And I'd proudly stand UP!" I said stand!
TOM: Oh here we go.

TOM: Ok, let's get you in a cab.
MCKENZIE: No. I'm gonna walk. I live right down that street. Or that one.

SUMMER: ( RELIEVED ) God yes!
TOM: A lot of people have problems with this, but to me, it makes both structures so much more beautiful side by side like that.
TOM: The guy who made this, Maybeck, he is a God.
TOM: It just makes you feel. peaceful.
TOM: No. See now, this is torture.
SUMMER: Over there, that's St. Patrick's church. The beauty of St. Patrick's is its humility. With this giant mirror thing deflecting all the attention away, it's too humble. No one even knows it's there.

TOM: SUMMER ( V.O. )
MCKENZIE: Your girl is losing it.
SUMMER: This is not at all as easy as it
TOM: The curtain rips and the bar comes crashing down. They fall on top of each other laughing.
TOM: There's no way.
SUMMER: Why not?
TOM: "Octopus's Garden?" You may as well just say "Piggies?"
SUMMER: I told you. I love Ringo.
TOM: You're insane.
SUMMER: Cause nobody loves Ringo.
TOM: Cause nobody loves Ringo.
SUMMER: That's what I love about him.
SUMMER: ( FLIRTATIOUS ) This got great reviews.
SUMMER: Is that. possible?
PAUL: So what's going on with you and I don't know.
TOM: I don't know.
PAUL: Is she your girlfriend?
TOM: I wouldn't say that.
MCKENZIE: What would you say?
TOM: Like, are we "going steady?" Come on, guys. We're adults.
PAUL: It's not an unreasonable question. Watch. McKenzie, do you have a No I do not. In fact girls are repulsed by me. Paul, how about Why yes, in fact I do. Her name is Robyn. See Tom, it's easy.
MCKENZIE: No I do not. In fact girls are repulsed by me. Paul, how about Why yes, in fact I do. Her name is Robyn. See Tom, it's easy.
PAUL: Why yes, in fact I do. Her name is Robyn. See Tom, it's easy.
TOM: It is when you've been with the same girl since high school.

TOM: Something like that.
PAUL: And you haven't discussed it?
TOM: No! She's not. We're not like Like what?
PAUL: Like what?
MCKENZIE: We've just been. hanging out.
TOM: We've just been. hanging out.
PAUL: Hanging out?!
TOM: Yeah. Guys, look, Summer and I.we know how we feel. We don't need to label it. "Boyfriend, girlfriend." That stuff is very. juvenile.
MCKENZIE: You're so gay.
PAUL: Well let me ask you this then. Do you want her to be your girlfriend?
TOM: I don't know. Maybe.
MCKENZIE: I heard her Hansen. She's not the girlfriend type. You're gonna need to discuss it.
TOM: No. We're adults. It'll be fine.
MCKENZIE: Have you made her a CD yet?
TOM: ( BEAT ) Oh dude.
MCKENZIE: Oh dude.
PAUL: You really need to have that talk.
RACHEL: You were saying?
TOM: My thinking is. why rock the boat? Things are going well. If we start putting labels on it, that's like the kiss of death. Like saying to a girl "I love you."
RACHEL: I know what you mean. That's what happened with me and Sean.
TOM: Who the hell's Sean?
RACHEL: My boyfriend before Mark.
TOM: Who the f! Never mind. Help me. I need solid female advice.
RACHEL: I'm 12.
TOM: Yeah but, you know me. This is the kinda stuff that always gets me in Hmm. So, basically you do want to ask the question, `are we boyfriend/girlfriend?' You're just afraid you'll get an answer you don't want and that will shatter your illusions of how good everything's been these past few months. Is that about right?
RACHEL: Hmm. So, basically you do want to ask the question, `are we boyfriend/girlfriend?' You're just afraid you'll get an answer you don't want and that will shatter your illusions of how good everything's been these past few months. Is that about right?
TOM: ( BEAT ) Something like that.
RACHEL: Thomas, tell me this. Is it worse to get the wrong answer now. or find out in a month she has a date coming up with Lars from Norway?
TOM: Who's Lars?
RACHEL: He's a professional surfer with Brad Pitt's face and Jesus's abs.
TOM: That son of a bitch.
RACHEL: You see what I mean?
RACHEL: Later dude.
TOM: Coach, no, wait! I need her. Rachel, what do you think I should Just don't be a pussy.
RACHEL: ( calling back ) Just don't be a pussy.
SUMMER: Are you ok?
TOM: Are you ok?
SUMMER: Are you ok?
TOM: You sure?
SUMMER: You sure?
TOM: Summer, I've gotta ask you
SUMMER: He takes a deep breath. He's about to go on when:
SUMMER: Summer finds on the radio a particular song. ( "Waiting in Vain" by Bob Marley, if you must know. )
SUMMER: Whoa. Oh my god. We can't talk during this song. It's too
TOM: I just don't get women's fashion nowadays. Everybody with the tattoos, the giant hoop earrings, those annoying hats. Explain this to me.
SUMMER: People think it looks good.
TOM: Do you?
SUMMER: On some.
TOM: I like how you dress.
SUMMER: Yeah? What if I started wearing berets and got a huge butterfly tattoo on my leg?
TOM: ( BEAT ) Please don't.
DOUCHE: ( to Summer )
SUMMER: How's it going?
DOUCHE: How's it going?
SUMMER: Tom puts his hands in his pockets and watches this exchange go down. Not sure what else to do. At this point he's more amused than concerned.
DOUCHE: You live around here?
SUMMER: Yeah not too far.
DOUCHE: I've never seen you here before.
SUMMER: You're not too perceptive.
DOUCHE: Ha. That's funny.
DOUCHE: So, uh, let me buy you a drink.
SUMMER: No thank you.
DOUCHE: Are you with this guy?
TOM: ( BEAT ) Hi. I'm Tom.
DOUCHE: ( to Summer ) Come on, one drink. What are you Sorry, no thank you.
SUMMER: Sorry, no thank you.
DOUCHE: You're serious? This guy?
TOM: Hey buddy
SUMMER: ( to the Douche ) Don't be rude. I'm flattered, I'm just not interested. Now why don't you go back over there and leave us alone, ok?
DOUCHE: It's a free country.
DOUCHE: So you and him, huh? I can't believe that. Is this guy really your boyfriend?
TOM: Did you see that punch? I don't know where it came from. I haven't punched someone since Josh Greenberg in fifth grade. Guess I'm gonna have to throw out this shirt.
TOM: Hey. What is it?
SUMMER: I can't believe you.
TOM: You were so completely uncool in You're mad at me? I just got my ass kicked for you.
SUMMER: You were so completely uncool in You're mad at me? I just got my ass kicked for you.
TOM: You're mad at me? I just got my ass kicked for you.
SUMMER: Oh that was for me? You were, what, protecting me? Next time Tommy, don't. I fight my own battles.
TOM: Come on, that guy was an asshole!
SUMMER: You didn't have to hit him. Why didn't you just let me handle it?
TOM: I don't know. He was
SUMMER: See. This is why I don't want a serious relationship.
TOM: Whoa. What was that?
SUMMER: Nothing. Look, I like you Tom. I like this. What we've been doing. But maybe it's gone too.
TOM: I told you all along what I don't want and it's.
SUMMER: I told you all along what I don't want and it's.
SUMMER: I'm tired. Can we talk about this
TOM: ( calling to her ) I just got my ass kicked!
TOM: ( to Onlookers ) I got one good shot in.
TOM: ( GENUINE ) ( COLD ) What's up?

TOM: Summer. we don't have to label what we're doing. I just. I need -
SUMMER: I know -
TOM: Consistency. I need to know you won't wake up tomorrow and feel a different way.
SUMMER: I can't promise you that. Nobody can. Anyone who does is a liar.

TOM: Have you ever had a real A boyfriend. "Going steady." Whatever. You know what I mean.

SUMMER: Oh no way.
TOM: Cause there's nothing to tell.
SUMMER: Cause there's nothing to tell.
TOM: Come on, I'm interested.
SUMMER: You wanna have the relationship history conversation?
TOM: You sure about that?
SUMMER: You sure about that?
TOM: No. Yeah. I don't know. Why not? I can take it.
SUMMER: Ok. Well, in high school, there was
TOM: Quarterback slash homecoming king?
SUMMER: He was a rower. Very hot.
TOM: What happened to Markus?
SUMMER: He works for the Republican party. Very successful. Just not for me.
TOM: Ok. And then?
SUMMER: Well, for a short time in college, there was Kurt.
SUMMER: That didn't really go anywhere.
TOM: The Puma?
SUMMER: Yeah, cause, you know.
TOM: And that's it?
SUMMER: The ones that lasted.
TOM: What happened? Why didn't they work Nothing happened really. It's what always happens. Life.
SUMMER: Nothing happened really. It's what always happens. Life.
ALISON: So how long have you known Paul and Since grade school.
TOM: Since grade school.
ALISON: No way, really? That's crazy.
TOM: Well I'm glad you called. They spoke very highly of you.
ALISON: Well I'm glad you called. They spoke very highly of you.
TOM: INT RESTAURANT - LATER Tom and Alison eat. In silence.
ALISON: So.uh. how's it going?
TOM: You've been pretty quiet.
ALISON: You've been pretty quiet.
TOM: I'm pretty quiet too. Usually. It's nice sometimes to be comfortable enough that you can just sit and eat and not have to say anything, you know?
ALISON: I'm pretty quiet too. Usually. It's nice sometimes to be comfortable enough that you can just sit and eat and not have to say anything, you know?
TOM: More silence.
ALISON: Do you want to try some
TOM: No thanks.
TOM: I'm sorry. It's just. there's this girl.
ALISON: I'm not usually like this. I wasn't before. Long story short, she wrecked me. I don't know if you can tell but it was pretty recent and I'm still kinda thinking about her.
TOM: I'm not usually like this. I wasn't before. Long story short, she wrecked me. I don't know if you can tell but it was pretty recent and I'm still kinda thinking about her.
ALISON: ( DISAPPOINTED ) Well maybe you should think about. someone else. who could cheer you up.
TOM: I can't get her out of my head, you know? I see her everywhere. She's all I think about. And it's horrible. Cause I totally didn't see it coming. I thought things were fine. So now I keep going through every day in my mind, every second really. Wondering. What went wrong? Is it my fault? Could I have prevented it somehow?
TOM: A lot of people have problems with this, but to me, it makes both structures so much more beautiful side by side like that.
SUMMER: While you continue to talk about buildings and whatever other bullshit interests you, I'll just nod my head and pretend to listen while secretly dreaming about the many ways I can one day rip out your heart and eat it like the rabid vampire I am.
TOM: Maybe there were things I could have said or done, you know?
ALISON: Or. Christ, I don't know, maybe she was never that interested in me to begin with.
TOM: Or. Christ, I don't know, maybe she was never that interested in me to begin with.
TOM: ( BEAT ) How was your weekend?
SUMMER: ( winks at him ) It was good.
TOM: Anyway. sorry. If I'm acting strange, that's why.
ALISON: It's ok. I'm sure it's tough getting over an ex-girlfriend.
TOM: Actually she was never my
TOM: I just. I thought I'd have figured it out by now, you know? My life. Where I'm going, where I want to end up, who with. All that stuff. I still don't know anything. And the thing is. When I was with Summer, none of that mattered. I never even noticed how much of my life was missing! Isn't that weird?
ALISON: You were in love, that's what it does. But, now that you know where the holes are you can start to fill Hey, I've been talking non-stop. You talk.
TOM: ( BEAT ) Hey, I've been talking non-stop. You talk.
ALISON: Me? Well I grew up
TOM: So what do you think? Did I do something? Did I not do something? What can I do now?
ALISON: ( BEAT ) You wanna get out of here? I know this great.
TOM: ( suddenly excited ) Oh! You know what we should do.
TOM: "You said you'd stand by your man!/So tell me something I don't understand. You said you loved me!/And that's a fact! And then you left me, said you felt trapped!
TOM: "You didn't stand by me! Not at all! You didn't stand by me," I'm talking about you Summer!
SUMMER: Hey it's me.
TOM: Hello me. You having a good day?
SUMMER: I am thank you. Listen, about tonight. I think I might just stay in and go to bed early.
TOM: What? Why?
SUMMER: I'm just really tired and I've gotta go in early tomorrow. Would you be super mad at me if we went out this weekend instead?
TOM: Well. You don't want to just, maybe, go to dinner. I mean, you've gotta eat right?
SUMMER: I'm not really that hungry. And this place is fancy right?
TOM: ( touching his tie ) I'd rather not. Seriously, do you
SUMMER: I'd rather not. Seriously, do you
TOM: Hey, no, that's cool. Whatever you want to do.
SUMMER: Thank you. So we'll talk tomorrow, Great. Good night Tom.
TOM: Great. Good night Tom.
SUMMER: Great. Good night Tom.
TOM: Good night.
PAUL: I just got lucky I guess. We met in elementary school. We had the same class schedule in the 7th grade and we just. clicked.
MCKENZIE: Love? Shit, I don't know. As long as she's cute and she's willing, right? Actually, cute is a strong word. Not atrocious.
RACHEL: That's a pretty complex question. Philosophers, poets, scientists, everybody has a theory, don't they?
CU SUMMER: Ok I'm sick of this love shit. Come on! We've been fed this nonsense for generations to the point where it's now genetically encoded in our very beings. And what does it mean? Absolutely nothing. Give me a I'm just saying. I really need some ass. I'm desperate.
SUMMER: Ok I'm sick of this love shit. Come on! We've been fed this nonsense for generations to the point where it's now genetically encoded in our very beings. And what does it mean? Absolutely nothing. Give me a I'm just saying. I really need some ass. I'm desperate.
CU MCKENZIE: I'm just saying. I really need some ass. I'm desperate.
MCKENZIE: I'm just saying. I really need some ass. I'm desperate.
CU PAUL: I wouldn't say "the girl of my dreams," no. The girl of my dreams would have a better rack. Probably different hair, could like sports a little more. But. truth is. Robyn's better than the girl of my You know why? Cause she's real.
PAUL: I wouldn't say "the girl of my dreams," no. The girl of my dreams would have a better rack. Probably different hair, could like sports a little more. But. truth is. Robyn's better than the girl of my You know why? Cause she's real.
MCKENZIE: Hansen, don't you have like twenty bar mitzvah cards to write?
TOM: Nope. All done. What are you working on?
MCKENZIE: Congratulations. But I've run out of ways to say it. "Good job," "well done," "way to go". I got Why don't you try. "Everyday you make me proud. But today, you get a Shit. That's not bad.
TOM: Why don't you try. "Everyday you make me proud. But today, you get a Shit. That's not bad.
MCKENZIE: ( BEAT ) Shit. That's not bad.
TOM: No worries.
TOM: This is good Millie. "To my wife, the love of my life. I love you." That's very nice. I was thinking though, why not try something like. "Everyday that we don't meet is meaningless and incomplete." You know, spice it up a little.
TOM: Did you try. "Merry?"
ALL: What else you got?
TOM: What else you got?
EMPLOYEE #1: Tom says something totally in Yiddish. No one knows what the hell he just said except for one Employee who bursts out in tears of joy.
TOM: ".aint no woman got what you got, sista girl. Happy birthday to the lean, sheen, and sizzly mocha How's that?
TOM: Yeah. It's pretty cool.
TOM: You really want to see this?
SUMMER: It sounds amazing.
TOM: It's, like, all stabbing and shit.
SUMMER: All you take me to are sappy little romances. I want to see some open wounds, damn it. I want carnage.
TOM: All you take me to are sappy little romances. I want to see some open wounds, damn it. I want carnage.
SUMMER: All you take me to are sappy little romances. I want to see some open wounds, damn it. I want carnage.
TOM: Suddenly, Tom sees something at the front of the line.
TOM: Oh shit.
SUMMER: And here they come, Tom's mom and step-dad, Sarah and Martin. Tom's face registers a noticeable panic.
SARAH: Sarah and Martin are delighted at this coincidence. Sarah hugs and kisses her son.
TOM: ( looking at Summer ) Hi Mom.
TOM: Mom, Martin, this is Summer.
SARAH: Summer! Well hello! We've heard so much about you! It's so good to finally meet you.
SUMMER: You too.
MARTIN: ( to Tom ) Is this the girlfriend?
TOM: Well this is the girl friend I've told you about. I don't know if "girlfriend" is the right word.
SARAH: You going to see the serial killer Yes we are.
SUMMER: Yes we are.
SARAH: Great! Should we save you seats?
SUMMER: Ok. We'll see you inside.
SARAH: Ok. We'll see you inside.
TOM: Sorry about that.
SUMMER: It's fine.
TOM: You wanna go do something else? We can totally bolt.
SUMMER: Did you tell them I was your What?! No way. I never used that They seemed to think. I mean, why is your step-dad giving me a hug?
TOM: What?! No way. I never used that They seemed to think. I mean, why is your step-dad giving me a hug?
SUMMER: They seemed to think. I mean, why is your step-dad giving me a hug?
TOM: He's very.loving.
SUMMER: Does he hug all your friends?
SUMMER: You're not having any fun.
TOM: You're having enough for both of I'm dancing. I haven't danced in ages. God. Come on.
SUMMER: I'm dancing. I haven't danced in ages. God. Come on.
TOM: Come on! I wanna dance with you.
SUMMER: Come on! I wanna dance with you.
TOM: Where were you an hour ago? I might have danced then. I've been standing here by myself this whole time and you didn't look over once.
SUMMER: So you're pissed?
TOM: I'm not pissed. Summer. you know I hate this shit.
SUMMER: Then why are you here?
TOM: This is what you wanted to do so.we're doing it.
SUMMER: Yeah well, I didn't need a chaperone. Go home. You're a buzzkill standing there pouting.
TOM: ( HURT ) That's real nice.
SUMMER: But when he doesn't turn around she just shakes it off and starts dancing again.
TOM: You wanted to see me, Mr. Vance?
VANCE: Yes Hansen. Sit down.
TOM: Has something happened to you What do you mean?
TOM: What do you mean?
VANCE: A death in the family, someone taken ill.anything like that?
TOM: Look, I don't mean to pry. Does this have something to do with Summer leaving.
VANCE: Look, I don't mean to pry. Does this have something to do with Summer leaving.
TOM: My assistant.
TOM: ( faking badly ) Tom.everyone knows. Nevermind. The reason I'm asking. lately your work performance has been. a little off.
TOM: I'm not following.
VANCE: For example, here's something you wrote last week.
DESK ): "Roses are Red, Violets are Blue. Fuck You Whore." Now.most shoppers on Valentine's Day -
TOM: Mr. Vance. are you firing me?
VANCE: No, no, no. Relax Hansen. You're one of our most. adequate Ok. Well, I'm sorry. Things for me have been a little difficult.
TOM: Ok. Well, I'm sorry. Things for me have been a little difficult.
VANCE: That's ok. I understand that. I was just thinking. perhaps you could channel your energy into. this.
TOM: Funerals and sympathy?
VANCE: Misery, sadness, loss of faith, no reasons to live. it's perfect for you. Whaddaya say? Good? Good. Now back to work you go.
TOM: What's going on?
PAUL: We have news.
TOM: It's about her.
MCKENZIE: It's about her.
TOM: Do I want to hear it?
PAUL: Thats what we wanted to ask you.
MCKENZIE: It's just.lately you've You've been much much better.
PAUL: You've been much much better.
MCKENZIE: So maybe it's best we don't ever bring her up again.
PAUL: Just let sleeping dogs lie.
MCKENZIE: Leave those dogs alone Tom!
TOM: You guys, look, I'm. I appreciate what you're saying and, thank you, really, for putting up with me these past few months. I've been crazy. But I've accepted the fact that she and I were just two very different people who wanted very different things. I wanted to get serious. Shit, I loved her. And I know now, she just isn't the kind of girl who can settle down with one person and be happy. The way I wanted. And she probably never will. There was nothing I could do.
TOM: There's no fucking way!
MCKENZIE: It can't be. It's impossible!
TOM: It can't be. It's impossible!
PAUL: It is.
TOM: How do you know?
TOM: Jesus Christ people! Get a room!
MCKENZIE: I've been calling every five minutes. Are you ok?
MCKENZIE: I've been calling every five minutes. Are you ok?
TOM: What? Oh yeah. Great.
MCKENZIE: Do you need anything?
TOM: I'm out of twinkies.
MCKENZIE: I'm out of twinkies.
TOM: I'm out of twinkies.
MCKENZIE: Well let's go.
TOM: Go. where?
MCKENZIE: It's Thursday.
TOM: ( reacting to his name ) The Winter collection. You have anything to contribute?
TOM: Uh.no. I really don't.
TOM: Well I wouldn't say nothing. Actually, that's about right.
TOM: You know what.?
TOM: Can I say something about the cat?
VANCE: Well sure. Go ahead.
TOM: This here is, and Rhoda, you know I mean no disrespect. but this. this is total shit.
MCKENZIE: "Don't give up?" "You can do it?"
TOM: "Don't give up?" "You can do it?"
TOM: This isn't inspirational. It's suicidal. He tries that jump, I'm writing a sympathy card for that cat. That's the last thing I want to be doing with my life. It's bad enough writing these things for Hansen, this is a place of business. We don't cut down our co- That's cause we're liars! It's what we do here. Why don't we level with people? Stop feeding them nonsense?
VANCE: Hansen, this is a place of business. We don't cut down our co- That's cause we're liars! It's what we do here. Why don't we level with people? Stop feeding them nonsense?
TOM: That's cause we're liars! It's what we do here. Why don't we level with people? Stop feeding them nonsense?
TOM: Yes but think about it! Why do people buy these things? Not to say how they feel. There's paper and pens for that. People give these cards when they can't say how they feel. Or they're afraid to. And we provide the service that lets `em get away with that!
TOM: I say to hell with it! Let's level with America. Or at least make them speak for themselves! I mean, seriously, what's this.
TABLE ): "I'm sorry to hear your grandmother has passed." What the hell? Let's give em some truth. Something like, "Sorry to hear about your grandmother. Here's a card so I get some credit in your time of need. I'm sure it makes up for the fact that grandma's dead."
TOM: Think about it. "Congratulations on your new baby." Eh. How bout. "Congratulations on your new baby. Guess that's it for hanging out. Nice knowing ya, Hansen, sit down!
VANCE: Hansen, sit down!
TOM: ( picks up a card ) Wait, what's this? Ooh. fancy! Look at this one with all the hearts. Let's open it up. "Happy Valentine's Day, Sweetheart. I love you." Oh that's nice.
MCKENZIE: If someone gave me this card, Mr. Vance. I would eat it.
TOM: If someone gave me this card, Mr. Vance. I would eat it.
MCKENZIE: Tom recognizes he's losing his shit. He takes a seat on the boardroom table.
TOM: ( BEAT ) It's these greeting cards, Sir, these cards, these movies, these pop songs. They're responsible for all the lies, the heartache, everything! We're responsible!
TOM: I think we do a bad thing here. People should be able to say how they feel, how they really feel, without some strangers putting words in their mouths. The truth. A card is a nice thought but it shouldn't do the dirty work for you. You love someone, tell them yourself, in your own words. Maybe it's not love at all. Maybe there's no such thing as love. Maybe it's. "galoogoo."
TOM: It's all crap. We make and peddle crap. And sometimes people believe in this crap. I just can't do it anymore, Mr. Vance. There's enough bullshit in the world without my help. I quit.
TOM: There's no fucking way!
MCKENZIE: It can't be. It's impossible!
TOM: It can't be. It's impossible!
PAUL: It is.
TOM: How do you know?
MCKENZIE: We know.
TOM: But. It's May! We broke up last I know.
PAUL: I know.
TOM: And you said she was single at She was.
MCKENZIE: She was.
TOM: And now she's.
MCKENZIE: Now she's getting married.
TOM: Now she's getting married.
PAUL: I'm so sorry Tom.
TOM: It's insane.
PAUL: It's insane.
TOM: It's impossible. It doesn't make sense. Where did they meet? Is it someone we know?
PAUL: So everything she said. All that stuff about. it can't be. Not her. I know her too well. She wouldn't do that.
TOM: So everything she said. All that stuff about. it can't be. Not her. I know her too well. She wouldn't do that.
TOM: ( BEAT )
MCKENZIE: Let him go.
PAUL: Let him go.
RACHEL: Your apple pies are really great. So Uncle Sid and Aunt Ro, come light candle number eight!
AUNT ANITA: I can't believe that. No
TOM: I can't believe it either!
AUNT BETSY: What are you 30? You should be married now. With a family. What are you waiting for?
TOM: The right girl I guess.
AUNT BETSY: There's girls everywhere. I bet you have to beat em off with a stick.
TOM: Oh you'd be surprised.
AUNT ANITA: ( actually squeezing his
CHEEKS ): Look at this punum. Are all those girls blind?
AUNT BETSY: My friend Mimi has a granddaughter. Yay high. Great figure. Bosom out to here
TOM: Hey I appreciate that Aunt Betsy. Lord knows I like bosoms. It's just. I recently got out of a.well, I don't know what it was.
AUNT ANITA: Oh I'm sorry. When was that?
TOM: AUNT BETSY
AUNT BETSY: You mean.seven months ago?
AUNT ANITA: Was it a man?
TOM: AUNT BETSY
AUNT BETSY: She's means `are you a homosexual?'
TOM: No. Where's that coming from?
AUNT BETSY: We just always wondered.
AUNT ANITA: So how's work?
TOM: Well.glad you came?
SUMMER: Of course. Where am I exactly?
TOM: When you turn 13 in the Jewish religion, you officially become an

RACHEL: Yeah yeah yeah. Talk to me. How are Me? I'm good. I'm great.
TOM: Me? I'm good. I'm great.

TOM: That's nice.
RACHEL: What I tell ya? There are plenty other fish in the sea.
TOM: Those are guppies.
RACHEL: Who knows, someday one might turn out to be your "true love."
TOM: Are you making fun of me now?
RACHEL: No I'm serious.
