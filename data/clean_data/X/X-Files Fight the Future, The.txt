A CREATURE: Deeper in the cave. Fleeing the light and the men. We get only a brief glimpse of it in the torch light, seeing that it moves upright on two legs and has gray, dinosaur-like skin. And large black eyes. But it moves quickly enough away that any other identifying feature is lost in the deeper shadows.
THE PRIMITIVES: Removing crude weapons made of sharpened bone from under their thick fur garments, and scrabbling into the constricting cavern, giving chase. Following them as they moves with animal-like agility through the tightening space. Predatory hunters. Their torchlight catching:
THE CREATURE: As it disappears into a tight opening in a smaller crevice leading off the main one. The Primitives entering frame after a moment, only a few steps behind. The LEAD PRIMITIVE dropping to the cave floor, pulling himself into this same tight fissure in pursuit. Splitting off from his partner who exits frame still on the run.
DAY: Along with the spade of a shovel. And then the earthen cave ceiling gives way and A BOY wearing Nikes and an old t-shirt falls through it. Falling PAST CAMERA. We hear a YELL, then a THUD, and a CLATTERING of the shovel that's fallen in with him. Then a pained
2ND BOY: Hey, Stevie. You okay?
STEVIE: I got.I got..I got.. ..the wind knocked out of me.
3RD BOY: Looks like a cave or something.
2ND BOY: What's down there, Stevie? Anything?
STEVIE: Human skull.
3RD BOY: Toss it up here, dude.
STEVIE: No way, buttwipe. I found it. It's
STEVIE: Anyways, there's bones all over the place down here.
2ND BOY: You okay?
3RD BOY: Hey, man. Let's get outta here.
HOLE: TWO firemen carrying a ladder clamber down PAST CAMERA, THREE OTHERS appearing on their heels. The other two firemen clamber down, too. THE CAPTAIN at the edge of the hole watching them. Holding a radio.
FIRE CAPTAIN: This is Captain Miles Cooles.we've got a rescue situation in progress.
THEIR POV: Stevie's feet are just visible on the floor of the cave, a short distance away.
BRONSCHWEIG: ( over the chopper ) Keep those people back. Get them out of here.
FIRE CAPTAIN: ( to his men ) Move them all back. ( dogging Bronschweig ) I sent four men down after the boy. They're not responding.
DR. BRONSCHWEIG: And the gathering crowd. Bronschweig watches the chopper bank away, then turns his look to:
THE NEIGHBORHOOD: Where A SERIES OF UNMARKED CARGO VANS, TRUCKS are rolling in. A fleet of vehicles, driven by what looks like MILITARY PERSONNEL. Most conspicuously TWO WHITE UNMARKED TANKER TRUCKS. ( There are NO MARKINGS on these vehicles. )
RESUME BRONSCHWEIG: As the Fire Captain moves around to face him off.
FIRE CAPTAIN: What about my men?
DR. BRONSCHWEIG: ( brusquely ) We're doing all we can.
FBI AGENT: We've evacuated the building and been through it bottom to top. No trace of an explosive device or anything resembling one.
S.A.C. MICHAUD: Have you taken the dogs through?
FBI AGENT: Yes, sir.
S.A.C. MICHAUD: Well, take them through again.
SCULLY: Mulder it's me
SCULLY: I'm on the roof.
SCULLY: ( impatiently ) No. I haven't.
SCULLY: I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.
SCULLY: I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the I think they have that covered.
SCULLY: ( impatience ) Mulder. when a terrorist bomb threat is called in, the logical purpose of providing this information is to allow us to find the bomb. The rational object of terrorism is to promote terror. If you'd study model behavioral pattern in virtually every case where a threat has turned up an explosive device. If we don't act in accordance with that data if you ignore it as we have done the chances are great that if here actually is a bomb we might not find it. Lives could be lost
SCULLY: What happened to playing a hunch?
MULDER: What happened to playing a hunch?
SCULLY: Jesus, Mulder.
MULDER: The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced. What are we doing up here? It's hotter than hell.
MULDER: What are we doing up here? It's hotter than hell.
NEW ANGLE: Mulder is moving toward the stairs, Scully catching him. Mulder allowing her to lead him up the steps.
SCULLY: I know you're bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now.
MULDER: How's that?
SCULLY: You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.
MULDER: What do you say we call in a bomb threat for Houston. I think it's free beer night at the Astrodome.
SCULLY: Now what?
MULDER: ( suddenly nervous ) It's locked?
SCULLY: So much for anticipating the Had you.
SCULLY: Had you.
MULDER: No you didn't.
SCULLY: Oh yeah. Had you big time.
SCULLY: I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment of panic.
MULDER: Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, I just did. You're buying. Alright. what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi? A saline IV?
SCULLY: I just did. You're buying. Alright. what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi? A saline IV?
MULDER: Alright. what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi? A saline IV?
SCULLY: Something sweet.
MULDER: Oh, come on.
SCULLY: MULDER ( FILTER )
SCULLY: ( thinks he's joking ) Where are you, Mulder?
SCULLY: Is that you pounding?
MULDER: Scully, get somebody to open this Nice try, Mulder.
MULDER: Scully listen to me. It's in the coke machine. You've got about fourteen minutes to get this building
SCULLY: C'mon. Open the door.
SCULLY: Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
THE KEYHOLE: It's been freshly soldered over.
MULDER: .thirteen fifty six.
SCULLY: I need this building evacuated and cleared out in ten minutes! I need you to get on the phone and tell the fire department to block off the city center in one mile radius around the In ten minutes...?!
SECURITY GUARD: In ten minutes...?!
SCULLY: DON'T THINK! JUST PICK UP THE PHONE AND MAKE IT HAPPEN!
SCULLY: ( into phone ) This is Special Agent Dana Scully. I need to speak to S.A.C. Michaud. He's got the wrong building
S.A.C. MICHAUD: Where is it?
SCULLY: Mulder found it in a vending machine. He's locked in with it.
MULDER: SCULLY ( FILTER )
S.A.C. MICHAUD: The other Agents kick the metal door in sending it crashing to the floor. Mulder stands on the other side. Watching Michaud pick up a heft tool kit, stepping over the downed door. Scully right behind him. Along with the Agents, Bomb ANGLE OVER MULDER AND THE SODA MACHINE/BOMB As Michaud steps in next to him, sizing up the time on the ticking digital readout: 4:07. And just exactly what kind of defusing work he's got cut out for him.
MULDER: Tell me this is just soda pop in those No. It's what it looks like. A big I.E.D. - ten gallons of astrolite. Okay, get everybody out of here and clear the building.
S.A.C. MICHAUD: No. It's what it looks like. A big I.E.D. - ten gallons of astrolite. Okay, get everybody out of here and clear the building.
MULDER: Somebody's got to stay with you
S.A.C. MICHAUD: I gave you an order. Now get the hell out of here and evacuate the area.
SCULLY: Can you defuse it?
S.A.C. MICHAUD: I think so.
MULDER: You've got about four minutes to find out if you're wrong.
S.A.C. MICHAUD: Did you hear what I said?
SCULLY: Let's go, Mulder.
SCULLY: What are you doing?
MULDER: Something's wrong.
WINDBREAKERED AGENT: What's he doing?
MULDER: Something's not right.
SCULLY: Mulder! Get in the car!
SCULLY: There's no time!
S.A.C. MICHAUD: Sitting motionless in front of the bomb as the seconds tick down. 8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1-
RESUME BUILDING: As the debris starts to clear somewhat, much of it still floating to the ground, though. We see the fires raging on every floor. That most of the front of the building has been torn away and we can see right into many RESUME ANGLE ON CAR Where it sits half cocked against a parked car. The air is full of debris, particulated matter. The rear door of the squad car opens now and Mulder gets out, covered with glass. Moving to the front passenger door, opening it for Scully.
MULDER: ( with darkest irony ) Next time you're buying.
CASSIDY: .for the catastrophic destruction of public property and the loss of life due to terrorist activities.
AGENT SCULLY: At a small table, the chair next to her conspicuously The door to the room opens behind Scully now, and Mulder enters, his manner that of a man who knows he's late to a function.
CASSIDY: Many details are still unclear; some agents' reports have not been filed, or have come in sketchy, without a satisfactory accounting of the events that led to the destruction in Dallas. But we're under some pressure to give an accurate picture of what happened to the Attorney General, so she can issue a public statement.
CASSIDY: We now know that five people died in the explosion. Special Agent in Charge Darius Michaud who was trying to defuse the bomb that had been hidden in a vending machine. Three firemen from Dallas, and a young boy.
MULDER: Excuse me the firemen and the boy they were in the building?
CASSIDY: Agent Mulder, since you weren't able to be on time for this hearing, I'm going to ask you to step outside so that we can get Agent Scully's version of the facts. So that she won't have to be paid the same disrespect.
MULDER: We were told the building was clear.
CASSIDY: You'll get your turn, Agent Mulder. Please step out.
A.D. SKINNER: Who stares at him evenly, but not unsympathetically. He's been here with Mulder on many occasions. Seen Mulder run up against the Bureau and its stiff conventions. Always in the middle.
MULDER: It does say there in your paperwork that we were the ones who found the Thank you, Agent Mulder. We'll call you in shortly.
CASSIDY: Thank you, Agent Mulder. We'll call you in shortly.
SKINNER: Sit down, they're still talking to Agent Scully.
MULDER: About what?
SKINNER: They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.
MULDER: She was with me.
SKINNER: You don't see what's going on here, do There's four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of Dallas. Lives have been lost. No suspects have been named. So the story being shaped is this could have been prevented. That the FBI didn't do its job.
MULDER: And they want to blame us?
SKINNER: Agent Mulder we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred
MULDER: ( grasping the irony ) But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
SKINNER: ( reciting the dictum ) if it looks bad, it's bad for the
FBI: if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. Agent Scully doesn't deserve this.
MULDER: if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. Agent Scully doesn't deserve this.
SKINNER: She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
MULDER: I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
SKINNER: Agent Scully says it was she who ordered you out of the building. That you wanted to go back.
SCULLY: ( to Skinner ) They're asking for you, Sir. Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.
MULDER: Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.
SCULLY: All I told them was the truth.
MULDER: They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
SCULLY: They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
MULDER: ( beat ) What? What are you talking about?
SCULLY: I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment.
MULDER: I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
SCULLY: I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
MULDER: They were the ones that put us Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.
SCULLY: Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.
MULDER: This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
SCULLY: They're not doing this, Mulder. I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and You're. quitting?
MULDER: You're. quitting?
SCULLY: There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore. Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.
SKINNER: Agent Mulder. You're up.
SCULLY: ( regretfully ) I'm sorry. Good luck.
BARMAID: I'd say this about exceeds your minimum daily requirement.
MULDER: He sits by himself on a stool, staring down at the bar. Staring at the shooter which he spins with his fingers.
BARMAID: Gotta train for this kind of heavy
BARMAID: Poopy day?
MULDER: A woman?
BARMAID: A woman?
BARMAID: What do you do?
MULDER: What do I do. I'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade. An annoyance to my superiors. A joke among my peers. "Spooky," they call me. Spooky Mulder. Whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid. Who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun, shouting to the heavens and anyone who'll listen that the fix is in. That our government's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy. That the sky is falling and when it hits it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time. I think that about does it, Spooky.
BARMAID: I think that about does it, Spooky.
MULDER: Does what?
BARMAID: Why don't you go home to the old lady
MULDER: Sorry. Don't have one.
MULDER'S POV: The Watchful Man is gone.
RESUME MULDER: He feints toward the door, then reverses direction. Heads to the back of the place.
MULDER: ( startled )
KURTZWEIL: Bet the Bureau's accusing you of the same thing in Dallas. How's that?
MULDER: How's that?
KURTZWEIL: Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.
MULDER: Do I know you?
KURTZWEIL: No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent before
MULDER: You follow me out here for a reason?
KURTZWEIL: Yeah, I did.
KURTZWEIL: My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin I know the name. Why?
MULDER: I know the name. Why?
KURTZWEIL: Old friend of your father's. Back at the Department of State. We were what you might call fellow travelers, but his disenchantment outlasted mine. I never believed in the Project.
KURTZWEIL: Back at the Department of State. We were what you might call fellow travelers, but his disenchantment outlasted mine. I never believed in the Project.
KURTZWEIL: Oh, come on. Don't pretend you don't know about the Project. Your father died for it. Your sister was taken because of it. How'd you find me?
MULDER: How'd you find me?
KURTZWEIL: Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight.
MULDER: You a reporter?
KURTZWEIL: I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN.
MULDER: Who sent you?
KURTZWEIL: I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.
MULDER: Well, if you've got something to tell me, you've got as long as it takes me to hail a cab. They're going to pin Dallas on you, Agent Mulder. But there was nothing you could've done. Nothing anyone could've done to prevent that bomb from going off. Because the truth is something you'd never have guessed; never have predicted.
KURTZWEIL: They're going to pin Dallas on you, Agent Mulder. But there was nothing you could've done. Nothing anyone could've done to prevent that bomb from going off. Because the truth is something you'd never have guessed; never have predicted.
MULDER: And what's that?
KURTZWEIL: S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
MULDER: ( rhetorical disbelief ) He just let it explode.
KURTZWEIL: What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal The Federal Building was too well No. They put the bomb in the building across the street because it DID have federal offices. The Federal Emergency Management Agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there. Which is where the bodies were found. But that's the thing. .the thing you didn't know. That you'd never think to check.

KURTZWEIL: .the thing you didn't know. That you'd never think to check.
KURTZWEIL: Those people were already dead.
MULDER: Before the bomb went off?
KURTZWEIL: That's what I'm saying.
MULDER: Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau
KURTZWEIL: Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict.
MULDER: You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three And one little boy. I think you're full of shit.
KURTZWEIL: And one little boy. I think you're full of shit.
MULDER: I think you're full of shit.
KURTZWEIL: Do you?
MULDER: ( strangely intense ) I wake you?
SCULLY: Why not? It's three AM. Are you drunk, Mulder?
MULDER: Why not? It's three AM. Are you drunk, Mulder?
SCULLY: Are you drunk, Mulder?
MULDER: I was until about an hour ago.
SCULLY: Is that before or after you got the idea to come here?
MULDER: What are you implying, Scully?
SCULLY: ( frowning ) I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.
MULDER: Is that what you'd like me to do?
SCULLY: Go home, Mulder. It's late.
MULDER: Get dressed, Scully.
SCULLY: Mulder what are you doing?
MULDER: Just get dressed. I'll explain on the
DR. BRONSCHWEIG: ( nervous excitement )
DR. BRONSCHWEIG: We brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development, which is nothing like we've ever seen.
DR. BRONSCHWEIG: Heat, I think. The coincident invasion of a host, the fireman, and an environment that raised his basic body temperature above ninety eight point
DR. BRONSCHWEIG: Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.
DR. BRONSCHWEIG: The developing organism is using his life energy, digesting bone and tissue. We've just slowed the
DR. BRONSCHWEIG: Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?
DR. BRONSCHWEIG: And if it's unsuccessful?
DR. BRONSCHWEIG: This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest.
DR. BRONSCHWEIG: Of what?
MULDER: We're going to the morgue.
MULDER: On whose orders?
MULDER: General McAddie is who requested our coming here. We were awakened at three AM and told to get down here I don't know anything about that.
MULDER: Well, call General McAddie.
MULDER: They can patch you in through the
MULDER: Hey! We don't have time to dick around here watching you demonstrate your ignorance in the chain of command. The order came direct from General McAddie. Call him. We'll conduct our business while you confirm
MULDER: Thank you. Why is a morgue suddenly off limits on orders of a general?
MULDER: Why is a morgue suddenly off limits on orders of a general?
SCULLY: This is one of the firemen who died in According to this tag.
MULDER: According to this tag.
SCULLY: And you're looking for?
SCULLY: I can tell you that without even looking at him. Conclusive organ failure due to proximal exposure to source and flying
SCULLY: This body has already been autopsied, Mulder. You can tell from the way it's been wrapped and dressed.
MULDER: Does this fit the description you just read me, Scully?
SCULLY: Oh my God. This man's tissue.
MULDER: It's like jelly.
SCULLY: There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous.
SCULLY: And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam.
MULDER: You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
SCULLY: I don't know what killed this man. I'm not sure if anybody else could claim to either.
SCULLY: ( pushing him ) You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.
MULDER: I'd been told as much.
SCULLY: You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
MULDER: I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.
SCULLY: Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here. I'm in serious violation of medical We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
MULDER: We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
MULDER: ( to the Cabbie ) I think this is it up here.
MULDER: Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?
DETECTIVE: ( suspiciously ) You got some kind of business with I'm looking for him.
MULDER: I'm looking for him.
DETECTIVE: Looking for him for what?
DETECTIVE: ( to his partners ) Feds are looking for him, too. ( turns to Mulder ) Real nice business he's got, huh?
MULDER: What's that?
DETECTIVE: Selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer.
DETECTIVE: You looking for him for some other Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic examination.
MULDER: Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic examination.
DETECTIVE: You want a call if we turn up No. Don't bother.
MULDER: No. Don't bother.
MULDER'S POV: Kurtzweil has stepped from between two apartments. He's staring at Mulder, nodding furtively to him. Then stepping back.
RESUME MULDER: Slows, then speeds up.
KURTZWEIL: See this bullshit.? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.
MULDER: Not according to the men in blue.
KURTZWEIL: What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.
MULDER: They want to discredit you for For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why.
KURTZWEIL: For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why.
MULDER: You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why.
KURTZWEIL: You know my work?
MULDER: ( pointedly ) Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run I don't either, but it sure sells
KURTZWEIL: I don't either, but it sure sells
KURTZWEIL: I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder?
MULDER: I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?

KURTZWEIL: According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?
MULDER: It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.
KURTZWEIL: And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that. What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?
MULDER: Are you saying it wasn't such a small
KURTZWEIL: I'm saying it wasn't the Hanta virus.
MULDER: What was it?
KURTZWEIL: When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins.
MULDER: What killed those men?
KURTZWEIL: What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect.
MULDER: I'll know soon enough.
KURTZWEIL: ( worked up ) What killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. Of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved.
MULDER: A plague?
KURTZWEIL: The plague to end all plagues, Agent Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet war. The systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure. They've been working on this for fifty years. While the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned Armageddon.
MULDER: Negotiating with whom?
KURTZWEIL: I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.
MULDER: And they tell me I'm paranoid.
KURTZWEIL: Something's gone wrong something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late. How can I reach you?
MULDER: How can I reach you?
KURTZWEIL: You can't.
MULDER: No calling Hawaii.
THEIR POV: Where Scully stood moments ago, there is now just an unattended gurney. A sheet over the fireman's body. Scully is gone. RESUME YOUNG NAVAL GUARD, MPs Tense. Listening, watchful. Moving into the room.
SCULLY: ( low whisper )
MULDER: Why are you whispering?
SCULLY: I can't really talk right now.
MULDER: What did you find?
SCULLY: Evidence of a massive infection.
MULDER: What kind of infection?
SCULLY: I don't know.
MULDER: Scully listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
SCULLY: I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
MULDER: I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
SCULLY: I've got a hearing tomorrow
MULDER: I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
SCULLY: Mulder I can't I'm already way past the point of common sense here
MULDER: Scully.? Hello.?
MULDER: Scully.? Hello.?
FIELD AGENT: You're looking for what amounts to a needle in a haystack. I'm afraid the explosion was so devastating there hasn't been a whole lot we've been able to put together just yet.
MULDER: I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington.
FIELD AGENT: We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington.
MULDER: Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.?
FIELD AGENT: Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.
MULDER: Have you examined them?
FIELD AGENT: No. Just fossils, far as I know.
MULDER: I'd like this person to take a look, if you don't mind.
FIELD AGENT: Let me just see if I can lay my hands on what you're looking for.
MULDER: You said you weren't coming?
SCULLY: I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
MULDER: What did you find?
SCULLY: ( voice lowering pointedly ) Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right ( off Mulder's look ) The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.
MULDER: How was it contracted?
SCULLY: That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.
FIELD AGENT: Like I said, these are fossils, and they weren't near the blast center, so they aren't going to tell you much.
SCULLY: May I?
MULDER: You said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were Show you right on a map.
FIELD AGENT: Show you right on a map.
DR. BRONSCHWEIG: I need to have those settings checked and re-set. I need a steady minus two Celsius through the transfer of the body, after I administer the vaccine.
DR. BRONSCHWEIG: It's gone!
TECHNICIAN: It's what?
DR. BRONSCHWEIG: It's left the body. I think it's
DR. BRONSCHWEIG: Wait I see it
BRONSCHWEIG'S POV: In the shadows there is movement, the creature edging into the light cast from the draped area. We see it is fully formed a replica of the Creature we saw at the opening of our story. Though it does not make any kind of aggressive move. As if, newborn, it is tentative.
DR. BRONSCHWEIG: ( nervous wonder ) Oh my god. Oh my god.
TECHNICIAN: You see it?
DR. BRONSCHWEIG: Yes. It's.amazing. You want to get down here Jesus Lord.so much for little green
DR. BRONSCHWEIG: Hey I need help.
DR. BRONSCHWEIG: But he gets no answer, climbing the ladder shakily. A moment later the first Bobcat shovel-full of dirt falls onto the clear hatch and partially obscures the light. They are burying Bronschweig alive.
THE CREATURE: Right behind and just below him. Its grotesque features in momentary high resolution, BEFORE IT ATTACKS CAMERA. Over and over, savaging Bronschweig in a violent fury. Its hideous teeth tearing at his flesh - AT CAMERA - driving him off the ladder where the attack continues in momentary glimpses of teeth, of bloody flesh, and of OILY BLACK BLOOD being spattered about. At the height of the violence we hear Bronschweig SCREAM. Matching the wound of this, as we:
VALET'S VOICE: Sir you have a call.
HIS VALET: Holds the door. After a moment the W.M.M. enters past the Valet. As the screams of the children continue to rise and fall.
EVENING: The Well-Manicured Man enters, picks up a blinking line. Through a window he can still see the children playing.
VALET: They're in the library.
STRUGHOLD: We began to worry. Some of us have traveled so far, and you are the last to arrive.
STRUGHOLD: While we've been made to wait, we've watched surveillance tapes which have raised more concerns.
STRUGHOLD: We've been forced to reassess our role in Colonization by new facts of biology which have presented The virus has mutated.
GROUP ELDER: ( speaking up ) The virus has mutated.
STRUGHOLD: A new extraterrestrial biological
STRUGHOLD: The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization.
2ND ELDER: It could be an isolated case.
STRUGHOLD: We're going to tell them what we've found. What we've learned. Turn over a body infected with the gestating In hope of what? Learning that it's true?! That we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!
STRUGHOLD: Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old. What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.
STRUGHOLD: Cooperation is our only chance of saving ourselves.
STRUGHOLD: We'll continue to use them as they do us. If only to play for more time, to continue work on our vaccine.
STRUGHOLD: Well, without a cure for the virus, we're nothing more than digestives
STRUGHOLD: We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?
STRUGHOLD: And Mulder?
ELDER: Our new situation makes us vulnerable. If he learns information as we do, he could jeopardize the Project's Control of information means control of Mulder.
2ND ELDER: Control of information means control of Mulder.
STRUGHOLD: This may take another approach.
STRUGHOLD: You need not kill a man to destroy No, you need only take away what is most precious to him.
AGENT SCULLY: She stands against a backdrop of Texas flatland, squinting into the sun. Shaking her head.
SCULLY: I don't know, Mulder. He didn't mention a park.
SCULLY: He didn't mention a park.
MULDER: This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed.
SCULLY: I don't see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite. Not even a sewer or a storm
MULDER: You're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman's body in the The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.
SCULLY: ( nodding ) The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.
MULDER: And you've never seen anything like No. It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests
SCULLY: No. It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests
MULDER: This looks like new grass to you?
SCULLY: It looks pretty green for this Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say.
MULDER: Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say.
SCULLY: ( looking off ) All the equipment is brand new.
MULDER: No irrigation system. Somebody's covering their tracks.
MULDER: They don't answer. Just keep staring, squinting into the sun. Mulder and Scully start walking toward them.
SCULLY: Do you live around here?
2ND BOY: As the Agents approach.
MULDER: You see anybody digging here?
2ND BOY: Not supposed to talk about it.
SCULLY: You're not supposed to talk about it? Who told you that?
3RD BOY: Nobody. Same nobody who put this park in? That new equipment. They buy you these bikes?
MULDER: Nobody. Same nobody who put this park in? That new equipment. They buy you these bikes?
SCULLY: I think you better tell us.
2ND BOY: We don't even know you.
SCULLY: Well, we're FBI agents.
2ND BOY: You're not FBI agents.
MULDER: How do you know?
2ND BOY: Cause FBI agents wear like suits and goofy ties. And dresses like my mom wears to church. Like on that one Maybe you've been watching too much
MULDER: Maybe you've been watching too much
3RD BOY: They all left twenty minutes ago.
4TH BOY: Going that way.
MULDER: Unmarked tanker trucks. what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker I don't know, Mulder.
SCULLY: I don't know, Mulder.
MULDER: And where are they going with it?
SCULLY: That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.
MULDER: What are my choices?
SCULLY: About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
MULDER: Where would they be going?
SCULLY: We've got two choices. One of them is You think they went left?
MULDER: You think they went left?
SCULLY: I don't know why I think they went
MULDER: Five years together how many times have I been wrong.
MULDER: Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?
SCULLY: This is great. This is fitting.
MULDER: I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
SCULLY: I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
MULDER: We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence
SCULLY: of what exactly?!
MULDER: That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
SCULLY: They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
MULDER: Yeah, well they may this one.
SCULLY: What do you mean by haul? What are you not telling me here?
MULDER: This virus it.
SCULLY: It may be extraterrestrial.
MULDER: It may be extraterrestrial.
SCULLY: I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this. Y'know, I've been here. I've been here one too many times with you, Been where?
MULDER: Been where?
SCULLY: Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end
SCULLY: What do you think it is?
MULDER: I have no idea.
SCULLY: This is weird, Mulder.
MULDER: Very weird.
SCULLY: Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there.
MULDER: Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there.
SCULLY: Cool in here. Temperature's being For the purpose of what?
MULDER: For the purpose of what?
SCULLY: I think we're on top of something. I think these are some kind of venting.
MULDER: You hear that?
SCULLY: I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.
MULDER: Maybe. Maybe not.
SCULLY: What do you think those are for?
THEIR POV: At the top of the dome are two LARGE corresponding

SCULLY: ( yelling, on the run ) What are you doing?
MULDER: ( yelling back ) Come on!
HIGH ANGLE: THICK STREAMS of bees head RIGHT AT CAMERA, flying for the open louvers at the top of the dome. As Mulder and Scully run for it down below.
HANDHELD: Running flat out now, knocking away the stalks and leaves that block their way. Following and leading shots. POVs and Tracking shots. And chasing angles, as the Agents run through the only cover they've got. As:
SCULLY: ANGLE ELSEWHERE ON MULDER As he too runs to a stop. Hearing his name.
MULDER: RESUME SCULLY Reacting to the sound of her name, but there's no time to find her bearings on Mulder. Not before she has to take flight again. As one of the choppers appears overhead, hovering into view. Knocking the corn down in a path moving straight toward her. CAMERA LEADING HER as she runs from the oncoming craft.

MULDER: Mulder reacting to the sound of her response:
SCULLY: ( distant o.s. )
THEIR POV: The helicopters have disappeared.
SCULLY: Where'd they go?
MULDER: I don't know.
SKINNER: She's coming in.
CASSIDY: Special Agent Scully
SCULLY: I apologize for making you wait I've brought some new evidence with me
CASSIDY: Evidence of what?
SCULLY: These are fossilized bone fragments I've been able to study, gathered from the bomb site in Dallas.
CASSIDY: You've been back to Dallas?
SCULLY: Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove
CASSIDY: Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove
SCULLY: That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully
CASSIDY: ( challenging ) those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully
SCULLY: Yes. I know.
CASSIDY: And you have conclusive evidence of this? Something to tie this claim of yours to the crime
SCULLY: ( grudgingly ) Nothing completely conclusive I hope to. We're working to develop this evidence
SCULLY: I hope to. We're working to develop this evidence
CASSIDY: Working with?
SCULLY: Agent Mulder.
KURTZWEIL: You found something?
MULDER: Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.
KURTZWEIL: I'm not sure. A virus
MULDER: I'm not sure. A virus
KURTZWEIL: You saw this experiment?
MULDER: What did it look like?
MULDER: There were bees. And corn crops.
MULDER: What are they?
KURTZWEIL: What do you think?
MULDER: A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.
KURTZWEIL: That would be my guess.
MULDER: Your guess?
MULDER: What do you mean, your guess? You told me you had answers.
MULDER: You told me you had answers.
KURTZWEIL: Yeah, well I don't have them all.
MULDER: You've been using me
KURTZWEIL: I've been using you?!
MULDER: You didn't know my father
KURTZWEIL: I told you he and I were old You're a liar. You lied to me to gather information for you. For your goddamn books. Didn't you?
MULDER: You're a liar. You lied to me to gather information for you. For your goddamn books. Didn't you?
MULDER: Kurtzweil turns to him. With restrained ferocity.
KURTZWEIL: You'd be shit out of luck if not for me. You saw what you saw because I led you to it. I'm putting my ass on the line for you.
MULDER: Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
KURTZWEIL: And why do you think it is you're standing here talking to me? These people don't make mistakes, Agent
MULDER'S POV: Up on a fire escape, A MAN is moving. Mulder can only see his feet and legs from this angle, but it is clear he has been watching Mulder. Upon being spotted, the figure slides away and disappears.
SCULLY: In his haste, Mulder had neglected to lock his door. Scully is pushing it open. She's still in the same clothes. She looks beat. Her eyes meeting Mulder's. A gaze that says bad news.
MULDER: What? What's wrong?
SCULLY: Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.
SCULLY: I already gave Skinner my letter of You can't quit, Scully.
MULDER: You can't quit, Scully.
SCULLY: I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew
MULDER: We're close to something here we're on the verge
SCULLY: You're on the verge, Mulder please don't do this to me
MULDER: After what you saw last night after all you've seen you can't just walk I have. I did. It's done.
SCULLY: I have. I did. It's done.
MULDER: Just like that
SCULLY: I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers
MULDER: I need you on this, Scully
SCULLY: You don't Mulder you've never needed me. I've only held you back. I've got to go.
MULDER: You're wrong
SCULLY: Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.
MULDER: You saved me, Scully. As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing. I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.
SCULLY: Scully pulls away from Mulder, RUBBING at her neck where his hand had been.
OUCH!!!: Scully pulls away from Mulder, RUBBING at her neck where his hand had been.
MULDER: What? What happened?
SCULLY: I think. something stung me.
MULDER: It must.
MULDER: Something's wrong. I'm having lancinating pain my chest. My. motor functions are being affected. I'm.
SCULLY: Something's wrong. I'm having lancinating pain my chest. My. motor functions are being affected. I'm.
SCULLY: .my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my I think you're in anaphylactic shock
MULDER: I think you're in anaphylactic shock
SCULLY: No it's
MULDER: I've got no allergy. Something. this. Mulder. I think. I think you should call an ambulance.
SCULLY: I've got no allergy. Something. this. Mulder. I think. I think you should call an ambulance.
MULDER: This is Special Agent Fox Mulder. I have an emergency I have an agent
1ST PARAMEDIC: Can you hear me? Can you say your
1ST PARAMEDIC: She's got constriction in the throat and larynx are you breathing okay?
1ST PARAMEDIC: Passages are open. Let's get her in the van
1ST PARAMEDIC: Coming through people here we go. Coming through
MULDER: She said she had a taste in the back of her throat there was no pre-existing allergy to bee-stings the bee that stung her may have been carrying a virus
2ND PARAMEDIC: A virus?
1ST PARAMEDIC: Get on the radio, tell them we have a cytogenic reaction, we need an advise and administer
ON MULDER: A moment of vague recognition a catch in his step.
RESUME: As Mulder's momentum carries him to the driver's window where se see again the man from the vending room, who was also surveilling Mulder. And he has a HANDGUN pointed at Mulder, which he FIRES THROUGH THE WINDOW. The glass shattering.
RESUME MULDER: Throwing himself away backward, but the bullet catches him in the head. Blood and glass spraying onto the side of the van. He goes down to the ground as the paramedic van accelerates fast away.
BYERS: I think he's coming out
LANGLY: He's coming to.
FROHIKE: Hey, Mulder.
FROHIKE: Behind Frohike, looking down at Mulder, are Byers and REVERSE ON MULDER Staring at the diminutive Frohike, the long-haired Langly and the courtly Byers with dawning recognition.
MULDER: Oh god.
LANGLY: What's wrong?
MULDER: ( to Byers, then Langly ) Tin Man. Scarecrow. ( to Frohike )
MULDER: What am I doing here?
BYERS: You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.
MULDER: ( woozy ) Penetration but not perforation.
LANGLY: Three centimetres to the left and we'd be playing the harp.
BYERS: They gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma. But you've been unconscious since they brought you in.
MULDER: When was that?
FROHIKE: Two days ago. Your guy Skinner's been here with you around the clock.
LANGLY: We got the news and made a trip to your apartment. Found a bug in your phone line.
FROHIKE: And one in your hall.
MULDER: Scully had a violent reaction to a bee You called 911. Except the call was They took her
BYERS: You called 911. Except the call was They took her
MULDER: ( sitting up ) They took her
SKINNER: Agent Mulder
MULDER: Where's Scully?! She's missing. We've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in.
SKINNER: She's missing. We've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in.
MULDER: Whoever they are this goes right back to Dallas it goes right back to the bombing
SKINNER: I know. Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
MULDER: ( reeling ) How deep does this go?
SKINNER: I don't know.
MULDER: Are we being watched?
SKINNER: I'm not taking any chances.
MULDER: I need your clothes, Byers.
BYERS: What are you doing?
SKINNER: What are you doing?
MULDER: I've got to find Scully.
FROHIKE: Do you know where she is?
MULDER: No. But I know someone who might have an answer. Who better.
KURTZWEIL: Jesus Christ. You're surprised. Certainly you've been expecting some response to your I'm quite sure whatever you told Agent Mulder, you have your good reason. It's a weakness in men our age; the urge to confess. I forgive you that.
KURTZWEIL: What are you doing here? What do you want from me?
REVERSE ANGLE: A TOWN CAR has pulled into the alley behind him. Accelerating fast down the narrow corridor. Effectively trapping Kurtzweil in. As he squints into its headlights, then turns back with fear in his eyes to the
RESUME MULDER: Moving through the bar real panic in his expression. He heads to the back.
MULDER: What happened to Kurtzweil?
MULDER: Where's Scully?
MULDER: Is she alive?
MULDER: About the conspiracy?
MULDER: I want to know where Scully is.
MULDER: What is it?
MULDER: ( beat ) You're lying.
MULDER: ( dubious, to say the least ) A virus?
MULDER: This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
MULDER: What do you mean, walked?
MULDER: That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy
MULDER: But. he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha.
MULDER: Why are you telling me this?
MULDER: What happened to Kurtzweil?
MULDER: Where is he?
MULDER: Let me out. Stop the car.
MULDER: WELL-MANICURED MAN ( beat )
MULDER: What alien environment?
MULDER: What about you?
MULDER'S POV: In the distance is an ICE STATION. A row of interconnecting WHITE DOME TENTS, whose design is now familiar to us. There are what look like snow tractors and other snow vehicles parked alongside the RESUME MULDER Pulling a compact pair of binoculars from one of his deep jacket pockets. Training them on:
RESUME MULDER: Pulling a compact pair of binoculars from one of his deep jacket pockets. Training them on:
FOLLOWING MULDER: The ice station still several hundred yards in the distance, when MULDER SUDDENLY FALLS OUT OF FRAME, disappearing into a hole in the snowscape crust that just moments earlier had been stable footing.
NEW ANGLE: Mulder has fallen on a hard, narrow metallic structure. Its dull black color a stark contrast to the white ice it's encased in. The bubble has been created by air coming out of vents in the structure, carving out corresponding patterns in the ceiling; softening the ice and snow above.
MULDER'S POV: It is dark in here, the features of the corridor RESUME MULDER - WIDER Mulder pulls a flashlight from a pocket in his parka, snicks it on. Its beam reflecting off tall frozen liths of ice regularly spaced on both sides of the corridor.
MULDER'S POV: There on the floor, far down below, is THE BUBBLE LITTER Scully was transported in. ( NOTE Scully's clothes are still in the bubble litter. ) Standing out as a rather human artifact against the otherwise dull gray bulwarks and architecture surrounding it.
MULDER: looks beside him where the joint that connects two sections of one of the long tube spokes is designed with an allowance a separation that might allow a man to slip through the joint into the tube. Which is what Mulder does here.
MULDER: hurries to get his jacket unzipped. Removing the FELT ENVELOPE, removing the syringe body, the needle and the
MULDER: Scully's lips move goldfish-like as she tries to suck in air, an almost fearful expression overcoming her like a swimmer who's been held under too long. But no words are coming out yet.
MULDER: Breathe can you breathe?!
MULDER: CLOSE ON MULDER AND SCULLY As he leans into her, putting his ear up to her mouth. As the softest sound comes out in Scully's frosty As she continues to suck air.
SCULLY: Hang on. I'm going to get you out of
MULDER: Hang on. I'm going to get you out of
VARIOUS SHOTS: Of the ice encasing the human forms sweating and CAMERA ADJUSTING UP TO REVEAL Mulder pulling Scully along in a fireman's carry. She is dressed now in Mulder's snow parka and the outer nylon pants he was wearing. Scully's legs are weak beneath her. Her body limp, but not lifeless. Mulder laboring to get her up the INTERIOR of the steep curving cylinder spoke, as the air fills with mist.
CORRIDOR: Scully's head pokes through now, as she's pushed through the opening that Mulder used earlier to get into the vaulted arena. Pushed in fits and starts until she's all the way through. Mulder now straining and squeezing to do the same on his own. The corridor is filled with heavy condensed mist now as Mulder finally slips out of the low passageway, trying to get his bearing now as he huddles low over Scully. Turning his attention to her as she COUGHS HOARSELY in some kind of acute spasm of pain but alive.
MULDER: We've got to keep moving.
SCULLY: ( weakly ) Where are we?
MULDER: You got me. But I think I know what they did with Jimmy Hoffa.
SCULLY: I can't.
SCULLY: ( barely a whisper ) I can't go any farther.
MULDER: Yes you can. You're going to make it,
MULDER: But she is unable to answer. Mulder hastening to unzip her/his jacket. To get to her neck and find a pulse.
MULDER: Mulder cannot find a pulse. Scully straining harder now as Mulder reaches his fingers into her mouth, clearing her passageway. Moving on top of her now, and pumping forcefully on her chest trying to get air into her. One - two - three. And putting his mouth down to hers ( FINALLY! ), breathing his life into her. Pulling away from her to see that he is unsuccessful at this that Scully is continuing to strain. Pumping her chest again
MULDER: You're not dying on me now godammit godammit godammit
RESUME MULDER: His hands going to a pocket on the inside of the jacket Scully is wearing his jacket finding again the syringe that he used on Scully. It is still partially full of vaccine. Mulder finding this, getting ready to use it when Scully's body suddenly comes back to life beneath him. Labored breaths which turn into a coughing spasm. Mulder breaths relievedly for a moment, watching Scully coughing, coming back to life. Her eyes trying to focus on him, finding him. Seeing his labored relief. The panic melting away.
SCULLY: ( weakly, pained whisper ) ( continued weak ) Had you big time.
SCULLY: ( continued weak ) Had you big time.
RESUME MULDER: Looking the other way down the corridor, seeing
MORE CREATURES: The slushy material that makes up the inner core spilling out with them as the creatures KICK out of their tombs.
RESUME MULDER: Lifting Scully up with all his strength he has left in him. He's got to get her overhead now, back up the venting that he slipped down from. She is weak and of little help. Mulder gets her propped up on his strength so that he can use the power of his legs to boost her toward the opening. Which puts him face to face with THE EMBRYONIC CREATURE. Its eye looking directly at him, blinking, before it goes into another FITFUL SPASM inside its host ANGLE DOWN FROM VENT Where Scully is boosted up TOWARD CAMERA. Her hands reaching feebly for something to grab onto. Finding a She utters something guttural, unintelligible as the next thrust up from Mulder gets her head and shoulders into the opening of the vent.
MULDER: Keep breathing, Scully.
RESUME MULDER: Beneath her, pushing with all his might. His hands under her shoes now, forcing her up into the vent like a rolled carpet into the rafters.
RESUME SCULLY: Struggling with her arms and elbows, barely conscious, but somehow able to manage herself forward.
RESUME MULDER: Pushing Scully up the last little way. Then reaching up to find a handhold for himself. Grabbing hold and lifting himself as one of his feet kicks at the ice where the creature he was just face to face with BURSTS from its icy pod. One hand, then the other shooting out of the ice where they have broken through the host. Ripping open the front of the body, including the man's face. Making a slimy, gaping tear in what was formerly Its hands grabbing at Mulder as he thrashes to free himself from it getting a grip. As Mulder struggles to pull himself up, fighting off the creature which he cannot see beneath him.
RESUME CREATURE: As it emerges from the ice, still grasping and TEARING at Mulder's legs with its claws. But as it BURSTS COMPLETELY from its place, Mulder is able to pull himself up and into the vent in one athletic movement.
MULDER: Scully you breathing?
RESUME SCULLY: Letting out another low, guttural sound which STRAINS out of her with each push forward.
MULDER: ( over the din ) We've got to run!
MULDER: Watches this then lays his head down on Scully's back. He is spent, at the brink of complete exhaustion. His whole body heaving. But now starting to shiver, and to lose consciousness. Scully's body is motionless beneath him, for a moment we might believe that this is the way it might end. Out here on the ice with Mulder and Scully freezing to death. A chill wind blows off the Antarctic plain, the same LOW RUMBLE, the only taint of silence in vastness of this literal end of the world. Then Scully coughs the same hoarse cough. She's alive. Struggling to consciousness. Her head lifting slightly, TURNING TO CAMERA. Her eyes blink open and she coughs again. Feeling Mulder's weight on top of her, unaware of his condition or even where she is.
SCULLY: ( weakly )
CASSIDY: . my official report is incomplete pending these new facts I'm being asked to reconcile. Agent Scully.
AGENT SCULLY: Sitting where she last sat, at the small table. The seat next to her conspicuously empty. Her face bears the signs of slight frostbite, somewhat healed. Her expression is even, her attitude composed, but her eyes are filled of dark, restrained defiance.
CASSIDY: .while there is direct evidence now that a federal agent may have been involved in the bombing. the other events you've laid down here seem too incredible on their own, and quite frankly implausible in their
SCULLY: What is it you find incredible?
CASSIDY: Well.where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
SCULLY: No, they don't.
