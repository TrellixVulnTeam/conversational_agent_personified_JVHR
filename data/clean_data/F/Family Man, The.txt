JACK: Sure there is. Kate looks around again, then she smiles. Kate rises, taking his hand. Jack takes her in his arms, swaying slowly in the limited amount of space, confident and self-assured.

JACK: Its wonderful. Kate laughs, nodding. A pause, then.
KATE: I think about it, too, Jack. I do. I think about the kind of person Id be if I hadnt married you. Its as if shes inside his head. They stay like this for a moment, looking into each other.

JACK: I dont think Id fight you on that one. Kate lifts her head and looks at him expectantly. They The mini-van passes a sign that reads, Welcome to Annie walking through the downstairs of the house, practicing her violin.its a noise bordering on MUSIC, but not quite. She walks into the kitchen where. Jack stands at the counter in his robe, reading the Newark Star Ledger and drinking a cup of coffee. He lowers the paper, watches Annie with a smile as she strolls through the room playing her violin badly.he goes back to his paper.
KATE: Have a good day. A smile from Jack as she pats him on the ass and sends him on his way.
JACK: For the money, theyre hands down the best radial we carry.

JACK: Peter Lassiter.
LASSITER: ( surprised ) Do I know you?
JACK: Not exactly. Ive seen you on CNBC. You look taller in real CUT TO: Jack leaning back in his chair, behind the desk of his cluttered, cramped office.
JACK: .truth is, Mintz was so busy timing his wifes breathing he didnt see that MedTech needed Global more than the other way around.

MINTZS ASSISTANT: ( seeing Lassiter ) Hes expecting you, Mr. Lassiter doesnt even slow down.
LASSITER: ( to Mintz ) Alan, this is Jack Campbell.the one I was telling you about. Mintz, a confident look on his face, gets up from the desk and goes to shake Jacks hand.
ALAN: Jack, of course. They shake hands.
JACK: ( appropriately Mr. Mintz.
ALAN: Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here.
JACK: ( re: play pen ) I can see that, Alan. A chuckle from Mintz.
ALAN: You have kids, Jack?
JACK: ( hesitating, then. ) Uh.actually, yes. Two. good ones. Another laugh from Mintz.
ALAN: Thats great. Why dont you have a seat? Jack nods, sits down on the plush sofa, Mintz and Lassiter take the chairs.

ALAN: Uh huh.one point seven. And what do you project for this year? Jack pauses, analyzing the situation.the patronizing questions, the smirk on Mintzs face.
JACK: Well, Alan, I think were gonna have a banner year. Sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account.
ALAN: Really. So youre projecting what, a tad over two million? A gleam in Jacks eye.
JACK: Thats right. And that would make us number one in our market. You mind if I stand? A raised eyebrow from Mintz. Mintz and Lassiter follow Jack with their eyes as he crosses the room to the desk, pours himself a glass of Look, I know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year. And I know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar Im not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
ALAN: Im not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
JACK: ( a confident chuckle ) Its okay, Alan. I get it. Im in your shoes, Im thinking exactly the same thing.but heres the thing. Business is business. Wall Street, Main Street, its all just a bunch of people getting up in the morning, trying to figure out how the hell theyre gonna send their kids to college. Its just Jacks confidence is throwing Mintz off, but Lassiter appears intrigued.
ALAN: Im sure you do.
LASSITER: ( intervening ) Lets let the man have his say. Mintz covers his embarrassment with a smile.
JACK: ( to Mintz ) Take you, for instance.
ALAN: ( defensive ) What about me?
JACK: You drink about sixteen Diet Cokes a day. Youre an excellent father, but you feel guilty about the time you spend away from home. You drink bourbon, but you offer your clients scotch. Jack looks around the office then back to Mintz.
LASSITER: He certainly has your number, Alan.
JACK: ( turning to Lassiter ) Youre a little tougher, A raised eyebrow from Lassiter, but hes game.
LASSITER: ( smiling proudly ) Thats easy. Youve seen my car.
JACK: ( a chuckle ) Okay.you smoke Hoyo de Monterreys. Youre a scotch man, single malt, not because its trendy but because youve been doing it for forty years, and you stay with what works. You have two great loves in your life, your horses and this company. You wept openly the day the Dow hit ten thousand. Lassiters impressed.

Give me a chance, Peter, I wont let you Lassiter returns Jacks gaze with equal intensity. In a moment, he turns to Mintz.
LASSITER: ( to Mintz ) Alan, why dont you show Jack around a bit.
ALAN: Id love to.

JACK: God, you really are different, arent you. I mean.wow.I am Now its Mintzs turn to look quizzical.
ALAN: I dont think youre hearing Oh, Im hearing you, Alan. Thats not the problem. The problem is that what you think is yours, is really mine. And I dont care how low on the totem pole I start, I will get it back. So do yourself a favor and dont get too attached to that view because sometime soon, maybe very soon, you and your French country antiques, your chintz sofa, and your little play pen are gonna be moving out of that office. Jack smiles at Alan one more time, then turns.

JACK: This place is a perk, A perk for what?
KATE: A perk for what?
JACK: A company called P.K. Lassiter and Associates Investment House uses it to attract new Kates confused.
KATE: What are you talking about, Jack?
JACK: Im going into arbitrage, honey. Turns out I have a knack for it. Ill be making two hundred grand a year plus a hefty bonus and thats just to start. And, we can live in this apartment practically rent free for as long as we want. Jack measures her reaction. Its not good.
KATE: Are you out of your mind?
JACK: I dont think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey. Well put Annie and Josh in private Annie goes to a great Im talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate.
KATE: Annie goes to a great Im talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate.
JACK: Im talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate.
KATE: Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
JACK: This is New York City, its like the needy people capital of the world. Those Jersey clients of yours arent a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get I cant believe you want to move back into the city. I thought the reason we left was because we didnt want to raise the kids here?
KATE: ( cutting him off ) I cant believe you want to move back into the city. I thought the reason we left was because we didnt want to raise the kids here?
JACK: No, this is the center of the universe. If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else? Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
KATE: ( cutting him off ) Jacks starting to struggle.
JACK: Look, Im detecting a kind of funky tension here.We dont have to live in this apartment. I dont need this.Ill commute.Ill drive to Jacks back on his heels.seeing his dream picked In traffic? Its over an hour each way? Thats almost three hours a day. When are you going to see the kids? Hes frustrated.he pauses a moment to gather himself. Then.
KATE: In traffic? Its over an hour each way? Thats almost three hours a day. When are you going to see the kids? Hes frustrated.he pauses a moment to gather himself. Then.
JACK: Kate. Youre not understanding me. Im talking about a great life. A perfect life. Everything we pictured when we were young. The whole package. You said it yourself, life has thrown us surprises, and so we made sacrifices. But now I can finally get us back on track. A sad chuckle from Kate.
KATE: Then get a goddamn snow Jacks taken aback by the intensity of her tone.
JACK: Look, youre making this into something its not. This isnt a referendum on our lives, Kate. Its a step forward. Dont you see? Im talking about us finally having a life other people envy. Silence. Kate looks him in the eye  a deep, piercing They already do envy us, Kate picks up her bag and walks out of the apartment.
KATE: They already do envy us, Kate picks up her bag and walks out of the apartment.
JACK: Very nice. What is it?
ANNIE: Mary Had A Little Lamb.
JACK: Ah. A classic. Annie starts PLAYING again as Jack looks at the dresser. She has 20 or so family photos lined up and down its sides. Jack studies them.in every one Jacks face is totally contented. Jack studies them, looking at his own face. Annie lowers the bow, watching him. Jack turns to her.
JACK: From London to New York.? I came back. Then.a NOISE. Jack turns and sees Kate walking into the doorway, standing there.She sees Jack holding the Pan Am ticket sleeve.
KATE: Our finest moment, A quizzical look from Jack.
ANNIE: ( whispering in I knew youd come back.
JACK: What are you doing?
ANNIE: ( a curious look ) Ringing my bell. On Jacks anxious face.
JACK: Four ninety nine?! Its just salt for gods sake. On the entrance to the store.the door opens, a YOUNG GIRL, 17, enters, an average suburban teenager. She glances at a fashion magazine, picks up a package of gum. From the POV of the cashier, we see the girl approach the counter. On Jack, crouched down in the aisle. He grabs a bag of salt from the shelf, when.
JACK: Then.the color drains from Jacks face.
CASH: Jack, its good to see Cash reaches into the register, taking out change for ten dollars.he hands the girl $9.35.
JACK: Im not going back. The girl hesitates.Cash turns to her.
CASH: ( to the girl ) Everything okay.? She looks at him, a moment of decision, then.
