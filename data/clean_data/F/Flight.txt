FLIGHT: Written by John Gatins
NICOLE: ( as the phone rings ) Don't pick up.don't pick up. don't pick up.
VOICE: For the love of Christ! Look.just hold.HOLD ON. He aggressively drains the last four inches of beer from a clear bottle and cracks the last fresh one that bobs in the hotel ice bucket. The naked, YOUNG WOMAN bends over to pick up her clothes. We witness her ass as a tanned glass vase with a perfect crack down the middle. Whip smiles, taking it all in.
WHIP: ( into the phone ) I've been up since the crack 'a dawn. What check? Tuition? How much does it cost to go there? The YOUNG WOMAN has re-lit the last half of a joint and is puffing it to life as WHIP is beckoning with his large hands. The YOUNG WOMAN, looking more like a stripper by the second, hands the joint to WHIP who takes a masterful drag. WHIP shakes his head in violent disapproval to what he hears on the phone. He exhales in anger as he shouts into the phone.
YOUNG WOMAN: Was that your wife?
WHIP: That was my ex-wife. But you Trina, you could be my second or third wife if you'd just C'mere. The YOUNG WOMAN we now know as TRINA smiles seductively.
TRINA: Whip, don't even joke about that. Our flight's at 9, let's hit it. TRINA is still naked but she holds a navy blue skirt and a white blouse as she hands WHIP his pants. WHIP can't help but pat that perfect ass as TRINA tries to skip away. ON THE RADIO We hear the opening bars of a familiar rock anthem.JOE COCKER's "I'm Feeling Alright"
WHIP: Yeah, I'm feelin' a little light- headed. I shoulda ate somethin'. WHIP leans over the motel table, picks up a soda straw that's been cut in half. He efficiently sniffs up a line of coke.
WHIP: Son of a bitch! Whip shakes the rain out of his shoe as he continues up the INT. ORLANDO AIRPORT TERMINAL - JETWAY DAY WHIP enters the jetway from the exterior door at the entrance of the plane. TRINA is greeting a MAN and his SON.
WHIP: Morning Miss Marquez.
TRINA: Morning Captain Whitaker. WHIP waits as TRINA politely parts the stream of folks to allow WHIP to enter the plane.
MARGARET: Captain Whitaker, that sky gonna hold? You're not gonna make me spend another night in Orlando?
WHIP: Don't worry, Margaret I'm gonna get you home for your prayer meeting at.what is it? Jesus Christ Superstar 27th Baptist King Church? TRINA and CAMELIA SATOU, the other flight attendant, laugh.
MARGARET: That's right, Christ the King First Baptist Church on Hazel and 9th Street. And I'm still saving you a seat next to me. Offer stands.come on down.
WHIP: One of these nights, Margaret, I'm comin'. You hold my seat. The girls laugh at the familiar exchange.
WHIP: G'morning. Walk around is complete. Whip pulls his emergency oxygen mask off the bulkhead and takes a huge hit.
EVANS ): You want a hit?
EVANS: No thank you sir.
WHIP: ( tries to break the chill ) My pleasure to share the chair with ya'. Didn't we fly together. EVANS lets him hang.
EVANS: No sir, not that I remember. Ken Evans, sir.
WHIP: Call me Whip.
EVANS: Yes sir. WHIP studies this little Bible Thumper for a second before.
WHIP: ( calls to the galley ) Sweetie, will you get me a coffee, black, lots of sugar. And some aspirin. You want something?
EVANS: ( looks to Margaret ) No ma'am. Thank you.
WHIP: Then let's push. I got a great `on time' record.
EVANS: Yes sir, you gottit. And how you feeling today, sir? WHIP focuses on EVANS, trying to read into that statement.
WHIP: Tired, sir. But, this is a quick turn for me. Ten turns in three days. Off tomorrow. MARGARET returns with the coffee, placing it down near WHIP's chair on an airline cocktail napkin.
MARGARET: Here's your coffee and the final manifest. 102 souls on board.
WHIP: Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're a life saver. And Margaret gettem' tucked in, we're ready to WHIP goes to the head. MARGARET and EVANS exchange a look.
NICOLE: He sniffs a quick line and gets up to kiss her, she turns her cheek avoiding the coke-frozen kiss.
KIP: Nicole, this is Tiki Pot. He's my partner in this new series, he knows a lot about porn.
NICOLE: Kip I need 2 grams of "h."
KIP: Tiki and I are trying to put the narrative back in porn. Our Desdemona hasn't shown yet. ( a great idea hatches. ) You should play Desdemona. FUCK YEAH! You got that fair skin. KIP is flirting, seeing if she'll consider it.
NICOLE: Desdemona? What the fuck? TIKI does a line and comes up babbling.
TIKI POT: She do anal, two thousand, one I don't do porn, Kip. Just lemme see the "h."
NICOLE: I don't do porn, Kip. Just lemme see the "h."
KIP: Just listen, we're doing an Othello theme where the Moor finds you in bed with your nurse and-
NICOLE: He fucks me in the ass?
KIP: Well.yeah. We're giving a whole new meaning to the "beast with two backs." That's actually a title we're toying with.'beast with two backs' or Hole-thelo or Butt Hole- thelo.would you be up for it?
TIKI POT: College kid, very clean.BRETT?! A tall thin kid joins them. He wears a Moorish Headdress and has a bath towel wrapped around his waist.
NICOLE: Fuck you Tiki, you put that in your ass and call me in the morning. Kip, have I ever done that shit for you? Never. Asshole. NICOLE walks away. KIP follows her.at the door.
KIP: Nic.sorry, we're tweaked, okay baby girl. Hey, c'mon you wanna stay and shoot some stills for me, you're pics are awesome. And what's going on with you? You were clean for a while and. ( she begins to cry ) Sweetheart, don't cry.
NICOLE: I just need a little to smoke. ( flashes the cash ) I've got 100. KIP pulls a small tin foil square from his vest pocket.
KIP: No, keep your money, okay? But, Nicole, this is the Taliban baby, very big time. It will take you I can handle it.
NICOLE: I can handle it.
NICOLE: I'm just gonna smoke it. I haven't done needles in weeks.
KIP: Okay, no needles and take a little coke and if you start going down just whiff a little. Okay? I wanna see you. KIP hands her a tiny baggy of coke. He kisses her cheek.
WHIP: Thanks junior. EVANS looks out at the rain.
EVANS: Looks pretty ugly, sir.
WHIP: A little rain never hurt anybody. We're not made of sugar. What's the RVR?
EVANS: Half a mile. Right at minimums. Wind's gusting to 29. 30 is our crosswind max.
WHIP: I know what our crosswind max is. Tellem were good to go at the end. EVANS just stares at WHIP.
GROUND CONTROL: ( ON RADIO )
EVANS: Orlando ground. SouthJet 227 will be ready to go at the end. WHIP stares forward, not looking at EVANS.
MARGARET: Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has turned on the seat-belt sign. Please be sure your seat-belts are securely fastened, and all carry-on items are safely stored in the over- head bin, or under the seat in front of you. Also, all personal electronic devices must be switched off, at this time. Today's flight time to Atlanta should be 52 minutes. Flight attendants please take your seats. 16 TRINA straps into her jump-seat. 16
EVANS: ( reading the check-list ) Elevator trim - set. Flaps, One, two, three - set. Radios - set.
TOWER: ( ON RADIO )
EVANS: ( keys the mic ) Cleared for take off, SouthJet 227. Whip pushes the throttles and the engines SCREAM as they spool up to full thrust. After a beat, he releases the INT. PASSENGER CABIN - DAY The passengers are pressed into their seats like blades of grass as the breeze of the plane's momentum moves them towards flight. The main lights in the cabin go out and the small glow of the aisle lights lead us back to the cockpit.
WHIP: It's like a video game, right? WHIP laughs and turns to his copilot. EVANS is visibly nervous as he begins the take-off check.
EVANS: Airspeed's alive, both sides. Engine instruments are in the green.100 knots crosscheck. The JR-88 fishtails as the main gear begins to hydroplane.
WHIP: Yep, nothing like a little 30 knot cross wind to exercise that sphincter muscle. Evans is jostled violently.
EVANS: That's wind shear! A micro burst! Whip's eyes are focused on the end of the runway. The RED THRESHOLD LIGHTS are approaching fast. The plane is not lifting off.
WHIP: Just watch my airspeed! C.U. The airspeed indicator reads 145.
EVANS: Now the air speed indicator climbs to 160.
WHIP: Yeehaw! Ride `em cowboy.
EVANS: Orlando Departure.SouthJet 227, climbing out of 2500 for 5 thousand, runway heading.
ATC: ( ON RADIO )
EVANS: Left to 170. Climb, maintain niner EVANS quickly dials the heading and altitude into the auto- I don't want the auto-pilot. I'm What's your ride like, SouthJet
WHIP: I don't want the auto-pilot. I'm What's your ride like, SouthJet
ATC: ( ON RADIO )
WHIP: Ah, Departure, we've got some rough chop here. I'd say moderate to. WHUMP!! The plane hits a severe bump! EVAN's headset turns sideways and he quickly rights it. WHIP chokes back a nervous chuckle.
TRINA: ( to a passenger ) This happened last week, always bumpy outta Orlando. Right Cam? MARGARET grabs the cabin mic and addresses the passengers.
MARGARET: Ladies and Gentlemen, the captain has asked that until we clear this air you stay seated with your seat belts fastened. Thank you.
WHIP: ( SINGING )
ATC: ( ON RADIO )
EVANS: Copy, Center.
WHIP: Gottit Skippy. I'm just tryin' to get birdie here outta this wind bowl.What did they clear us to?
EVANS: We're cleared to Flight Level one- THE PLANE TAKES ANOTHER VIOLENT DIP EVANS' headset flies off. His tie and all the loose equipment and coffee cups are thrown to the ground.
WHIP: Goddamnit! Enough of this shit! WHIP pushes the yoke forward. The plane pitches downward.
EVANS: What are you doing!?
WHIP: Leveling off.
EVANS: WHIP points to the MFD screen.
WHIP: See that sliver of blue sitting between those two ugly bastards? C.U. MFD screen: A narrow line of blue is visible between the two monstrous convective cells.
EVANS: ( into his mic ) Center. This is SouthJet 227, We need to divert 30 degrees right.
WHIP: For weather.
EVANS: ( into his mic ) .for weather.
ATC: SouthJet 227, this is Jacksonville Center. 30 Degrees, right, approved. Report back on course.
EVANS: Report back on course. WHIP banks the plane to the right. Suddenly the plane falls 200 feet in 2 seconds. A huge air pocket pulls the rug out from under the JR-88. From the cockpit we can hear the passengers scream. EVANS holds on to his headset.
WHIP: He can't help you now, brother. WHIP remains cool as he rides more bad air. The plane now bounces rapidly over a non-stop succession of speed bumps.
EVANS: Why are you leveling off, sir?
WHIP: I'd like to spend less time in this shitty air, Kenny. Is that alright with you? WHIP pushes the 17-year-old Jackson-Ridgefield JR-88 directly into a huge black cloud. He begins to dip the nose towards the ground.
EVANS: We're approaching maximum airspeed!
WHIP: Fucking right! I'm gonna need some speed to punch through this crap.
EVANS: You're over-speeding!
WHIP: Not yet!! The AIRSPEED INDICATOR moves from GREEN right up to the YELLOW line. WHIP banks the plane steeply to the right. From the cabin we HEAR the passengers SCREAM! Now ATC comes on the radio.
ATC: ( ON RADIO )
WHIP: Tell `em we're climbing.
EVANS: ( scared and lying badly ) Center.uh.SouthJet 227 is leaving niner thousand.for Flight Level 180.
ATC: ( ON RADIO )
WHIP: You're useless Evans, shit! ( keys the radio )
ATC: ( ON RADIO )
EVANS: ( TERRIFIED )
WHIP: I'm right on the line Kenny. Right on the line. WHIP starts to hum the Joe Cocker song again as he cranes his head up close to the windscreen looking intently at the dark sky.
EVANS: Glad that's over. WHIP, however, is very shaky and beaded with sweat.
WHIP: How tall are we?
EVANS: 16 thousand. That was incredible Ken, turn us north and take us home. Your plane. EVANS looks at him and nods.
WHIP: Ken, turn us north and take us home. Your plane. EVANS looks at him and nods.
EVANS: My plane.
WHIP: ( picks up the phone ) Margaret, I'm coming out. WHIP hangs up, puts on his pilot hat and exits the cockpit.
FRAN: Where you been Nicole? She is scared and pissed by his invasion of her space.
NICOLE: Fuck! Fran.get out.
FRAN: You're like a little ghost. I never know when you're here.
NICOLE: Get the fuck out Fran! She grabs the full-bodied 35 MM camera from him.
FRAN: As the building manager I have a legal right to enter an apartment if I believe the occupant is unwell. Especially if said occupant is not current on her He takes a slimy step towards her. She steps away.
NICOLE: Fran, please just gimme a minute. Get out. I have the rent. I will bring it down to you. Just let me You could just bring the check down now, use my shower. I got good water pressure. You know that. FRAN leans against the door frame, trying to strike a seductive pose. NICOLE smiles and holds up her camera.
FRAN: You could just bring the check down now, use my shower. I got good water pressure. You know that. FRAN leans against the door frame, trying to strike a seductive pose. NICOLE smiles and holds up her camera.
NICOLE: You're in the perfect light Fran. ( he smiles, preening ) Back up a little.little more. FRAN steps outside and on to the landing.
NICOLE: ( SOTTO )
WHIP: Folks, this is Captain Whitaker. If you look up, I'm here in the galley. I will wave to you. WHIP steps into the aisle so the passengers can see him. WHIP waves with a calm smile that would put anyone at ease.
NICOLE: Oh man. She puts her arms out at her sides, euphoria. A slow, sloppy smile breaks across her face. She exhales slowly. She reaches for the now burning cigarette when the second wave of heavy drugs hits. NICOLE looks up with fear. NICOLE ( cont'd ) ( CONT'D ) Oh no, oh no, oh no. She reaches for the little bag of coke that KIP gave her. Next she grabs her phone, flipping it open. As she tries to dial it, she crumbles to her knees. NICOLE somewhat controls her fall to the ground, but her eyes are fading. The little bag of coke falls from her fingers. There's no way to stem the tide of the oncoming overdose. NICOLE's arms stretch out in a frozen reach as her body sinks to the floor. On her back like a girl making angels in the snow as her eyelids flutter, she slips away. We hear a pounding on the door. FRAN is on the other side.
MARGARET: How long has Sleeping Beauty been EVANS maintains a military posture as he monitors the plane's progress. The flight is smooth and the sky appears clear.
EVANS: ( looks at his watch ) 26 minutes. We're going to start descending any second now.
MARGARET: Well, I guess you'll need to The radio interrupts.
ATC: SouthJet 227, Atlanta Center. Descend and maintain Flight Level 30 thousand.
EVANS: Descend and maintain 30 thousand. Evans dials 30,000 into the auto-pilot, but just as he rolls the thumb switch to the "Descend" position.
WHIP: The fuck was that? Evans grabs his yoke and pulls.
EVANS: The stabilizer feels really stiff.
WHIP: Don't force it. EVANS does, we HEAR a big mechanical SNAP.
MARGARET: ( referring to the noise ) That came from the back!
EVANS: I have very little trim control Margaret, get everybody strapped in Margaret runs to the PA, leaving the cockpit door open.
WHIP: Margaret, get everybody strapped in Margaret runs to the PA, leaving the cockpit door open.
EVANS: It's pulling right. Hard!
WHIP: Shit! It's locked up, ease up on the trim don't.
EVANS: ( PANIC )
WHIP: We lost our hydraulics! WHIP pulls on his headset and keys his mic.
ATC: SouthJet 227, Atlanta Center. Understand you've lost hydraulics and stabilizer?
WHIP: ( TO EVANS )
WHOOOAAAAA!!!!: The plane starts to bank to the right, WHIP puts his hand against the wing-window to stay in his seat. EVANS grabs his harness with both hands. The passengers shriek with terror.
ATC: SouthJet 227, do you wish to declare an emergency!?
MARGARET: Everyone's belted in. Are we going The plane suddenly pitches up, begins to roll, and dives Get belted in, everyone belt in. Brace position! MARGARET rushes to the bench in the galley. Whip grabs his yoke and pulls. The plane inches up.
WHIP: Get belted in, everyone belt in. Brace position! MARGARET rushes to the bench in the galley. Whip grabs his yoke and pulls. The plane inches up.
EVANS: Your plane. Whips keeps back pressure on his yoke.
ATC: SouthJet 227, say your condition. Whip continues to give orders to Evans.
WHIP: We need drag. Throw out everything we've got. Speed brakes. Gear. ( keys his mic ) Uh, Center we're in a dive.lost vertical control.
ATC: SouthJet 227, Roger. Evans deploys the landing gear and applies the speed brakes. The wind ROARS as the gear doors drop. The airframe shakes and rumbles violently.
WHIP: ( TO EVANS )
EVANS: Gear's down. I don't think hydraulics is the problem.
WHIP: Throw out the flaps.
EVANS: Too fast for flaps.
WHIP: We need to start dumping fuel. Evans hesitates.
ATC: ( ON RADIO )
WHIP: ( keys his mic ) Atlanta. This is SouthJet 227. We are in an uncontrolled dive, descending out of.shit I don't ( calls to Whip ) 21 thousand!
EVANS: ( calls to Whip ) 21 thousand!
WHIP: ( into his mic ) .21 thousand. We are declaring an emergency! We are dumping fuel! We have a jammed stabilizer.or something. We need a block of altitude to work the problem.and a heading to the nearest airport! ( YELLS to Evans ) I'm starting to lose it! The yoke pressure pulls Whip hard against his harness.
ATC: SouthJet 227. Hartsfield-Jackson International is 10 O'clock and 20 miles from your present position. Maintain block altitude, Flight Level 10 thousand through Flight Level 20 thousand. Turn left heading 260.
WHIP: ( KEYS MIC )
EVANS: We're still fast. The yoke is ripping away from Whip's hands.
WHIP: DO IT! 30 percent! Evans dumps in the flaps. The JR-88 slows dramatically and balloons up.
ATC: ( ON RADIO ) ( KEYS MIC )
WHIP: ( KEYS MIC )
EVANS: I got it.
WHIP: Pull it up, turn it clockwise, push it back down. Evans does exactly that, then pulls back on his yoke Nothing! No control!
EVANS: Nothing! No control!
WHIP: Goddamn it!! Once again, the plane pitches into a dive. Whip strains to hold on.
EVANS: I can't reach it. Evans moves to release his harness, but Whip stops him.
WHIP: No! Don't! Stay strapped in! ( calls over his shoulder ) Margaret! Margaret! Margaret tumbles into the cockpit, catching herself on Whip's chair. She's crying.
MARGARET: Oh God, Whip. What's happening?!
WHIP: Get strapped into the jump-seat. I need your help. Margaret opens the jump-seat and starts to pull on her harness. Throughout the scene she is struggling with her Margaret, see that red lever on the floor next to my chair? The one that says, Manual Control?
MARGARET: On the count of three you pull it up, turn it clockwise, then push it back down. OK? You ready? With tears streaming down her cheeks, she gives Whip a brave Here we go. One, two. Whip releases back pressure from his yoke, pushing it forward the plane noses downward 20 degrees!
WHIP: On the count of three you pull it up, turn it clockwise, then push it back down. OK? You ready? With tears streaming down her cheeks, she gives Whip a brave Here we go. One, two. Whip releases back pressure from his yoke, pushing it forward the plane noses downward 20 degrees!
EVANS: OH NO! Now, ATC comes on the radio.
OH NO!: Now, ATC comes on the radio.
ATC: SouthJet 227, Hartsfield-Jackson is eleven o'clock and niner miles. I see you below 10,000. How are you ( keys his mic ) Not good. You got anything closer? We're in a rapid dive here.
WHIP: ( keys his mic ) Not good. You got anything closer? We're in a rapid dive here.
ATC: Roger, SouthJet 227. Uh.Clayton County is 2 miles at your 4 Negative. We're too high.we can't pitch for glide. We have no stabilizer control.
WHIP: Negative. We're too high.we can't pitch for glide. We have no stabilizer control.
ATC: Copy, SouthJet 227. The plane continues to drop, increasing its nose-down attitude and speed. WHIP pushes both of his feet forward, stretching his body to get leverage as we can see him pulling on the yoke, trying to get the plane out of the dive it's in. Evans is starting to lose it.
EVANS: Oh Lord, we're descending at 4,700 feet per minute, out of 7,000. I
WHIP: OK! Here's what we're going to do!
EVANS: Trim down?! What are you gonna do?! Whip takes Margaret's hand and puts it on the throttle When I ask for power, push both of these forward. Got it?
WHIP: When I ask for power, push both of these forward. Got it?
MARGARET: Say "I love you Trevor."
WHIP: Say "I love you Trevor."
EVANS: You mean trim up?! Right? You want me to trim up?
MARGARET: The black box.
WHIP: The black box.
MARGARET: I love you Trevor. Be a good boy. Mommy loves you.
EVANS: What are we doing?! Why would I trim down?!
WHIP: We're gonna roll it. Ready? Here we go. I've got control.
EVANS: ( TERRIFIED )
WHIP: Just a little barrel roll. Don't panic. Relax. Let it roll. WHIP's body is fully extended as he pulls back on the yoke and turns into a steep bank.
EVANS, FLAPS!: FLAPS UP! MARGARET FULL POWER! EVANS, TRIM US! GEAR UP! The G-force of the roll presses Evans away from the console.
EVANS: FLAPS UP! MARGARET FULL POWER! EVANS, TRIM US! GEAR UP! The G-force of the roll presses Evans away from the console.
FLAPS UP!: MARGARET FULL POWER! EVANS, TRIM US! GEAR UP! The G-force of the roll presses Evans away from the console.
WHIP: MARGARET FULL POWER! EVANS, TRIM US! GEAR UP! The G-force of the roll presses Evans away from the console.
EVANS: I CAN'T REACH THE GEAR! Margaret! Can you reach it? Margaret bends forward and pulls the lever.
WHIP: Margaret! Can you reach it? Margaret bends forward and pulls the lever.
EVANS: 3,000.I think.
WHIP: Let it roll. I got it! Whip quickly retracts the speed brakes, then PUSHES HIS YOKE FULL FORWARD! The clumsy liner does a slow, ungraceful roll.
NICOLE: Being rushed out of her apartment on a stretcher. The TWO PARAMEDICS and Fran ( the landlord ) instinctively duck as the jet SCREAMS over.
FRAN: ( at the sight of the jet ) Jesus Christ! What the Fuck!?
EVANS: Oh Lord Jesus! We're inverted! WHIP reaches over and pulls the throttles back. He suddenly seems strangely calm, comfortable with his fate.
WHIP: We're level. We can maintain altitude like this.
ATC: SouthJet 227, Atlanta Center. I see your position 4 and a half miles southeast of the airport. Descending out of 1,800. Are you
OK?: It takes Whip a second to find the mic key on his inverted There's a very pregnant pause.
WHIP: Uh, Atlanta.we're inverted. There's a very pregnant pause.
ATC: Uh, SouthJet 227.say again sir. Did you say inverted? EVANS seems calmed by WHIP'S workaday attitude about their insane tragedy. But suddenly.
EVANS: WE'RE LOSING OIL PRESSURE! PUMP FAILURE. BOTH ENGINES! WE HEAR A HORRIBLE, METALLIC GRINDING SOUND as the engines become oil-deprived.
WHIP: We're flying!
EVANS: FIRE IN THE LEFT ENGINE! PUT IT OUT! Evans pulls the Fire Bottle handle. Whip BARKS at air traffic control.
WHIP: PUT IT OUT! Evans pulls the Fire Bottle handle. Whip BARKS at air traffic control.
ATC: 227, three miles, and one o'clock.
WHIP: ( into his mic ) We're not gonna make that!
ATC: Roger, SouthJet 227.
EVANS: WE'RE LOSING THE LEFT ENGINE! WE'RE COMING BACK OVER! EVANS, WHEN I START THE ROLL, THROW EVERYTHING BACK OUT! THE NERVE-WRACKING ALARMS CONTINUE TO SOUND! FIRE IN THE RIGHT! Evans deploys the right engine Fire Bottle.
WHIP: WE'RE COMING BACK OVER! EVANS, WHEN I START THE ROLL, THROW EVERYTHING BACK OUT! THE NERVE-WRACKING ALARMS CONTINUE TO SOUND! FIRE IN THE RIGHT! Evans deploys the right engine Fire Bottle.
BACK OUT!: THE NERVE-WRACKING ALARMS CONTINUE TO SOUND! Evans deploys the right engine Fire Bottle.
EVANS: FIRE IN THE RIGHT! Evans deploys the right engine Fire Bottle.
WHIP: ( into his mic )
ATC: ( ON RADIO )
EVANS: WE LOST THE LEFT ENGINE! We have enough speed to fly!
WHIP: We have enough speed to fly!
EVANS: WE'RE LOSING POWER IN THE RIGHT! HERE WE GO! WHIP PULLS HARD ON HIS YOKE THE PLANE SLIPS SIDEWAYS AS IT STARTS TO RIGHT ITSELF. Whip yanks back the throttles!
WHIP: HERE WE GO! WHIP PULLS HARD ON HIS YOKE THE PLANE SLIPS SIDEWAYS AS IT STARTS TO RIGHT ITSELF. Whip yanks back the throttles!
ATC: SouthJet 227, altitude 500 indicated, descending. Do you We follow WHIP's eye line that takes us off the control panel and to the windshield. THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD WE SEE the landscape and the church steeple getting closer and closer.
WHIP: MARGARET, POWER!!!! EVANS pushes the power to full thrust AND THE PLANE FINISHES
MARGARET, POWER!!!!: EVANS pushes the power to full thrust AND THE PLANE FINISHES
ITS ROLL!: THE PASSENGERS HOWL! INT. MAIN CABIN GALLEY SAME TIME TRINA is still struggling to strap herself in to her jumpseat. The plane rolls! She sees Camelia. P.O.V. Camelia is tossed across a row of SCREAMING TRINA loses her grip and is violently thrown against the galley wall! Like a rag doll, CAMELIA is hurled down the cabin aisle as the plane plummets! Trina slides across the galley floor and CRACKS her head on the jumpseat.
EVANS: WE LOST ALL POWER! An unnerving quiet descends over the passenger cabin. The only SOUND is the wind RUSHING past the air-frame.
WHIP: ( to himself, incredulous ) Are we gliding?
WHIP: TRIM IT! CLOSE ON THE TRIM WHEEL WHIP SPINS IT "TRIM UP" PITCH FOR GLIDE! THROUGH THE WINDSCREEN THE BEAN FIELD RUSHES UP AT US. CLOSE ON WHIP BRACE! BRACE FOR IMPAC. ALL SOUND FADES AWAY AS THE SCREEN BLEEDS HOT WHITE IN GRAPHIC SLOW-MOTION THE INSTRUMENT PANEL CRUMPLES AND COLLAPSES AROUND WHIP And in a final, ironic, cosmic gesture

WHIP'S POV: WE SEE Whip's lower torso being pulled from the wreckage There is swirling SMOKE AND DUST, SMALL FIRES
WHIP'S POV: LOOKING UP at the sky WE SEE black, oily SMOKE billowing across the shattered church steeple WE GLIMPSE PEOPLE rushing past, some are wearing white flowing robes
WHIP'S POV: LOOKING UP at the ceiling of an ambulance TWO EMTS are urgently attending to him
WHIP: Charlie Anderson. CHARLIE ANDERSON is a late 50's former military pilot who carries that familiar air of Texas comfort and entitlement.
CHARLIE: How you feelin' Whip? Initial reports look like you pulled some move up there, kid. You saved a lot of lives. WHIP is moved by the first realization of survival.
WHIP: How many? CHARLIE moves close to deliver the news.
CHARLIE: 102 souls on board including the flight crew, and 96 of them survived the crash. Six people died. 2 crew, 4 passengers.
WHIP: 4 passengers. Are the rest badly hurt? Who'd we lose on the crew? A NURSE enters the room. CHARLIE nods to her.
CHARLIE: Listen, protocol is the NTSB has to make the first contact with you and the agent is here. Let me go get CHARLIE ducks out of the room. WHIP is alone and still getting his bearings. He goes to scratch his head and catches sight of his left hand. It's swollen and sore his wrist is bandaged with a splint-brace. He now looks at both of his hands in wonder. WHIP hears a muffled conversation that gets clearer as do the images of MANY PEOPLE entering the room. A POLICE OFFICER accompanies a DOCTOR and TWO NTSB AGENTS. An NTSB AGENT holds a small voice recorder towards WHIP.
DOCTOR: I'm Doctor Kenan and the good news is that you are in good condition. You did suffer a concussion which is the reason you have a bit of blurred vision and a headache. You have numerous lacerations around your left eye. We're going to leave the patch on for a few days as a precaution. But it seems your eye is OK. MRI's show strained tendons in your left knee and ankle but you didn't break any bones.
WHIP: I remember everything until the WHIP's voice is failing him as his throat is sore and dry.
WHIP: Who on the crew died?
WHIP: I knew Trina Marquez. We spent some time together.
CHARLIE: Apparently she wasn't strapped in. A survivor reported that she was assisting a kid. CHARLIE tries to put a reassuring hand on WHIP's shoulder.
WHIP: How's Margaret Thomason?
CHARLIE: ( checks his notes ) Broken collar bone, cuts, banged up, but she's okay. She's here too. Ken Evans your copilot took a bad shot to the head. They're keepin' him in a coma to let the brain swelling go down. He's listed as critical, but we feel good about him. He's gonna be WHIP lets that information land as his head is swirling.
WHIP: Charlie, why are you here?
CHARLIE: I'm flying a desk now. I'm a regional rep for the IAP.
WHIP: You're the rep for the pilots' I'm one of a few union reps for the southeast. When your plane went down all the reps got a page and since I know you I shot my hand up and said I wanted to come and be the first face you'd see.
CHARLIE: I'm one of a few union reps for the southeast. When your plane went down all the reps got a page and since I know you I shot my hand up and said I wanted to come and be the first face you'd see.
WHIP: I'm glad it's you. WHIP starts to weep as he needs to begin the long process of expressing this trauma.
CHARLIE: It's good to see you too, Cowboy. You're gonna be okay. We're gonna take care of you. That's my job. WHIP nods as he wipes his eyes on his heavily bandaged hand.
WHIP: Yeah, Knuckles.
CHARLIE: Yeah, how old's he now?
WHIP: Wow, you weren't even married when we flew for Delta. We're dinosaurs, Whip. Do you want me to reach out to Deana and see if she and Will want to come? Any family you want here, we'll get them here, WHIP thinks about his long since fractured family.
CHARLIE: Wow, you weren't even married when we flew for Delta. We're dinosaurs, Whip. Do you want me to reach out to Deana and see if she and Will want to come? Any family you want here, we'll get them here, WHIP thinks about his long since fractured family.
WHIP: No, I'll call her.
CHARLIE: Speaking of which, I have your phone and some of your personal effects from the plane. CHARLIE has a zip-locked bag with his phone, keys, sunglasses and wallet. WHIP looks at them, odd to see them encased in Your clothes are toast. Do you need me to get you some stuff?
WHIP: No, I'm okay. I'll take care of I'm gonna head out, let you get some rest. I'm coming back. You'll see plenty of me. CHARLIE hands WHIP his card.
CHARLIE: I'm gonna head out, let you get some rest. I'm coming back. You'll see plenty of me. CHARLIE hands WHIP his card.
WHIP: Thanks Charlie, I really. ( Whip begins to crack ) It means a lot to me that you came.
CHARLIE: Okay. Get some rest now.
WHIP: Charlie, that plane was fucked.
CHARLIE: I know. The way you landed that plane was nothing short of a WHIP nods trying to pull it together. CHARLIE pats WHIP's shoulder before he leaves. WHIP sits up and pulls his phone from the plastic bag. Dials, waits.
WHIP: Harling.Harling.yeah, it's Whip. I'm in a hospital in South Atlanta.what? You know where I am? Okay well fuck.yeah, I'm okay. What? Well, I'm looking to get outta here.hopefully tomorrow. Yeah. But, listen, I need you to bring me something to I don't know clothes and smokes, I really need smokes. Tee shirt, sweat pants..Harling? I'll put you on the visiting list. Yeah.and smokes. Just be low key, no fucking around, Harling. Cigarettes. Okay? I need cigarettes. Yeah. Good. WHIP closes his eyes and exhales. He now stares at the foot of the bed for a long, long moment. WHIP squeezes his eyes shut tight holding back tears. Then quietly, as if whispering a prayer.
HARLING MAYS: I'm on the list baby girl. Check the list for Mr. Mays. Harling. The Stones continue to wail as Harling strolls on, adjusting the duffel bag he has slung over his shoulder.
NURSE: HARLING immediately goes to WHIP and supports him.
WHIP: It's okay, Harling.
HARLING MAYS: That's right honey, I'm on the list. Harling Mays. Some say they Harling knew me. HARLING boxes her out. She steps away.
HARLING MAYS: Classic hero worship, you're a rock star man. You gotta see the video I've got I'm making a doc about you, well us, y'know? HARLING pulls an iPad out of his knapsack and flips it open. He lets a collection of videos run.
WHIP: The meds they're giving me are fucking me up I'm all shaky and dried out. I can't sleep good. HARLING immediately picks up the small paper cup that holds WHIP's pain meds. He fishes out the two pills and stares at them. HARLING shakes his head.
HARLING MAYS: Aprazolam? That's generic Xanax and this Hydrocodone is generic Vicodin. It's shit, prolly HARLING casually tosses the pills down his gullet and expertly swallows them without water. He grabs WHIP's medical chart and scours it as he prattles on.
WHIP: Listen Harling, leave it alone.
HARLING MAYS: I decided to come by instead. And yes I got your fucking message and yes I brought you smokes. HARLING hands WHIP a pack of smokes from his pocket. He also pulls out a carton of smokes from his backpack.
WHIP: WHIP motions with his hands to "calm down."
HARLING MAYS: Sorry Whip. It's just.this is big time, man. You're a hero in a time when we really need heroes.
WHIP: Shut the fuck up, Harling.Six people died.
HARLING MAYS: 96 people lived! When are you gonna take yes for an answer? Pick up the phone, man. Fuck. HARLING pulls something from his vest pocket and puts it in WHIP'S hand. WHIP looks at it and back at HARLING.
WHIP: Harling, take the vodka with you. HARLING freezes his frenzied energy with this odd command.
HARLING MAYS: What?! Take the vodka? Dude, are you insane? I'm gonna just tuck it in the bottom of your-
WHIP: Take the fucking vodka! HARLING hears him this time and raises his hand and nods, putting the VODKA back in his own duffel. HARLING tosses a tee shirt, sweat pants and flip-flops on the bed, then.
HARLING MAYS: Okay man. Check it out. HARLING holds up a silk Japanese Happi Coat, with elaborate stitching depicting colorful birds flying around Mt. Fuji.
WHIP: Look, I'm tired man.
HARLING MAYS: I'm out. You rest up.
WHIP: You gotta come and get me, WHIP pulls his keys from the bag that CHARLIE gave him.
HARLING MAYS: The veal?
WHIP: Yeah, the veal that's in my Done and done. What time you need me here?
HARLING MAYS: Done and done. What time you need me here?
WHIP: Tomorrow. I'll call you.
HARLING MAYS: Send the mayday and you're outta here in 7 minutes.
WHIP: Thank you. WHIP leans his cane against the wall and carefully pulls a pack of smokes from his pocket.
NICOLE: Were you on the plane? WHIP studies her, she's beautiful in an exhausted way.
WHIP: Yeah, I was. Were you? Nicole shakes her head.
NICOLE: Where were you sitting?
WHIP: Up near the front. Again it falls silent as we let them smoke and think in the sanctity of the fire stairs. A VOICE breaks their silence.
NICOLE: He was. WHIP looks at the ground as the GAUNT YOUNG MAN studies him.
WHIP: Yeah, I'm lucky. Goin' home GAUNT YOUNG MAN Home. Home for me is the basement, they keep cancer treatment in the basement. I'm livin' here.
WHIP: You're living here?
WHIP: What kind of cancer?
WHIP: God chose you? You believe in God?
NICOLE: GAUNT YOUNG MAN What do you do in the world Nicole? She laughs, what a question.
NICOLE: Not much. I was a photographer and then I was a masseuse and I wash hair at a salon sometimes.
WHIP: I don't know her.
WHIP: Here's a pack.
NICOLE: Chemo brain. Chemo makes you pretty foggy.
WHIP: They call it chemo brain, my mom used to slur her words and get all Your mom had cancer.
NICOLE: They call it chemo brain, my mom used to slur her words and get all Your mom had cancer.
WHIP: Your mom had cancer.
NICOLE: Breast cancer, she was only 54. It's quiet.
WHIP: But why'd that guy ask you if you were gonna die?
NICOLE: I dunno. I flat-lined twice in the ambulance. Heroin addicts who use needles tend to die. Especially women for some reason.
WHIP: Is that right?
NICOLE: I have a pamphlet to prove it. A girl from AA just came to see me
WHIP: Well, where should we live? If we're gonna save the world, where should we do that? NICOLE laughs.
NICOLE: You don't want me. WHIP laughs.
WHIP: You don't want me either. NICOLE's laugh tapers off as she senses his honesty.
NICOLE: Why you wanna come visit? It's ( silence between them ) I live in Bankhead, it's south Atlanta, near the bus station.
WHIP: The luxurious bus station?
NICOLE: I'll come visit you.
WHIP: I'll come visit you.
NICOLE: You're sweet.
WHIP: I will. What's your address? She measures him.
NICOLE: I live at the Georgian Gardens on Taylor street.
WHIP: Georgian Gardens?
NICOLE: How long are you staying here?
WHIP: How long are you staying here?
NICOLE: Trying to stay as long as I can but I don't have insurance to cover rehab. I'll prolly be out Oh. Okay. And you're a masseuse?
WHIP: Oh. Okay. And you're a masseuse?
NICOLE: What kind of masseuse?
WHIP: What kind of masseuse?
NICOLE: I've been every kind of masseuse there is. There is strong tension between them. An orderly busts through the down the stairs. This breaks their stare.
WHIP: Good luck Nicole.
NICOLE: You too. WHIP leaves NICOLE where he found her.
WHIP: Thanks Mike. The ORDERLY tries to hand WHIP a medical file. HARLING snatches it.
HARLING MAYS: Yeah, thanks Mike. ( Harling tips him ) Here's 20 American.
ORDERLY MIKE: Thanks. Good luck, sir. HARLING hugs WHIP who hangs on tight. The ORDERLY spins the chair around and heads back inside. HARLING uses his key fob to remotely pop the trunk and stow Whip's duffel.
HARLING MAYS: This is how they get the Stones out of Madison Square Garden, man. 4 smoked black limos fly outta the VIP driveway and the fans jump on the limos.mayhem. Those limos? Empty. Meanwhile, Mick and the boys go out the service exit into delivery vans casual, rock star type shit. HARLING helps him into the front seat and they pull away. The Stones, "Gimme Shelter" starts to play. 53 As they drive off, we see media mayhem collected in front of 53 the hospital. Trucks with towers, cameramen, stringers and newscasters add to catering trucks and coffee stands as the vultures wait for the carrion of sound bytes and footage of INT. HARLING'S CADDY DAY Whip watches through the rear window the "Media Circus" disappears as the Caddy rounds a corner. The back seat is piled with Whip's clothes, most of them still on hangers. HARLING lights a cigarette and hands one to WHIP who takes I couldn't find any suitcases so I just put your shit in grocery bags. HARLING pulls a cold Becks from a cooler on the floor of the back seat and uses a bottle opener that's been screwed to the dash of his car next to the radio to open the beer. He offers the beer to WHIP who waves it off. HARLING gladly keeps it for himself. "Gimme Shelter" continues to play.

WHIP: No. I'm gonna go to the farm.
HARLING MAYS: The fucking farm?
WHIP: My dad's place. I can't stay at my I thought you sold that fucking Not yet.
HARLING MAYS: I thought you sold that fucking Not yet.
WHIP: Not yet.
HARLING MAYS: I'm not sure I wanna stay at the You're not. Just take me to the airport to get my car. Whip finishes opening the freezer bag it's full of cash. HARLING starts to laugh.
WHIP: You're not. Just take me to the airport to get my car. Whip finishes opening the freezer bag it's full of cash. HARLING starts to laugh.
HARLING MAYS: 58 Veal? Really? Don't you know the 58
CELL PHONE: You have 127 messages.
PHONE RINGS: WHIP is startled by the phone that never rings. He snaps off the TV using the remote. WHIP is in no hurry to answer the phone as the old time ring continues. WHIP goes to the desk where the phone rests and he watches the old answering machine click on. We hear.
VOICE MAIL: .I think that was the beep. Hey Cowboy, it's Charlie again. WHIP reaches for the phone but decides to just listen to
CHARLIE: ( speaking to voicemail ) I'm back in town and I stopped by the hospital tonight but they said you went home.so I guess you're feelin' pretty good, but um we went out to your condo and the manager said you had not returned.
VOICE MAIL: So.you may be with relatives, which I understand. I was really hoping to see you for breakfast. I'm at the St. Regis downtown.
CHARLIE: Whip, hey buddy. Glad you got my message. Grab a seat. WHIP studies HUGH as he pulls out his chair.
HUGH: Nice to meet you Captain Whitaker. WHIP and HUGH remain standing, both feeling a little "alpha."
CHARLIE: Siddown. Coffee? ( Whip nods, sits ) Miss, can we get some fresh coffee? She smiles and nods. She's off to get the coffee.
WHIP: God landed the plane? WHIP just stares at the two men who have large buffet plates surrounding them.
CHARLIE: I too believe that God landed that plane. The same way I believe that God should hit the buffet, the turkey sausage is excellent.
WHIP: I'm good with coffee.
CHARLIE: Len Caldwell was really trying to get here this morning. ( Whip seems lost ) Len is the president of the pilots' union and he wanted to be here with us and meet with you but they wanted him at the crash site. So.. WHIP is quiet, anxious to hear the purpose of the meeting.
WHIP: They find the flight data Yes they found them, perfectly Great. That solves everything. The recorders will tell the story. Why do we need a lawyer from Hugh's an attorney who specializes in criminal negligence-
CHARLIE: Yes they found them, perfectly Great. That solves everything. The recorders will tell the story. Why do we need a lawyer from Hugh's an attorney who specializes in criminal negligence-
WHIP: Great. That solves everything. The recorders will tell the story. Why do we need a lawyer from Hugh's an attorney who specializes in criminal negligence-
CHARLIE: Hugh's an attorney who specializes in criminal negligence-
WHIP: Criminal negligence? The WAITRESS returns with the coffee. It's quiet as they wait for her to finish. She does.
HUGH: Death demands responsibility. Six dead on that plane, someone has to The plane fell apart at 30 thousand The airline will try to prove equipment failure. Which would make the manufacturer responsible. The manufacturer of the plane will try to prove poor maintenance of the equipment by the airline.
WHIP: The plane fell apart at 30 thousand The airline will try to prove equipment failure. Which would make the manufacturer responsible. The manufacturer of the plane will try to prove poor maintenance of the equipment by the airline.
CHARLIE: The airline will try to prove equipment failure. Which would make the manufacturer responsible. The manufacturer of the plane will try to prove poor maintenance of the equipment by the airline.
HUGH: Or pilot error.
WHIP: I had to fly that plane inverted, that means upside down, Hugh. Do you get the picture? 100 passengers hanging upside down, 500 feet off the ground. Do you have any idea what that sounds like?
HUGH: I do. I heard the black box last Are you a pilot?
WHIP: Are you a pilot?
HUGH LANG: No I'm not.
WHIP: Then you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
CHARLIE: Hugh's on our team and it's the NTSB's ball game. They run the investigation and they will ultimately rule on the cause.
HUGH: They interview the entire flight crew and the passengers. They hold
WHIP: Charlie, what do I need to know? I'm already tired of this guy.
HUGH: The NTSB `go team' collects blood, skin and hair from the flight crew for a toxicology report. WHIP studies the two men, trying to read their poker hands.
WHIP: When did they do that?
HUGH: In the hospital. It's the first thing they do. Do you remember having your blood drawn on the night of the crash? WHIP looks at CHARLIE and then to HUGH.
WHIP: Do they have the results of these blood tests?
HUGH: Yeah, they do. The WAITRESS checks in.
WAITRESS: Anything else for you gentlemen?
WHIP: Did I just see warm cinnamon rolls come out?
WAITRESS: Yes sir.
WHIP: Bring me one wouldya? Actually bring me two, okay sweetie?
WAITRESS: Comin' up. An awkward silence as they wait for her to clear out.
HUGH: An initial report shows alcohol in your bloodstream at a level of .24. In the U.S.
WHIP: What does that mean? I had a beer the night before I flew. And what.That made the tail of the plane explode?
CHARLIE: Separate issues Whip-
WHIP: I need a lawyer.
CHARLIE: Hugh is your lawyer.
WHIP: I need a bigger lawyer. A lawyer who understands that I flew a broken plane and without me at that stick there'd be 102 funerals, not
HUGH: We're talking about prison not funerals. Somebody has-
WHIP: To write checks, well it's not me I promise you that. And as long as they're writing checks, write me one because someone put me in a broken plane. I'd love a check.
CHARLIE: EASY WHIP-
HUGH: This tox report states that you were drunk and high on cocaine, felonies punishable by 24 years in jail. And if your intoxication is proven to have caused the death of the 4 passengers you'll get 4 counts of manslaughter. That could be life in prison.
CHARLIE: He'll get it done, Whip. It's what his entire life is about. Trust me, trust him. ( Whip stares at Hugh ) Don't worry Whip, you're gonna walk away the hero you deserve to be.
WHIP: I'm not worried, Charlie. I promise you that. No one could have landed that plane like I did, no one. 68 The WAITRESS returns with a coffee pot. WHIP leaves. 68
PIERS MORGAN: Captain Tilmon, we wanna play a portion of the black box that all of the news outlets have grabbed hold of.
WHIP: ( ON TELEVISION )
BARTENDER: What'll you have?
WHIP: Can I get an orange juice? The BARTENDER leaves to grab the orange juice.
BARTENDER: That's it?
WHIP: And a double shot of Stoli. The BARTENDER nods and turns in acknowledgement of the order.
PIERS MORGAN: ( ON TELEVISION )
JIM TILMON: ( ON TELEVISION )
PASSENGER 1: We were in a nose dive and people were screaming and yelling and then the plane turned upside down and we had to hold on to our seat belts to keep from falling out of our chairs I saw one kid fall to the floor and this flight attendant picked him up and handed him to his dad.I didn't see her again.
PASSENGER 2: We turned like a corkscrew and all I could think was, "this is really happening, I'm going to die" and then all of a sudden the plane was upside down but steady and the pilot must have known how to fly it that way. He flipped it back over and landed it hard.
NEIGHBOR: I thought it was thunder at first. But it shook the ground hard. Thunder don't do like that. I ran outside and I could hear people yelling and I could see a small fire at first. I just took the dogs and headed down there. Then I saw the plane crumpled on the ground. I never seen nothing like that in my life.
WHIP: ( TO HIMSELF )
MONEY!: He heads off.
WHIP: The fuck are you doin'!? FRAN stumbles and falls as the bat goes flying to the ground and rolls away. WHIP licks the foaming top of his excited ( gives Whip a puzzled
FRAN: ( gives Whip a puzzled
LOOK ): Hey, don't I know you? Whip jabs him again with his cane.
WHIP: Keep your fucking hands off her! NICOLE who is crying, now laughs in relief. She can't believe it. "America's Hero" has just come to her rescue. WHIP moves to comfort her..
NICOLE: ( nods again, recovering ) Just this stuff. She points to a camera tripod and a box of broken portfolios with photos dripping out.
WHIP: Okay, start taking that stuff down. FRAN has gotten up and stands a safe distance from WHIP.
FRAN: She owes me 1100 bucks! Plus You wanna spend a thousand bucks suing her and get jack shit? Or do you want to make a cash deal with Give me 700 in cash.
WHIP: You wanna spend a thousand bucks suing her and get jack shit? Or do you want to make a cash deal with Give me 700 in cash.
FRAN: Give me 700 in cash.
WHIP: You're a creep.with your baseball bat bullshit. Whip flings his beer at Fran's head, then pulls out his ( sorts through his cash ) I'll give you 400 in cash. Whip throws the money on the floor. FRAN sorts the options.none.he tentatively bends down and picks up the cash. Keeping a wary eye on Whip.
NICOLE: Ah.my car doesn't run. It won't start. I'm taking this with me.
WHIP: Your car doesn't run? What were you gonna do?
NICOLE: I don't.I.I was. I don't know what I was gonna do. Fran smirks. Whip drills Fran with his eyes.
WHIP: ( with deliberate malice ) Then put the fucking box in my car. FRAN's smirk fades. He relents and picks up the box as WHIP grabs the lighter shoulder bag and they head downstairs.
NICOLE: What's your name? WHIP looks to her, she to him. They begin to laugh at the absurdity. When it subsides.
WHIP: NICOLE nods. A long moment quietly passes.
NICOLE: Thank you, Captain Whip.
WHIP: You okay?
NICOLE: I was gonna lay down, get some WHIP takes another sip before returning to massaging his leg.
WHIP: WHIP takes another sip before returning to massaging his leg.
NICOLE: Is it really okay that I stay here?
WHIP: Yea. I want you to stay. NICOLE walks over to WHIP and kneels down and gently takes over massaging his leg. WHIP exhales.
NICOLE: It's throbbing because the blood is having a hard time getting back to your heart. 78 NICOLE continues to soothe his aching leg. After a moment, 78 NICOLE stands and takes the drink out of WHIP's hand and sets it down. She now bends down and kisses him softly. She now stands and takes his hand, leading him in to the bedroom.
HUGH: Do you wanna shoot me or can I come C'mon in. I'll shoot you inside. HUGH walks closer to the porch. WHIP questions him.
WHIP: C'mon in. I'll shoot you inside. HUGH walks closer to the porch. WHIP questions him.
HUGH: Your voice mail is full and you never answer your cell phone. I called your cell 10 times.
WHIP: I turned it off. HUGH nods as the explanation lands.
HUGH: I thought we'd take a ride. WHIP measures HUGH's intention.
WHIP: Okay, gimme a minute. Wait here. 82 HUGH nods and recedes from the door as WHIP goes to get 82 EXT. CRASH SITE OBSERVATION SCAFFOLDING DAY WHIP joins HUGH on a rectangular platform on top of a two- story scaffolding frame. The platform provides a perfect view of flight 227's final resting area. We see the awesome devastation that 50 tons of metal flying at 140 miles an hour can do to a hillside.
HUGH: You can see the initial impact sheared the right wing clean off. If only the left wing had come off at impact, I think everyone would have walked off that plane.
WHIP: The left wing partially pulled away-
HUGH: It snapped but stayed connected to the airframe. So it whipped back towards the plane, hit the fuselage in front of the tail. If you were sitting in the last 6 or 7 rows on the left side, it was like being hit by a train.
WHIP: I drank a lot the night before that flight. I drank that morning too and I used coke to straighten up.
HUGH: I know, it's in the toxicology But that's not the reason this I know. WHIP looks at HUGH expecting him to finish his thought. HUGH holds his look for a beat before changing thoughts.
WHIP: But that's not the reason this I know. WHIP looks at HUGH expecting him to finish his thought. HUGH holds his look for a beat before changing thoughts.
HUGH: I know. WHIP looks at HUGH expecting him to finish his thought. HUGH holds his look for a beat before changing thoughts.
MINISTER: "He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away." Revelation 21:4 There are at least 50 people sitting in white folding chairs at the foot of the hill. A small brook babbles behind them. WHIP continues to take in the bizarre scene.
HUGH: They helped pull survivors out of the wreckage. Now they come out here every day and have a mass 30 minutes prior to the crash. And then they sit in silent prayer for 10 minutes at 9:42.which is when you went down. WHIP is overwhelmed by the magnitude of the crash field and the WORSHIPPERS. WHIP looks back at the crash site to see.
NTSB INVESTIGATORS: Inside the crash site, a small group of INVESTIGATORS with NTSB jackets following the lead of a CONFIDENT WOMAN. HUGH answers the question in WHIP's mind.
WHIP: Why'd you bring me here?
HUGH: I needed you to see this.
WHIP: You trying to scare me?
HUGH: I need to know that you can handle all this.
WHIP: Who's God would do this? It's quiet before HUGH makes his case.
HUGH: So here's the deal. Avington Carr, the owner of the airline, is on our side.and he's got big friends in Washington. He wants to sit down with us. 10 O'clock tomorrow WHIP's had enough. He starts to walk away. HUGH stops him.
WHIP: I'll stop. I can stop. ( Hugh stays quiet ) I told you I can stop. I won't 10 O'clock tomorrow morning with Mr. Carr, the owner of the airline.
HUGH: 10 O'clock tomorrow morning with Mr. Carr, the owner of the airline.
MR. CARR: I never wanted that fuckin' airline. Neither did my brother.
HUGH LANG: I like baseball. Everyone looks to HUGH as it gets oddly silent. We get our first look at LEN CALDWELL, the president of the pilots' union. LEN tries to wrest some control and exude some Everyone in Georgia likes baseball.
LEN CALDWELL: Everyone in Georgia likes baseball.
MR. CARR: Yeah.so what's the deal Lenny? Is your union gonna survive this one? More importantly? How big a check you think I'm gonna have to There were 6 fatalities on the
LEN CALDWELL: There were 6 fatalities on the
HUGH LANG: The 2 crew members don't get settlements like the passengers. That's a workman's comp claim, part of the union contract they do a dangerous job and they know it.
MR. CARR: You're the lawyer for the pilots' No, this is Hugh Lang, the attorney we brought in to handle the criminal side of Captain Whitaker's MR. CARR Yes, and what is Mr. Whitaker's situation? NTSB is up my ass with a flashlight. We had to give them access to everything.
LEN CALDWELL: No, this is Hugh Lang, the attorney we brought in to handle the criminal side of Captain Whitaker's MR. CARR Yes, and what is Mr. Whitaker's situation? NTSB is up my ass with a flashlight. We had to give them access to everything.
MR. CARR: Yes, and what is Mr. Whitaker's situation? NTSB is up my ass with a flashlight. We had to give them access to everything.
CHARLIE: I flew with him. He's a great MR. CARR Is he a drunk?
MR. CARR: Is he a drunk?
CHARLIE: He's a heavy drinker. Should I bring him in? Everyone steals glances at WHIP as CARR continues to MR. CARR In a minute. Alright, so let's get down to it, Lenny. What does the union plan to do about this blood test that says Whitaker was high on booze and coke? This guy's a real I'm gonna kill the toxicology ( feels eyes of disbelief ) It was done incompetently. The last time the toxicology equipment they used was calibrated was in June of 2009, which is 18 months past code. Their log that should clearly state who labeled the blood vials and when, is very incomplete. And they aren't sure who stored them. They used a preservative in the vials that has in some cases caused blood to ferment and register higher in an alcohol test. That's what I've done so far. I can handle this.

MR. CARR: I like this guy Lenny. He makes me wanna go out and sniff a few lines and fly a jet.
LEN CALDWELL: Mr. Carr, we're gonna fight to push all the fault on Jackson Ridgefield, the manufacturer.
MR. CARR: Oh and you think they're gonna just open their check book and buy us all lunch? Good fucking luck. What's my exposure Jim?
MR. CARR: Fuck the airline. The insurance companies can have the goddamm airline. I just don't want them to come sniffing in my other pockets.
LEN CALDWELL: Speaking for the pilots' union? We don't want your airline to go away. We enjoy your contract with us and we will protect Captain Whitaker and in turn protect your airline.
MR. CARR: That's sweet Mr. Caldwell, but if the NTSB leaks that toxicology report showing my pilot was flying that plane drunk? We're all So far we've been lucky.
CHARLIE: So far we've been lucky.
MR. CARR: Lucky?! Are you that goddammed dumb?! You think they're waiting for a light news day to splash the headline, "Drunk, coke-addled pilot crashes a plane?!" EVERYONE goes quiet as CARR's anger commands silence.
HUGH LANG: Trust me, I'm gonna kill the toxicology report. That's my job. CARR looks to his lawyer who nods.
CARR'S ATTORNEY: I wish you luck, but we're still sorting out the best way to go forward legally. We might split from you and go it alone. CARR stands to signal the end of the meeting. HUGH stands to stop him.
HUGH LANG: To go it alone? Without us? That would be what the French call "a big fucking mistake."
MR. CARR: Does Whitaker know he's going to I haven't had a client go to jail MR. CARR He's going to jail. He belongs in jail. You bet your ass he's going to jail, the question is.is he gonna die in jail?
HUGH LANG: I haven't had a client go to jail MR. CARR He's going to jail. He belongs in jail. You bet your ass he's going to jail, the question is.is he gonna die in jail?
MR. CARR: He's going to jail. He belongs in jail. You bet your ass he's going to jail, the question is.is he gonna die in jail?
HUGH LANG: You're wrong, Mr. Carr.
CARR'S ATTORNEY: Last time I checked, 6 counts of manslaughter is life in prison.
MR. CARR: Life in prison, what we in Georgia call "all day long." It goes quiet as everyone reflects on that reality.
MR. CARR: They tell me you're some kind of 86 CARR nods, sizing WHIP up. WHIP returns the nod as HUGH 86 quickly puts a hand on WHIP's back and leads him away like a heavyweight being returned to his corner after pre-fight THE TELEVISION IN WHIP'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT We are now in WHIP's living room watching HOME MOVIES.
WHIP'S VOICE: Get up! What? You can't get up?! ( Whip is laughing. ) C'mon, Knuckles Whitaker drags himself up and goes long.go. We watch an 8 year-old WILL WHITAKER run long as the ball flies to him. He catches it and on-screen WHIP hollers.
NICOLE: Hey. Sorry I'm a little late, but we went for coffee after the ( Whip doesn't look ) NICOLE goes close to see WHIP look at her with a non-focused stare. She sees the table and reads the situation. NICOLE watches as WHIP stands up. In his oblivion he tries to focus.
WHIP: Don't, don't, don't! I'll get him. Knuckles, junior. See him. Yeah. I'm not calling again. Fuck him. He didn't call. Not back. Not calling back. NICOLE backs away as she watches the blacked-out ballet play itself out in slow, tragic fashion. WHIP motions to his lips as if he is smoking. He freezes and then steps forward and trips in to the coffee table. Whip falls to the ground. NICOLE checks WHIP's face to see his eyes partially opened but passed out. NICOLE goes to the bedroom and returns with a blanket that she covers WHIP with. She also places a pillow under his head making sure that his head is titled to the side so he doesn't choke. NICOLE looks around the room. She begins to collect the bottles and straighten up.
WHIP: WHIP coughs and rubs his eyes.
NICOLE: Are you okay? You were in bad shape when I got home.
WHIP: Tired. Guess I drank a bit.
NICOLE: A bit?
WHIP: You wanna count the fuckin' beers? They're still in the garbage. Vodka too, is that okay with you?
NICOLE: It's more than okay, Whip.
WHIP: It's quiet as they let the awkward exchange pass.
NICOLE: I've been watching the sky change as the sun rises. Beautiful. ( holds up the camera ) Perfect light, I went out and took some great shots. WHIP reaches for the camera. She hands it to him.
WHIP: Lemme see that camera.
NICOLE: My mom got it for me. Towards the end, when she knew she wasn't gonna recover. She maxed out her credit card to buy me that camera and a lighting kit. NICOLE takes a moment to tamp down some emotions.
WHIP: It was my grandfather's farm, my dad grew up here. He was a pilot in World War II, flew with the 332nd. See the landing strip out there? He built that. He ran a crop duster outta here until the EPA put an end to that. ( she nods, listening ) He traded the crop duster for a used Cessna. He flew that damn thing all over. It's still in the barn. I was gonna sell this place after my dad died. Then I got And your mom?
NICOLE: And your mom?
WHIP: Dead.she's dead. Your dad still I'm pretty sure my father lives in You got no relationship with him.
NICOLE: I'm pretty sure my father lives in You got no relationship with him.
WHIP: You got no relationship with him.
NICOLE: He drank. It was my mom that raised me. She was incredible. NICOLE lights a cigarette as the memories are tough.
BOY: I'm Trevor. You saved my mom. WHIP looks up to see MARGARET THOMASON walking towards him. She has her left arm in a sling underneath her jacket. We can see a bandage along her hairline. WHIP smiles, obviously uncomfortable. MARGARET hugs him.
MARGARET: It's great to see you, Whip.
WHIP: You too Margaret. Broken collar Yeah, and some stitches but I'm fine. I really am. ( she goes quiet ) It was a nice service. I mean, look at all these people that wanted to say goodbye. She looked beautiful in there. ( Whip is blank ) Didn't you think so, Whip? Like she was gonna wake up and smile.
MARGARET: Yeah, and some stitches but I'm fine. I really am. ( she goes quiet ) It was a nice service. I mean, look at all these people that wanted to say goodbye. She looked beautiful in there. ( Whip is blank ) Didn't you think so, Whip? Like she was gonna wake up and smile.
WHIP: I didn't go in. I couldn't. MARGARET is sensing WHIP's struggle.
MARGARET: Trevor, find Dad. He's by Mr. Benton, there.
WHIP: No. I can't, really. I will, but just not now. It's quiet. MARGARET smiles and leans in and kisses WHIP on the cheek.
MARGARET: Take care Whip, okay? She starts to leave.WHIP stops her with.
WHIP: Yeah.y'know.I'm in the middle of this investigation. The NTSB is investigating the crash-
MARGARET: I know. I'm going in to see them next week.
WHIP: I'm nervous because I was out the night before the crash at dinner-
MARGARET: With Trina.
WHIP: Yeah and I had two glasses of wine. And they might ask you about my condition that morning and if you thought I had anything to drink. MARGARET appears speechless.
MARGARET: I've known you 11 years and you're gonna stand here and tell me you and Trina went to dinner and you drank two glasses of wine? Sounds like a nice restaurant Whip, which one was it?
WHIP: You have to tell them it was an ordinary day. I mean it was an ordinary day. You know I was in shape to fly. You have a problem with saying that?
MARGARET: It's a lie. Whip, it's a lie. Trina told me you two hadn't been to sleep.
WHIP: My lack of sleep made the plane fall apart, huh Margaret? I'm just trying to get it straight. You think that another pilot would have been able to land that plane and save more lives?
MARGARET: I didn't say that Whip. I can't imagine another pilot doing-
WHIP: Well can you imagine Trevor at this same church looking at you in that box in there? Or my son having to come and see me in prison? MARGARET fights tears as WHIP has struck a blow.
MARGARET: Please Whip, enough. Don't you think we've all had enough. ( Whip is quiet ) What do you want me to say?
WHIP: It was an ordinary day. The storm right after we took off was very severe, but as far as the flight crew was concerned it was a perfectly ordinary day. The tears flow now as MARGARET can't hold them in. WHIP realizes he's gone too far. Not knowing what to do, WHIP walks away.
NICOLE: Are you okay? How was it?
WHIP: It was okay, okay. How're you A beat.
NICOLE: Well, I got through my first day. They haven't fired me.
WHIP: That's good. Cause for a They needed someone to work the night shift. They asked me and it's time and a half so.
NICOLE: They needed someone to work the night shift. They asked me and it's time and a half so.
WINGS ): You're dad flew a P-51, right?
WHIP: ( stares at the lighter ) He did. So should we get some I promised Sheila I would be at the meeting tonight. She's the one that's been helping me, my sponsor. Can we do it tomorrow night? And Please, Whip don't make me choose between dinner with you and the WHIP nods, playing with the lighter.
NICOLE: I promised Sheila I would be at the meeting tonight. She's the one that's been helping me, my sponsor. Can we do it tomorrow night? And Please, Whip don't make me choose between dinner with you and the WHIP nods, playing with the lighter.
WHIP: No, it's okay. You should go.
NICOLE: Why don't you come with me? We'll eat after. It's an open meeting.
WHIP: Open meeting?
NICOLE: That means anybody can come. Even me? She is bubbling with happy spirit; she's hot. She's hard to deny as WHIP can't help but smile at her.
WHIP: Even me? She is bubbling with happy spirit; she's hot. She's hard to deny as WHIP can't help but smile at her.
THE ASSEMBLY: ( IN UNISON )
WHIP: I gotta go. Okay?
NICOLE: Yeah, Sheila. She can take me back to work.
SHEILA: ( extends her hand ) I'm Sheila. WHIP shakes her hand before quickly escaping as if from a fire. We stay close on WHIP's face as he walks out. BARRY continues his pitch.
KEN EVANS: ( ON TELEVISION )
PIERS MORGAN: ( on a split screen ) So, safe to say that he remains a Sir, those are your words not mine. WHIP exits as fast as he arrived. He's gone. PIERS MORGAN continues from the TV.
KEN EVANS: ( ON TELEVISION )
PIERS MORGAN: ( ON TELEVISION )
KEN EVANS: ( ON TELEVISION )
PIERS MORGAN: ( ON TELEVISION )
KEN EVANS: ( ON TELEVISION )
WHIP: How're you feeling, Ken? EVANS stares at WHIP with a blank look.
EVANS: Happy to be alive.
VICKI EVANS: Blessed to be alive.
WHIP: I'm Captain Whitaker, I was flying-
VICKI EVANS: I know who you are. WHIP senses an unwelcome undercurrent. He locks eyes with EVANS trying to read him. Silence before EVANS speaks to the
EVANS: Ma'am can you give us some privacy? Thank you.
WHIP: Listen, how long have you been.
EVANS: Outta the coma? Two days.
WHIP: I didn't mean to disrupt your whole day. I know they been swamping you with interviews. You were great on
EVANS: Both my legs were crushed and my pelvis snapped. I'll probably never walk again, least not without a walker or braces. I'll certainly never fly again.
WHIP: I'm sorry Ken.
EVANS: That plane was doomed the second you sat in the chair. You reeked like gin or somethin'. I called Vicki from the plane before we took off. That's when the rain kicked VICKI nods, holding her cross with the chain across her lips.
WHIP: I don't know how much you remember, but the plane started to fall I remember everything until we crashed. I know what went on.
EVANS: I remember everything until we crashed. I know what went on.
WHIP: What are we talking about?
EVANS: I don't know Captain Whitaker, what are we talking about?
WHIP: I just wanted to get a sense from you what you thought caused the Was it the fact that you got on the plane drunk from the night before? WHIP goes white and drops his head.
EVANS: Was it the fact that you got on the plane drunk from the night before? WHIP goes white and drops his head.
WHIP: You think you'd be alive without me on that plane?
EVANS: No, we'd all be dead. But are you gonna argue that your physical state was tip top?
WHIP: I'm not gonna argue anything with WHIP gets up.
EVANS: Sit, please sit.
VICKI EVANS: Praise Jesus.
EVANS: And he has a higher plan for you sir. This event although tragic in its loss of life is also a celebration of life. EVANS begins to mist up with sincere inspiration.
VICKI EVANS: Praise Jesus.
EVANS: Captain, will you pray with me? WHIP stares into EVANS' eyes and sees a believer's conviction. EVANS reaches out his hand to WHIP. WHIP slowly moves out of his chair and kneels at the side of EVANS' bed. WHIP takes EVANS' hand and bows his head as he reaches for VICKI's at the same time. It's quiet before.
VICKI EVANS: Praise Jesus. It is quiet for an extended beat. Finally.
WHIP: Praise Jesus. 97 WHIP looks at EVANS and his WIFE whose heads are bowed with 97 EXT. WHITAKER FARM DRIVEWAY NIGHT A small pickup truck rambles to a stop in the driveway. We hear music and laughter as NICOLE gets out.
NICOLE: Thanks for the ride guys. I'll see you tomorrow.
COWORKER: Keep it up Nicole, you could be employee of the year. They all laugh; Nicole waves as they drive off. She walks towards the house which is dark. She hears music and looks towards the barn to see bright light escaping through the sagging doors and split wood walls.
WHIP: Looks great right?
NICOLE: It's kind of.beautiful. WHIP wipes at his nose.
WHIP: It's a Cessna 172, it was my dad's. He kept it perfect. NICOLE takes in this cool trinket of aviation history.
NICOLE: Does it work.
WHIP: Yeah, he flew this plane a few months before he died. I learned to fly in this plane. You can land it anywhere. WHIP laughs, remembering.
NICOLE: Jamaica? In this?
WHIP: We set off for an overnight fishing trip two hours south of here. We ended up in Bethel, Jamaica.
NICOLE: You're insane.
WHIP: It was like a picture on a post card. The white sand and sky blue water. Most beautiful place I've ever been.
NICOLE: Was the water warm?
WHIP: Yeah, really warm.
NICOLE: That's my kind of place.
WHIP: Let's go.
NICOLE: Sure, why not. NICOLE laughs thinking they're playing a game.
WHIP: Let's go tomorrow.
NICOLE: You're serious?
WHIP: We'll leave in the morning.we'll just go. Start over. NICOLE realizes he's serious as he opens another beer.
NICOLE: Whip, we can't.
WHIP: It's a beautiful beach, it's I'm worried about you.
NICOLE: I'm worried about you.
WHIP: ( laughs a bit lit ) I'm fine thanks.
NICOLE: No you're not, you're really not. You need help, Whip. I think you need rehab.
WHIP: You go to a couple of AA meetings and all of a sudden you think you're Jesus Christ? Worry about We're the same Whip, you and me, we're the same-
NICOLE: We're the same Whip, you and me, we're the same-
WHIP: WE'RE NOT- WE ARE-
NICOLE: WE ARE-
WHIP: I didn't suck dick to get high. And don't give me a whole.
NICOLE: Never Whip, I never in my life-
WHIP: Your mom died and dad drank and bullshit, bullshit, bullshit
NICOLE: Stop. Please stop.
WHIP: Is that why you shot dope?
NICOLE: That's not fair-
WHIP: Well there's a lot of people out there who lost their mom who've never had a drink in their life.
NICOLE: You're sick, Whip. NICOLE walks away, leaving WHIP with his plane and his dream of freedom. WHIP calls after her.
WHIP: I choose to drink.
NICOLE: Do you? You choose it? I don't see a lot of choice goin' on.
WHIP: I choose to drink! And I blame it on me. I'm happy to. I've got an ex-wife and a son I don't see. Why? Because I choose to drink!
WHIP: Alright look, I was loaded when I crashed that plane. With this investigation going on, I don't know what's gonna happen. Come to Jamaica with me.
NICOLE: Whip. I'm afraid I'll use again.
WHIP: Come with me. I need help, I do.
NICOLE: I'd love for you to get help, Whip.
WHIP: When we get to Jamaica we can go to the local hospital. I'll do it for you. Anything you want. NICOLE looks at the sincere love in his eyes.
NICOLE: I don't wanna use again. I can't. I won't make it back.
WHIP: I'll be sober. I won't force you to stay. I promise if you don't like it or if I don't clean up? You can leave. This is the most sincere plea she's ever heard.
CHARLIE: ( speaking to voice mail ) Hey Whip, if you're there pickup.I got some good news. WHIP snatches the phone of the hook.
WHIP: Yeah, I'm here. What's goin' on? 104 WHIP listens as CHARLIE talks. 104
CHARLIE: Here's our guy. C'mon. WHIP walks towards a ramp that leads up to the hole in the plane where the door used to be. CHARLIE stands at the top of the ramp. Suddenly HUGH steps out of the plane.
HUGH: Captain Whitaker, we've won. WHIP doesn't move as HUGH starts down the ramp.
CHARLIE: They've scheduled the hearing. It's in 10 days. CHARLIE and HUGH reach the bottom of the ramp.
HUGH: But these hearings can be tough. You just need to stay sharp and on course and answer the questions correctly. It's no longer a question of your condition but the condition of the plane. This picks directly at the scab of WHIP's guilt.
WHIP: Look, it's simple. I flew a broken You got it. That's right.
CHARLIE: You got it. That's right.
WHIP: And what about my toxicology ( trying to stay calm ) I killed it. They have no physical proof that you were intoxicated on that plane. And no eye witness claims. But there's a problem. This stops WHIP cold.
HUGH: ( trying to stay calm ) I killed it. They have no physical proof that you were intoxicated on that plane. And no eye witness claims. But there's a problem. This stops WHIP cold.
WHIP: Okay. I see.where this is going. That's funny that they found two Because I drank three. One's HUGH explodes in frustration.
HUGH: Because I drank three. One's HUGH explodes in frustration.
WHIP: Because I drank three. One's HUGH explodes in frustration.
HUGH LANG: When I met you I couldn't believe what a flip, drunk, arrogant scumbag you were.
WHIP: Fuck you too, Hugh.
HUGH LANG: But I did the research and heard the analysis from the experts. I'm in awe of what you did.
WHIP: Can I go now? HUGH gets big as he has to add the final piece of credence to the coronation.
HUGH LANG: THE NTSB AND THE FAA TOOK 10 EXPERIENCED PILOTS AND PLACED THEM IN SIMULATORS. THEY RECREATED ALL OF THE EVENTS THAT LED TO THIS PLANE FALLING OUT OF THE SKY! HUGH is so loud and emotional even WHIP lends focus.
WHIP: Yeah. So?
HUGH: You have no capacity to accept the responsibility for the miracle you performed and the lives you saved.
WHIP: Great. I'm going home. WHIP pulls out his cigarettes and frees a smoke from the Do you want to go to prison? I'm trying to save your life! CHARLIE steps between them as this exchange spirals.
HUGH LANG: Do you want to go to prison? I'm trying to save your life! CHARLIE steps between them as this exchange spirals.
WHIP: What fucking life?! Don't kill yourself on my account, Hugh. WHIP starts to walk away.
HUGH: Okay, I'm done here. I'm running out a faith that this guy's gonna make it, Charlie.
WHIP: ( turns on Hugh ) You wanna talk about me like I'm not here? Like I'm fucking dead?
HUGH: ( to Whip now ) This NTSB hearing is a Federal Agency Hearing. Do you understand that? It's in 10 days and if I show up with you like this?! WHIP turns and walks. HUGH wheels on CHARLIE and lights him Everything we've done? Everything I've done? Goes out the window. That's not on me. I did my job. It's your job, Charlie, to get him straight and get him to the church on time.
WHIP: Yeah Charlie just get him home. Sober him up long enough to save the union's contract and that fat fuck's airline. Fuck you. I shoulda died on that plane. 106 WHIP walks away from them away from the bright, clean, 106 shiny floor of the hangar and into the growing rain storm.
DEANA: What are you doing here?
WHIP: It's lovely to see you too Deana. May I come in?
WHIP: Thought I`d come see you and Will. ( calls out, loudly )
DEANA: You know that I prefer that you call us.
WHIP: Call you? Like anyone in this house has called me in the last three years to say anything other than "Where's the money?"
DEANA: Have you been drinking?
WHIP: Well that took.what? 17 seconds? ( fake checks his watch ) It took 17 seconds for you-
DEANA: I'm gonna ask you to step outside of the house, please.
WHIP: ( has continued to rant ) LADIES and GENTLEMEN it took
DEANA: I'm calling the police.
WHIP: You're asking me to leave the house I bought for you?! Very good.
WHIP: William Whitaker, junior. The man of the house. Nice of you to call me back.
WILL: I'm telling you to leave.
WHIP: You are? Are you the man of the You upset my mother. You gotta go.
WILL: You upset my mother. You gotta go.
WHIP: I'm your father, tough guy.
WILL: You're a drunk. Now get the fuck You don't know who the fuck I am!
WHIP: You don't know who the fuck I am!
WILL: ( pulling open the door ) I sure don't.
WHIP: What did you say?
WILL: I said, "I sure don't." Why don't you tell me? Who the fuck are you?! Who are you? Huh? WHO ARE
YOU?!: DEANA now steps between them and pushes WILL towards the stairs as she puts her hand on the doorknob.
WHIP: I'm outta here. I'm outta here. I know where I'm not wanted. WHIP turns quietly. He opens the door and walks outside to A GROWING GALLERY OF NEWS RATS START JOSTLING FOR PICS WHIP is completely caught off guard. They step right onto the tiny landing with him. Through the fracas we hear a variety of questions lobbed at
WHIP: Folks, please give us some room. ( gets down the stairs ) At the appropriate time I will tell my story. Now is a time for grieving and taking care of those injured. Thank you. I appreciate your interest in me but I ask that you leave my family in peace. The GALLERY quiets to listen and record his words. WHIP again is incredibly smooth and intuitive while drunk and under pressure. We can hear the squawking of POLICE SIRENS WHIP starts to head down the porch and the frenzy erupts The POLICE begin to disperse the NEWS RATS. WHIP pulls an officer aside.
WHIP: I'm Captain Whitaker, I was-
YOUNG COP: Yes sir, I know who you are.
WHIP: Can you get me to my car?
YOUNG COP: ( STUDIES HIM )
WHIP: Now is a time for grieving and taking care of those injured. Thank you. I appreciate your interest in me but I ask that you leave my family in peace. A REPORTER now wraps up the piece.
TELEVISION: A reasonable request from a quiet, heroic man who's been through so much. This is Tilda Banden reporting from Devonwood. Now a DESK ANCHOR changes stories.
DESK ANCHOR: In a related story, tonight at 10 Cale Rawson talks with aviation experts to see if the tragedy of flight 227 could have been avoided. We boom down to find WHIP who looks drained as he sits on CHARLIE's couch in the fastidiously neat office. WHIP holds an unlit smoke. The WOODEN POCKET DOORS SLIDE OPEN and CHARLIE's WIFE gestures towards WHIP. WHIP stands as CHARLIE enters.
WHIP: Hey, Charlie. Thank you. Amanda was so nice to let me in. It's just.I couldn't find a safe AMANDA slides the door shut as CHARLIE throws his bag and his coat down with gusto. He reaches up and pushes a button on the TV and it goes off.
CHARLIE: What the hell is wrong with you? I spoke to Hugh, he told me that you went to your ex-wife's house? Drunk as a skunk and the news crews showed up? ( Whip just stares ) And the police escorted you out?
WHIP: I think it's okay. I've been watching and I think it's okay.
CHARLIE: Hugh checked every media outlet that covered it and it looks like we're good. You come off fine.
WHIP: Okay. Good then. Listen Charlie, here's the deal-
CHARLIE: No Whip. No deals. Look at you. I have no idea what you're gonna do or say, ever. You're all over the place. I was the one guy in your court. I was your apologist, your defender. But not anymore.
WHIP: No. I can do this.
CHARLIE: You're about to be questioned by a Federal Agency about piloting an airliner drunk.an airliner that crashed. And you continue to drink and stumble around. What kind of crazy do you have to be to do that? I'm scared of you.
WHIP: Let's just stick to the plan.
CHARLIE: You can't stick to anything.
WHIP: This whole thing has just been so heavy, it's killing me. Tell Hugh, I can do it. Look, I really wanna fly again, get back to my life and be done with all this shit.
CHARLIE: This hearing is 10 days away. Hugh busted his ass to try to get you excused, but there's no way. You have to appear.
WHIP: Let me stay here. They have my houses all staked out now. Let me stay here until the hearing, Charlie. I won't leave the house. CHARLIE takes a long look at his old, troubled friend.
CHARLIE: You can't drink here, Whip. You can't drink in my house. Can you do that?
WHIP: I won't drink. 118 CHARLIE nods, hoping that WHIP can deliver on that promise 118
HUGH: You look great, Whip. I mean that.
WHIP: Thank you. I feel really good.
HUGH: I heard you haven't had a drink in 8 days.
WHIP: 9 days. ( checks his watch ) Two hours and 26 minutes.but who's counting? CHARLIE addresses the SECURITY GUARD.
CHARLIE: Officer Edmonds?
OFFICER EDMONDS: Yes sir.
CHARLIE: Whip, Officer Edmonds will be staying here tonight. Any problems he'll handle it. HUGH stands by the open door and gestures CHARLIE and WHIP INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL WHIP'S ROOM NIGHT HUGH walks in to the center of the room and turns to WHIP.
HUGH: Well, Whip we just wanted to make this as easy for you as possible. WHIP puts his wardrobe bag down on the bed.
CHARLIE: Just get a good night's rest. Relax, order up a steak, get a WHIP is checking his phone. HUGH gestures to CHARLIE for him to leave so they can be alone.
WHIP: Wait, Charlie, thanks for letting me stay with you. I needed it.
CHARLIE: You did great cowboy.
WHIP: You've got a beautiful family.
CHARLIE: I'm very blessed. CHARLIE leaves and HUGH joins WHIP at the window. HUGH hands WHIP a thick folder.
HUGH LANG: I made you a copy of my entire file on you and the investigation. I also tried to anticipate what you might be asked under oath and I wrote out some non-damaging responses. It's all in there; photos, testimony, interviews.I called Ellen Block let her know that you're here and all tucked in.
WHIP: So does she have the knife out for Remember she's limited in what she can ask you. You're not on trial but you are under oath. She's probably not happy that I killed the tox report, but you'll be fine. WHIP laughs a little.
HUGH LANG: Remember she's limited in what she can ask you. You're not on trial but you are under oath. She's probably not happy that I killed the tox report, but you'll be fine. WHIP laughs a little.
WHIP: Hello? Anyone? Whip enters.
WHIP'S POV: Among the glass and steel office buildings, Whip spots a church spire. A simple cross is perched on top. Whip looks at the church, deep in thought. Then suddenly. We HEAR A HUM. THE GENTLE HUM OF AN ELECTRIC MOTOR. WHIP turns from the window and scans the room. It's the MINI-BAR refrigerator HUMMING to life.
CHARLIE: Good morning, how's our man?
OFFICER EDMONDS: Not a peep. CHARLIE knocks on the door and checks his watch as he waits for WHIP to answer. CHARLIE cocks his head, knocks again.
CHARLIE: I think your pilot overslept.
HUGH: You didn't let any girls in there last night did you?
OFFICER EDMONDS: No sir, not a soul. No one came in or out. They all wait awkwardly as HUGH checks his watch and knocks on the door. More silence.
HUGH LANG: Did he disappear? CHARLIE tentatively walks around the empty room, the bathroom, the closet, until he finally sees the adjoining room door. He turns to HUGH with a surprised look.
CHARLIE: Whip? Hello? CHARLIE knocks on the slightly opened adjoining door. No response, so CHARLIE lightly tosses the door open.
HUGH: Where is he?
CHARLIE: Whip? WHIP! CHARLIE closes his eyes and says a silent prayer as he heads for the bathroom.
CHARLIE: WHIP?!!! WHIP!!! CHARLIE turns WHIP over to see his non-responsive face. HUGH arrives and freaks out.
WHIP?!!! WHIP!!!: CHARLIE turns WHIP over to see his non-responsive face. HUGH arrives and freaks out.
HUGH: Is he dead?
CHARLIE: I DON'T KNOW!!! IS HE DEAD?! Yes!!! I'm dead!!! CHARLIE shows immediate relief that WHIP is breathing. OFFICER EDMONDS has joined them.
HUGH: IS HE DEAD?! Yes!!! I'm dead!!! CHARLIE shows immediate relief that WHIP is breathing. OFFICER EDMONDS has joined them.
WHIP: Yes!!! I'm dead!!! CHARLIE shows immediate relief that WHIP is breathing. OFFICER EDMONDS has joined them.
OFFICER EDMONDS: Should I get an ambulance?
CHARLIE: Wait!.just wait, Charlie.let's think about this. The two stare at each other and realize they are both breathing heavily from the shock and stress of their Get him to the bed. ( to the Officer )
HUGH: Wait!.just wait, Charlie.let's think about this. The two stare at each other and realize they are both breathing heavily from the shock and stress of their Get him to the bed. ( to the Officer )
CHARLIE: Get him to the bed. ( to the Officer )
HUGH: Son of a bitch! You worthless motherfucker, what a waste! I cleared the decks for you.you piece of shit. You just fucked it all up like the piss drunk you are! HUGH grabs at WHIP's collar and WHIP actually sits up and reaches for HUGH, a nice sign of life from WHIP.
CHARLIE: WOAH!!! WOAH!!! WOAH!!! Enough! CHARLIE pulls HUGH away from WHIP who falls back on the bed.
HUGH: 9:14, the hearing is in 46 minutes.
CHARLIE: How much grace do you think we got?
WHIP: Amazing grace.how sweet the sound.that saved a wretch like me-
HUGH: Shut the fuck up you drunk.
WHIP: I once was lost and now I'm found was blind but.now.well I'm still kinda blind.
CHARLIE: We probably have an hour before we really need to get him to the hearing and it's just downstairs.
HUGH: We need a wheel chair.
WHIP: Call Harling Mays.
CHARLIE: Harling's got a wheel chair?
WHIP: Harling's got cocaine.
HUGH: Cocaine? Cocaine?! HUGH and CHARLIE exchange a desperate look.
CHARLIE: WHAT'S HIS NUMBER!? This is fucking insane. And 609-237-1184. We're in 609 so 129 Tell him I need bananas. 129
HUGH: This is fucking insane. And 609-237-1184. We're in 609 so 129 Tell him I need bananas. 129
WHIP: 609-237-1184. We're in 609 so 129 Tell him I need bananas. 129
CHARLIE: ( DIALING )
WHIP: 129 Tell him I need bananas. 129
CHARLIE: Harling? Harling this is Charlie. I'm a friend of Whip's.yeah. We need you to do a very early, very discreet.uhm.Whip needs bananas and you need to bring them to The St. Jerome Hotel downtown.how many bunches of bananas? ( Whip holds up 3 fingers ) 3 is the answer I'm getting you will be well compensated.the The St. Jerome Hotel room 1027. CHARLIE hangs up and looks at WHIP who is mostly passed out again. CHARLIE looks to HUGH.
HARLING MAYS: ( SINGING )
MOTHERFUCKER!!!: It's quiet as HARLING gives orders.
CHARLIE: All I have is a twenty.
HARLING MAYS: ( takes the card and bill ) That'll do. And I need to make a coco puff.
CHARLIE: A what? HUGH takes the smokes from CHARLIE and pulls out a cigarette. HARLING stops grinding, opens the lid and pours out a nice smooth pile of coke. He begins a masterful ballet of cocaine Millions of dollars hang in the HUGH is removing the last quarter of an inch of tobacco from the end of the cigarette.
HUGH: Millions of dollars hang in the HUGH is removing the last quarter of an inch of tobacco from the end of the cigarette.
CHARLIE: They hang on the consumption of a 300 dollar bag of cocaine. HARLING uses the credit card to groom the coke into neat piles and lines. He has a system. WHIP's head sags as he again appears ready to pass out.
HARLING MAYS: Okay Whip, just two small whiffs first.one on each side.just a Using the mirror as a tray, HARLING holds the rolled up 20 dollar bill just above the line of coke. WHIP slowly manages to place his face in position to ingest the coke. It's tense as his head wobbles. He finally zeroes in and snorts the first line. HARLING quickly switches nostrils. WHIP sniffs the other side.
WHIP: The banana boat is here.
HARLING MAYS: Nothing can keep you down dog. Nothing keeps the big dog down.
CHARLIE: Okay, we gotta go. HARLING has crafted 4 big lines now, he snorts one himself in record time. Looks to HUGH and CHARLIE.
HARLING MAYS: You guys are up.
HUGH: No, I'm good. Charlie?
CHARLIE: Are you fucking crazy? WHIP jumps in and sniffs 2 huge lines. He looks to HARLING.
WHIP: Thanks brother, I'm back.
HARLING MAYS: I love you man.
WHIP: I love you too. HUGH and CHARLIE are quiet as they watch the strange but sincere drug-fueled emotion pass between two old friends. HARLING eyes CHARLIE before handing him a baggie.
HARLING MAYS: There's a gram in here, you paid for it and he might need it. My work here is done. See you all on the dark side of the moon. HARLING leaves and our TRIO exchange looks, "Did that just EXT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL GUEST HALLWAY DAY 133 The opening bars of Joe Cocker's "Feelin' Alright" crackle 133 just before we see WHIP step out of the hotel room and begin a relatively steady strut down the hallway. Deja Vu. Sunglasses on, WHIP is backed by HUGH and CHARLIE who flank him from a few steps behind. Further back we can see that OFFICER EDWARDS also exits the room wearing latex gloves, carrying a large plastic garbage bag that obviously holds any evidence of the debauched night or the morning's INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL ELEVATOR DAY WHIP, HUGH and CHARLIE ride the elevator. WHIP is buttoning his shirt and fixing his tie. It is miraculous how the coke has revived him. A MOM and her 8 year old DAUGHTER get on the elevator.
CHARLIE: We watch as a small trickle of blood escapes from WHIP's left nostril. HUGH pulls a handkerchief from his pocket, hands it to WHIP.
HUGH: Your nose. WHIP accepts the handkerchief and wipes his nose. WHIP sees blood on the cloth and tilts his head back.
HUGH: I'm gonna head in and tell Ellen Block that we're here. HUGH hustles off as CHARLIE pulls close to WHIP.
CHARLIE: You're gonna make it. Remember, if they ask about your drinking, it's totally acceptable to say, "I don't WHIP wheels on CHARLIE and unloads with focused anger.
WHIP: Do not tell me how to lie about my drinking. I've been lying about my drinking my whole life. As we disappear in to WHIP's weary eyes we hear the distinctive sound of a jetliner screaming through the air.
ELLEN BLOCK: Those are difficult images to watch. For the record, I'm Ellen Block, Hearing Officer for this hearing. Captain Whitaker, good We see WHIP who looks rough but stable in his witness chair.
WHIP: ELLEN BLOCK
ELLEN BLOCK: What was captured on that video is that the aircraft was in a relatively stable glide just prior to the moment of impact. However, according to the data we retrieved from the cockpit data recorders, at exactly 9:34, after flying 27 minutes without incident, the transponder recorded a loss in altitude in excess of 4800 feet per minute in what is considered a "full pitch nose down" attitude. Then at 9:42, according to the data recorders, a decision was made to invert the aircraft. The NTSB has created animated simulation that I would like to play at this point. ELLEN points to the screen. An NTSB animation shows the plane pitching down and we follow it through the inversion of the plane while listening to the real audio of the flight crew. The animation has a split screen that also shows the instruments and printed text of what's being said. We hear."What's your son's name?" "Why?" "The black box" "I love you, Trevor. Be a good boy, Mommy loves you." "What are we doing?! Why would I trim down?!" "We're gonna roll it. Ready? Here we go. I've got control." That last statement seems to echo as the presentation stops and the lights come back up. We return to the hearing in ELLEN BLOCK ( CONT'D ) That audio is tragic and compelling. I chose to play that part of the cockpit recording to highlight a key moment aboard flight 227, wherein you say "We're gonna roll it, here we go, I've got control." You made a very conscious decision to invert the airplane, to roll the plane upside down. Is that correct?
WHIP: I'm not sure it was conscious. It was more of an instinct.
ELLEN BLOCK: What led to that decision? WHIP is clearly struggling in his chair. The coke got him there but it may start to fail him soon.
WHIP: I don't recall.
ELLEN BLOCK: Let me quote from an investigative summary."From 9:34 until 9:42 the events on the aircraft are".again I quote, "bold and remarkable". "By inverting the plane, Captain Whitaker arrested the descent and allowed the aircraft to level off enabling him to glide the aircraft away from any populated areas and allowing him to execute a forced landing in an open field. We hear a smattering of applause as the facts of his actions are remarkable.
WHIP: I heard a metallic bang. We pitched nose down. No control. WHIP looks ashen as the booze and chemicals are still coursing through his exhausted frame.
ELLEN BLOCK: You had no idea what was wrong with the aircraft?
WHIP: There was a lot of things wrong with that aircraft. WHIP glances towards HUGH and CHARLIE who are poker-faced.
ELLEN BLOCK: As I said before you can add any details you like to any comments I make. Do you remember any thing else that was out of the ordinary? Did you feel the flight crew was in their best shape?
WHIP: ELLEN BLOCK
ELLEN BLOCK: It was raining very hard the morning you took off, wasn't it?
WHIP: There was some convective activity in the area. However, my first officer and I discussed the conditions on the field and determined that we were safely within our visibility and crosswind Yes, first officer Evans' testimony confirms the same. WHIP goes quiet as ELLEN BLOCK looks at him over her glasses, seeing if he has any reaction. WHIP smiles.
ELLEN BLOCK: Yes, first officer Evans' testimony confirms the same. WHIP goes quiet as ELLEN BLOCK looks at him over her glasses, seeing if he has any reaction. WHIP smiles.
WHIP: I appreciate that.
ELLEN BLOCK: Mr. Whitaker, I want to talk about the days leading and hours leading up to the accident. But before I do, I want to remind you that you are under oath and any testimony that you give here today will be considered admissable in any subsequent hearings or criminal proceedings, do you understand what that means? WHIP nods.
WHIP: Yes, I understand.
ELLEN BLOCK: On the three days leading up to the day of the accident Tuesday, October 11th, Wednesday, October 12th or Thursday, October 13th of 2011 did you consume any alcohol or other intoxicating elements? WHIP takes his time.
WHIP: No. I did not.
ELLEN BLOCK: On the morning of the accident, Friday, October 14th, did you consume any alcohol or ingest any chemicals or drugs that may have impaired your ability to perform your job?
WHIP: No. I did not. ELLEN wraps up this line of questions.
ELLEN BLOCK: Mr. Whitaker, do you now or have you ever had a problem with alcohol dependency, alcoholism or drug WHIP waits for her to look at him.this takes a while.
WHIP: HUGH maintains a poker face; CHARLIE appears relieved. ELLEN sorts through her notes one last time.
ELLEN BLOCK: Okay, Mr. Whitaker, we're about ( She refers to her notes ) Due to the severe turbulence during the early part of the flight, you asked the flight crew to suspend the beverage service on the plane. Is that correct?
WHIP: Yes. I suspended the drink Are you aware that our investigators found two single- service Vodka bottles in the galley trash bin? Slides now show the TWO SMALL VODKA BOTTLES in evidence.
ELLEN BLOCK: Are you aware that our investigators found two single- service Vodka bottles in the galley trash bin? Slides now show the TWO SMALL VODKA BOTTLES in evidence.
WHIP: ELLEN BLOCK
ELLEN BLOCK: There were 5 crew members on board the flight who would have had access to the beverage trolley. Less than an hour after the accident, blood was taken from each of the crew members. Yourself.
WHIP: I am now.
ELLEN BLOCK: Miss Marquez was not only a colleague, but you knew her outside of work? Correct?
WHIP: Outside of work? Not really.
ELLEN BLOCK: Did you know Miss Marquez had a drinking problem?
WHIP: No. I did not.
ELLEN BLOCK: Did you ever see her drink to No. I did not.
WHIP: No. I did not.
ELLEN BLOCK: Did you know that she was twice treated for alcohol addiction? The last time was 16 months ago and paid for by SouthJet Airlines?
WHIP: No. I did not. A picture of Trina's beautiful smiling face FLASHES UP ON THE
ELLEN BLOCK: Is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez drank the vodka on the WHIP smiles at the photo of TRINA as if she can see him. He then shakes his head to snap from the memory of her great spirit. He gets serious as he bears his look down on ELLEN.
WHIP: Can you repeat the question?
ELLEN BLOCK: Your opinion Captain. Is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez drank on that flight? Whip shakes. He runs his trembling hand through his hair.
WHIP: I'm sorry. My what.
ELLEN BLOCK: Since her toxicology report is the only toxicology report that is admissable in this hearing, and she in fact tested positive for alcohol, is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez drank those 2 bottles of vodka on the flight? Whip drops his head and MUTTERS SOMETHING INAUDIBLE.
WHIP: I SAID.God help me.
ELLEN BLOCK: Yes, well. However, is it your Whip cuts her off.
WHIP: ( EXCESSIVELY LOUD )
ELLEN BLOCK: Excuse me, Mr. Whitaker.
WHIP: ( softly, to himself ) She saved that boy's life.
ELLEN BLOCK: Captain Whitaker can you speak
WHIP: ( LOUD AGAIN )
CHARLIE: NTSB OFFICER #2
OBJECTION!!!: NTSB OFFICER #2
WHIP: I drank the vodka bottles on the Mr. Whitaker, in light of that remark, would you like to You don't have to readdress anything. I DRANK THE VODKA!
ELLEN BLOCK: Mr. Whitaker, in light of that remark, would you like to You don't have to readdress anything. I DRANK THE VODKA!
WHIP: You don't have to readdress anything. I DRANK THE VODKA!
ELLEN BLOCK: On the three nights before the accident, October 11th-
WHIP: On October 11th, 12th and 13th and 14th I was intoxicated. I drank alcohol on all of those days. I drank to excess. Chaos erupts further as REPORTERS outnumber SECURITY. Flash bulbs pop repeatedly and large lights are aimed at the fracas on stage as video is taken of the bizarre melee.
ELLEN BLOCK: Mr. Whitaker, on the morning of
WHIP: I was drunk. I'm drunk right now, Miss Block.I'm drunk right. ( Whip finally breaks down ) I'm drunk now, because. Because I'm an alcoholic. We have pushed into a tight shot on WHIP's face as the sound in the room fades away. We stay tight on WHIP's face as he lets the moments unfold. Suddenly the noise cuts to silence. WHIP is looking at the assembly. WHIP wipes tears from his eyes. We hear WHIP's voice as the dialogue pre-laps the image of his face.
WHIP: I could not tell one more lie. And maybe I'm a sucker. Because if I had just told one more lie? I could have walked away from that whole mess and kept my wings and my false sense of pride and most importantly I would have avoided being locked up here with all of you nice folks for the last 13 months. We hear laughter as we pull out from WHIP to realize that he is in fact wearing a white penal jumpsuit and leading an AA meeting in a Federal Prison.
WHIP: I've had time to think about all of it. Doing a lot of writing. I've written letters to each of the families that lost loved ones on my flight. Some were able to hear my apology, some never will. I've also apologized to all the people who tried to help me along the way, but I couldn't or wouldn't listen, like my wife, I mean my ex ( he gets emotional ) .and my son. Again, some were able to forgive me.some never But at least I'm sober, and I'm grateful for that. Whip gives it to us straight.
GUARD: Whitaker, you got a visitor. WHIP looks at the GUARD and nods before taking a last glance at the photo of NICOLE.
GUARD: You have 40 minutes.
WHIP: Knuckles, you're looking good.
WILL: Yeah. I got it. Another beat as they can't find a way in to a conversation.
WHIP: This is a real surprise; a great surprise. I haven't seen you- WHIP chokes up. WILL nods. It's intense. WHIP motions to the table and they both sit. WILL pulls out a notebook.
WILL: College counselor thought I should come and interview you.
WHIP: Great. An interview. Okay.
WILL: I'm writing essays for college WHIP studies him and laughs.WILL nods and tries to smile.
WHIP: Listen Will, it means everything to me that you came here. You are an amazing kid and you deserve great Again WHIP has to tamp down his emotions.
WILL: So can you help me with this essay?
WHIP: Yeah. Of course. WILL pulls out a small voice recorder and clicks it on.
WILL: This essay. I have to do an essay called, "the most fascinating person I've never met." The two men just look at each other.
WHIP: And that's me? WILL nods, both men are struggling to keep it together.
WILL: Can we pick up where we left off? WHIP nods, unsure as to where this is going.
WHIP: Who are you?
WILL: Who are you?
WHIP: Good question. WHIP smiles.a great, familiar question. He begins to alternately laugh and sob as there is great relief in the promise of a connection with his son.
