FANTASTIC FOUR: Mark Frost and Michael France
REED: High open space, exposed structural elements. Obviously aimed at first time visitors to create feelings of. smallness, inadequacy.
BEN: Good thing it ain't workin. Reed, what are we doing here? This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science
REED: This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA. And Victor's not that bad. He's just a little. Larger than life.
REED: He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
BEN: You'd never know it.
REED: Reed Richards and Ben Grimm to see
FEMALE RECEPTIONIST: Executive elevator, top floor.
BEN: What's the price for a smile round here?
SHADOWED FIGURE: Turn it off. Please.
REED: But I haven't fully explained my
SHADOWED FIGURE: Yes you have. Imagination. Creativity. Passion. Those were always your trademarks.
VICTOR: But dreams don't pay the bills, do Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
REED: You remember in school we talked about working together. That's what I was about to explain.
VICTOR: So it's not my money you want. It's my toys. Tell me: if NASA doesn't trust you, why should I? That's my job. To stay a step ahead. To know what other men don't.
BEN: I can't take this.
REED: ( low, quiet ) Ben. This is business. Just work.
VICTOR: I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
BEN: Heya Susie. One more thing he's got.
SUE: Ben, it's been too long.
REED: You're, you've, I mean, how have you Never better.
SUE: Never better.
VICTOR: This isn't going to be a problem, is Not at all.
REED: Not at all.
SUE: Ancient history.
VICTOR: Good. Then you're just in time to hear the great Reed Richards ask me for help. You know, you made a lot of folks at MIT feel like a junior high science fair. So you'll excuse me if I savor the moment.
REED: You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or
VICTOR: The number's seventy-five. And it's applications and patents.
BEN: What about his first born?
REED: ( quiet ) Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.
VICTOR: Twenty-five percent of a billion is enough to keep the lights on, isn't it? Maybe even pay off your fourth mortgage on the Baxter Building.
REED: As Reed and Sue lock eyes, Ben watches Victor. Wary.
VICTOR: If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
LEONARD: And if he's not.?
VICTOR: Reed's always right. Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got.
BEN: He knew about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down
REED: Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works
BEN: Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round
REED: We got what we wanted. That's I know, I know. I'm just worried about what he wants. Speaking of You sure about this, Reed?
BEN: I know, I know. I'm just worried about what he wants. Speaking of You sure about this, Reed?
SUE: You sure about this, Reed?
REED: Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and
SUE: I was talking about us. Working
REED: ( thinking, talking fast ) Well, uh, based on our history.you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics. Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho
SUE: ( droll, a little annoyed ) Right. That's exactly what I meant. Way to not overthink it. ( to Sue ) So when do we leave?
BEN: Way to not overthink it. So when do we leave?
SUE: I'll schedule the launch. Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
REED: I, uh, think I remember the number.
SUE: It's been changed.
REED: As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission
SUE: Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother
BEN: Can't do it. I cannot do it.
REED: External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight Youthful high spirits.
BEN: No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight Youthful high spirits.
REED: Youthful high spirits.
BEN: They crashed it into a wall. A flight I'm sure he's matured since then.
REED: I'm sure he's matured since then.
BEN: Five times.
REED: I had it at four.
BEN: This makes five.
BEN: I can handle the ship. I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition. But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits. Who the hell came up with them?
SUE: Victor did.
JOHNNY: Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
REED: Wow. Fantastic.
SUE: Great minds think alike.
LEONARD: They're ready for you, sir.
VICTOR: EXT. LAKE LAUNCH FACILITY - HALLS - NIGHT Leonard leads Victor through the halls. Victor checks himself in mirrors as he walks, fixing his hair, his uniform.
LEONARD: Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share. The bank's five times It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
VICTOR: It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
LEONARD: Then what is it?
VICTOR: History, Leonard. History. Everything else is conversation. How's the other matter?
LEONARD: Harry Winston sends his regards.
VICTOR: Today we stand on the edge of a new frontier. In the furthest depths of outer space.we will find the secrets to inner space. The final key to unlocking our genetic code lies in a cosmic storm.
BEN: Isn't that your speech?
REED: He's made a few changes.
BEN: This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
REED: Victor's better at these things.
BEN: I'll be watching over you.
DEBBIE: Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
BEN: Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
DEBBIE: I don't care about rocks, I care about You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
BEN: What the hell you smiling at? Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs
JOHNNY: Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last I'm not as dumb as you look.
VICTOR: Think of a world without genetic flaws no asthma, allergies, baldness, breast cancer.
BEN: What's wrong with being bald.?
VICTOR: Darwin discovered evolution. Now we I will define it. Only in America
TO: EXT. DEEP SPACE - SAME THE SPACE STATION in the distance, rotating in orbit above Earth. THE SHUTTLE eases in and docks.
JOHNNY: ( a "dad voice": to Ben ) If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
BEN: Keep talking, there won't be a next
SUE: Long way from the projection booth at the Hayden Planetarium, isn't it? Yes. Yes it is.
REED: Yes. Yes it is.
VICTOR: ( to ground; via comm-link ) Leonard, how's the feed?
SUE: We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
BEN: Is it safe?
REED: The shields on the station should protect us.
BEN: What's wrong, Ben? Eighty-million dollars worth of equipment not enough for you?
VICTOR: What's wrong, Ben? Eighty-million dollars worth of equipment not enough for you?
REED: Let's start loading those samples. Get your suit ready, Ben.
VICTOR: So you still do all the heavy lifting?
BEN: He does the talking. I do the walking. Got it?
VICTOR: Got it. So take a walk, Ben.I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
REED: Ben and Johnny read his eyes, as we CUT TO
JOHNNY: Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
BEN: 'Course not. Strictly business.
JOHNNY: Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
BEN: Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
JOHNNY: Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
BEN: Put your tiny little mind at ease.
JOHNNY: Don't you wander off, boy.
VICTOR: Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
SUE: I understand the business reasons.
VICTOR: Well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past.
REED: No.no.impossible. It's.too
VICTOR: You've been with me two years now.
SUE: It's been a good two years, Victor. The company's accomplished so much.
VICTOR: Right, of course, the company. But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think.
SUE: Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think.
VICTOR: Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this as a promotion. A merger of Four little words that can change our
REED: The cloud is accelerating!
VICTOR: Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the Ben's still out there
REED: Ben's still out there
VICTOR: So reel him in. But we came here to do a job. So let's do it. Quickly.
AUTOMATED VOICE: Event threshold in two minutes.
REED: Come on, Ben, come on.
SUE: Johnny. Reed.
VICTOR: Reed, you need to get up here so we can close the shields! Now!
VICTOR: It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
SUE: What are you doing?
VICTOR: Raising the shields.
SUE: You can't leave them out there.
VICTOR: Watch me. Reed had his chance. You can't help them any more than I can. I can try.
SUE: I can try.
REED: Victor's right. Johnny, get to the command center. Close the shields.
JOHNNY: What about you?
AUTOMATED VOICE: Event threshold in thirty seconds.
AUTOMATED VOICE: Event threshold in ten seconds.
SUE: Johnny! Reed!
AUTOMATED VOICE: SLOW MOTION: Everyone frozen in position as: JOHNNY is hit with sparks of flame from a control panel. REED REACHES out for Ben and the airlock door. VAPOR STREAM pours down on Sue from a blown gasket. THE SPACE DUST burns into Ben's skin. SLOW MOTION: Just BEFORE the exterior air-lock door closes, a SINGLE PARTICLE zips through the narrowing gap and hits Ben in the back, ripping through his suit. The exterior door shuts and seals. The station loses all power. DARKNESS.
REED: He's not responsive
JOHNNY: Ben! Ben!
JOHNNY'S VOICE: Ben, wake up! Wake up!
JOHNNY: Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility. We're in quarantine.
JOHNNY: They're fine. Everybody else.is

JOHNNY: Nice 'do. Going for the "grandpa"
REPORTER #1: You've been accused in the past of moving science a little too fast
VICTOR: Accused by who? My competitors?
REPORTER #2: But surely this accident gives you Danger is always part of discovery. What would have happened if Ben Franklin never went out in a storm? Without risk, there's no reward.
VICTOR: Danger is always part of discovery. What would have happened if Ben Franklin never went out in a storm? Without risk, there's no reward.
REPORTER #3: So where's the reward? You promised a

DOCTOR: Stable. Vitals are strong.
REED: Blood panels show no irradiation. Good. You'll step up this protocol, Four hours. We know what we're doing. One more day of observation, then you're all cleared.
DOCTOR: Four hours. We know what we're doing. One more day of observation, then you're all cleared.
REED: Sue.I want to tell you.I'm.
SEXY NURSE: And where do we think we're going?

NURSE: I've noticed. But doctor's orders, you're not allowed to leave until we

NURSE: You know this is not a ski resort.
JOHNNY: Not yet.
NURSE: You are trouble.
JOHNNY: ( thermometer in his mouth ) Brubbles my Triddle Name.
SEXY NURSE: You're hot!
JOHNNY: So are you!
SEXY NURSE: I mean, you feel a little feverish.
JOHNNY: I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
SEXY NURSE: My shift ends at four, but I couldn't
JOHNNY: Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen
BEN: How long was I out?
REED: Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
BEN: Ben can see Reed doesn't look too solid.
REED: I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.
BEN: Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
REED: I should have done more, run more
BEN: It was a freak of nature. Last I checked, you don't have a crystal ball. Let it go. You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
REED: Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect
BEN: Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
REED: What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor
BEN: I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
REED: He's smart, powerful, successful
BEN: Well maybe you should date him.
REED: Ben. He'll give her the life she deserves. She ended up with the right guy. Things worked out for the best.
BEN: Do I have to do everything myself?
JOHNNY: Me like-y.
SEXY NURSE: Stay right. Left is trouble.
JOHNNY: I though we went over this.
SEXY NURSE: Last one down springs for room
SEXY NURSE: You're on fire!
JOHNNY: Not this again
SEXY NURSE: No: You're ON FIRE!
JOHNNY: Care to join me?
VICTOR: How's the IPO?
LEONARD: Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from
VICTOR: Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
LEONARD: Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself
VICTOR: Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal. I've got to do something about this scar. Make sure they only shoot my right side.
LEONARD: Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
VICTOR: And that's a good thing? You know, maybe you should get some Later. First, I've got some unfinished business. A deal that needs closing.
LEONARD: You know, maybe you should get some Later. First, I've got some unfinished business. A deal that needs closing.
VICTOR: Later. First, I've got some unfinished business. A deal that needs closing.
LEONARD: Sir, I've always wondered. Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world That's why. Because I could have any other woman. You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not mine."
VICTOR: That's why. Because I could have any other woman. You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not mine."
SUE: I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
BEN: Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
BEN: Pardon me.
REED: Are you alright?
BEN: I think I need to lie down. Bad
REED: Feeling better?
SUE: Yes, thanks.
REED: That's good. That's uh.good.
SUE: You always had a way with words. I should be getting back.
REED: I'm really happy for you and Victor.
SUE: You're happy for me and Victor.
REED: I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship
SUE: Which was?
REED: We see surprise on Sue's face, and.
SUE: ( frustrated ) You are such a dork, Reed. You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
REED: What? What did I say?
SUE: It's never what you say. It's what you don't say. What you don't do.
REED: I.I.I just wanted to
SUE: It's been two years, and all you can say is you're happy for me and some other guy. You know, Victor may be a lot of things, but at least he's not afraid to fight for what he wants. And it's nice to be wanted sometimes. To be heard.seen. Reed, look at
REED: Uh, Sue.? I can't.
SUE: What? What do you mean you
REED: Sue.look at your hands.
SUE: It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
REED: Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap.
JOHNNY: Now what is up with that?
REED: ( deadpan ) The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
JOHNNY: Cool. What'd it do to you guys?
SUE: Apparently I can disappear.
JOHNNY: Please tell me you go silent too.
REED: We have to find Ben.
JOHNNY: Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame
SUE: He does it again. Flame on, flame off.
JOHNNY: Okay, "mom."
BEN: LEAVE ME ALONE!!!
JOHNNY: Ewwwwwwww. That is disgusting.
REED: Their eyes adjust; there's a huge hole where the window used to be. They rush to it. Looking out they see SOMETHING LARGE in the distance, running away.
JOHNNY: What is that thing?
SUE: I think that thing is Ben.
VICTOR: What's going on?
SUE: Victor, are you feeling alright?
VICTOR: Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
REED: Ben did this.
VICTOR: Ben did this?
REED: He's had some kind of.reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.
SUE: We need to find him.
VICTOR: ( cold ) Just find him.
JOHNNY: Anybody know where the big guy's
REED: He's going home.
BEN: Hello, Operator?
DEBBIE: Out front? You home, baby? I got a surprise for you.
BEN: I got a surprise for you too.
DEBBIE: BEN ( O.S. )
DEBBIE: Baby, you're scaring me. Oh my G-g-g. What did you.do to Deb, it's me. It's still me. Don't.don't.DON'T TOUCH ME!
DEBBIE: Oh my G-g-g. What did you.do to Deb, it's me. It's still me. Don't.don't.DON'T TOUCH ME!
BEN: Deb, it's me. It's still me. Don't.don't.DON'T TOUCH ME!
DEBBIE: Don't.don't.DON'T TOUCH ME!
BEN: I love you, Deb.
VICTOR: Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here. And keep it quiet. I don't need this to hit the press.
LEONARD: Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal
VICTOR: Front page?
LEONARD: Top left, like you asked. Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows.maybe Washington.
VICTOR: Leonard. Think bigger.
BEN: A few days in space, it'll be great, what's the worst that could happen?
BEN: A little help here?! You wanna hit that button, sir?
COP: FREEZE! PUT THE MAN AND THE SEAT
DOWN!: Ben looks at the cops. PEDESTRIANS stare, point. He realizes how this must look a monster holding a bloody man in hand.
JOHNNY: Not even Ben deserves that.
BRIDGE COP: Back! We're evac-ing the bridge.
SUE: What now? Reed.? What do we do?
BRIDGE COP: Maybe you didn't hear me. Those cars are gonna blow sky high, any second.
REED: Look, we've got a friend out there in trouble. We need to get to him before
SUE: ( mutters ) We need to get past them.
REED: ( mutters ) We need to get past them.
REED: Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.
SUE: ( realizes )
JOHNNY: This is wrong in so many ways.
REED: You've been working out.
SUE: Shut up.
REED: Uh, Sue?
JOHNNY: I'm gonna need serious therapy.
BEN: What the !
REED: Ben. Are you okay?
BEN: Am I okay?! You wanna explain that?!
REED: I swear to you, I will do everything in my power until there is not a breath left in me: you are going to be Ben again.
LEONARD: Uh, sir.Larry King called, to Apparently, there's a bigger story.
CHIEF FIREMAN: There's some folks outside, want to talk to you.
REED: We're not going public with this. We're scientists, not celebrities.
CHIEF FIREMAN: Too late, son.
JOHNNY: Johnny heads for the exit.
SUE: Johnny, slow down. Let's think this through, a second.
JOHNNY: Okay. Done thinking.
CHIEF FIREMAN: So which one of you's the leader?
JOHNNY: That'd be me.
CHIEF FIREMAN: No seriously. You're on, son. They all want a

VARIOUS REPORTERS: What happened on the bridge? Does it hurt to stretch? Were you really on fire? Is it true that one of you can Working on it. And it's a lot harder
JOHNNY: Working on it. And it's a lot harder
SUE: We don't know much more than you do, at this point. Which is why we will be going directly to the lab, where we can diagnose our symptoms and
REPORTER #2: Symptoms? So it's like a disease?
JOHNNY: Symptoms? Please. If having powers is a disease, then yeah we got it. And we are gonna blow your minds. There's a new day dawning. The day of the Fantastic Four.
REPORTER #3: That thing doesn't look too fantastic.

JOHNNY: What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot.

BEN: Be nice.
NED CECIL: Well, Victor, the bank would like to congratulate you. On the fastest freefall since the Depression. We can't even give your stock away.
VICTOR: Ned, you know I can turn this around.
NED CECIL: You promised a cure-all, and came back with this. Who the hell's going to invest in a biotech company that turns its workers into circus freaks?
VICTOR: ( pointed ) I really appreciate all your support.
NED CECIL: You've got a week, Victor. One week to turn this around. Or we pull This meeting is over.
VICTOR: Goddamn book-keeper doesn't know preferred stock from livestock.
LEONARD: Sir. Reed's comments at that press conference killed us. How are we going to turn this around?
VICTOR: Very simple. I cure them. If I can cure these freaks, then I can cure anyone. What better way to restore my
JOHNNY: Smile, Ben. They want to like you. Give 'em your good side. Or your less bad side.
BEN: Uh.don't do drugs.
O'HOOLIHAN: Welcome back to the Baxter, Dr. Richards. All that for you?
REED: I'm afraid so.
SUE: Jimmy. Good to see you again.
O'HOOLIHAN: Good to see you too. Don't worry, sir. I know how crowded that head of yours is.
REED: Any visitors while I was away?
O'HOOLIHAN: Just the usual. Told 'em you were circling round outer space.
REED: We had a tough year.
BEN: Yeah, nine years straight.
JOHNNY: Twenty? From outside the place looks a lot taller.
REED: Oh, it is.
JOHNNY: Either we're moving really fast.or not at all.
BEN: I'll take the stairs.
SUE: How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
REED: That's what we're here to find out.
SUE: If it happened to him, then it
JOHNNY: Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
SUE: Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your Is that a trick question? C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
JOHNNY: Is that a trick question? C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
REED: We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes.
JOHNNY: This place is deluxe. You got cable?
REED: ( hearing Ben's FOOTSTEPS ) .and figure out how to reverse them. Let me show you to your rooms.
VICTOR: God, I've been so worried about you.
SUE: Victor, your scar
VICTOR: I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
SUE: I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to
VICTOR: Please, no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care.
SUE: Thank you, that's generous, but I think I should stay here. With my brother. Until we get a handle on
VICTOR: Sue. I think you should let my doctors have a look at you.
VICTOR: I'm starting to wonder the same thing. How much do you know about what happened to you?
REED: Not much. We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
VICTOR: Well, let me know if there is anything I can do. We're all in this together Victor wait. I just wanted to say, I'm sorry the mission didn't go as
REED: Victor wait. I just wanted to say, I'm sorry the mission didn't go as
VICTOR: Didn't go as planned? It was a catastrophe. You ruined the lives of four people
REED: I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort
VICTOR: Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool
REED: Victor, if we could understand what happened to us
VICTOR: I don't want to understand it. This isn't one of your science projects. I just want to fix it. Fast!
VICTOR: No problem, Ben.
BEN: You got a chisel round here?
REED: If we're going to identify the source of the mutation, we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
SUE: We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
BEN: Well why didn't you say so? You want me to lift some weights or something?
REED: No, just sit back. We have a good sense of your strength from the firetruck. We need to find the source of your strength.
BEN: How bad is it? You know I used to
REED: Okay, this might smart a little. We'll.continue this later.
REED: Back it down, Johnny!
JOHNNY: I can go hotter!
SUE: You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova
JOHNNY: That's the temperature of the sun.
SUE: That's the temperature of the sun.
REED: Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
JOHNNY: Gotcha. Okay. Supernova bad.
SUE: He cooked the equipment.
REED: Okay. I've uh, got some questions, from Sue. That she thought might be better coming from me. Can you, you know, go to the bathroom.like You don't wanna know the details.
BEN: ( a beat ) You don't wanna know the details.

JOHNNY: Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're.well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through. And Ben's always been a hardass. Why aren't you writing this down?
REED: It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. That's what you projected on the Bridge.
SUE: What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
REED: Have you had any side-effects, from your powers?
SUE: I've had some headaches. Migraines.
REED: You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state Excuse me?
SUE: Excuse me?
REED: I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger. Can you remember the exact emotions when

REED: I think it was a little more complicated than
SUE: I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
REED: There were a lot of variables to No. There weren't. There was you. And me. No variables, no math. It was actually the simplest thing in the world. But your head got in the way. like it always does.
SUE: No. There weren't. There was you. And me. No variables, no math. It was actually the simplest thing in the world. But your head got in the way. like it always does.
REED: Sue.I just.I thought.
SUE: Same old Reed. Too much thinking.
JOHNNY: Okay guys, we have a serious problem.
BEN: You look like an eighties rock band.
SUE: ( to Ben ) The suit will stretch. You should try I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
BEN: I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
JOHNNY: He's right. These costumes are. missing something. I can't put my finger on it
REED: They're not costumes.
SUE: We're not taking them out. Johnny, we need to stay here till we've stabilized.
JOHNNY: I'm getting sick of being trapped here. NASA wasn't even this strict!
BEN: ( looking at uniform ) Maybe it's missing a utility belt.
DOCTOR: Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, And they're changing into.
VICTOR: And they're changing into.
DOCTOR: I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than Like the shields Reed said would protect us. How long?
VICTOR: Like the shields Reed said would protect us. How long?
DOCTOR: At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks
VICTOR: What do you mean "complete"?
DOCTOR: I wish I could tell you. I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here. I'll notify the CDC and
VICTOR: The Center for Disease Control. If this thing is contagious
DOCTOR: The Center for Disease Control. If this thing is contagious
VICTOR: Look at me. I have a life. I'm the face of a billion-dollar-company. We need to keep this confidential,
DOCTOR: But.this disease.is progressive. That's terrible news.
VICTOR: That's terrible news.
REED: He hits the end of the slides. The wall fills with white light. Frustrated, Reed SLAMS his head into his desk, CRASH! Something FALLS off the end of the desk. Reed raises his head, revealing his flattened face. He steps over to see.a PLANT SAMPLE from space, glass box shattered. Red sparks swirl around the plant, like the cosmic storm
SUE: What are you doing?
REED: ( fast, charged ) The plants, from space. Their particles are still charged. With the right amount of energy, those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
REED: If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity
SUE: ( realizing ) And reverse the mutations
REED: ( talking more to himself ) Curing countless diseases, not just
SUE: But we're the focus, right Reed? Of course. Of course.
REED: Of course. Of course.
SUE: And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid.
REED: ( preoccupied, mind With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid.
SUE: You really need to get a janitor.
REED: There's a system to it.
SUE: Sorry. My fault. I won't.touch
LEONARD: Is Reed any closer to a cure?
VICTOR: The only thing he's closer to is
THE THING: God. I was good looking. What did you wish for, honey?
JOHNNY: How far's that rubber bend?
REED: That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber. It's muscle, tendon. I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to
JOHNNY: Right, whatever, have fun.
BEN: That's not funny!
ERNIE: Hey, that's Ben Grimm there, the first mook from Brooklyn to go to outer space, so pay him some respect!
BEN: Ernie. Sorry for killing your business. I'll take the usual, then I'm out. Better make it a double.
ALICIA: Who killed the party?
BEN: If there's a God, she hates me.
ALICIA: I don't think She's real big on hate.
BEN: You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
ALICIA: Can I.? See you.?
BEN: Trust me, this ain't one of those
ALICIA: See you round, Benny.
VICTOR: Thank you for coming out to see me.
SUE: You said it was urgent.
VICTOR: It is. There's something we need to talk about. Something I need to ask
SUE: ( slow, careful ) Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't
VICTOR: Susan. What are you doing?
SUE: He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?
VICTOR: Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?
SUE: If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass. It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him.because you're his science project.
VICTOR: Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass. It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him.because you're his science project.
SUE: Please don't make this personal
VICTOR: Oh, I think you already have.
SUE: Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready.
VICTOR: "We," huh?
BUSINESSMAN: I wish my wife would disappear.
INTO: EXT. NYC ARENA - ESPN MOTO X GAMES - DAY The X games in full effect: A maze of mountainous dirt hills and ramps.where MOTO-BIKES launch into the air to the delight of 20,000 fans. The Riders spin and flip, performing aerial acrobatics on their 250CC motor bikes.
JOHNNY: Hey, Ronnie Renner! I'm a big fan.
KENNY BARTRAM: Heard you like to ride. Wanna take her for a spin?
RONNIE RENNER: Come on, bro. I'll teach you some tricks.if you can keep up.
FLAMING BLUR!: And now for the really impressive part: Johnny's bike starts to drop, but JOHNNY KEEPS RISING! He FLAMES ON, spiraling upward! For a few seconds, he's actually.almost.flying.
JOHNNY: My bad. Sorry about that. Thanks for the lesson, bro.
SUE: That's new.
REED: No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
SUE: We're not specimens, we're patients. This isn't just another science project to you, is it.?
REED: BEN! What? What's going on!?
SUE: He didn't.
BEN: Oh, he did.
SUE: What did he do to the uniform?!
REED: He talked me into it.
SUE: X-GAMES REPORTER ( ON TV )
JOHNNY: Well, I wouldn't say he's the leader.
BEN: Could be worse.
JOHNNY: That's it. Just The Thing. We would have gone with The Rock, but it was taken. And "Thing" pretty much sums it up.
BEN: ( matter-of-fact ) Okay. I'm gonna go kill him now.
REED: Ben! Slow down a second and
REED: ( finishing his thought to Ben ) .wait for me.
SUE: I'm driving.
JOHNNY: ( looking around ) Where's my ride?
SUE: You gave us names? What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
BEN: It's about to be a broken face.
REED: This isn't permanent, Johnny. We need to be careful until we're normal What if some of us don't want to be "normal" again? We didn't all turn into monsters like
JOHNNY: What if some of us don't want to be "normal" again? We didn't all turn into monsters like
BEN: Did you just
JOHNNY: Let's see if we can get blood from a You two need a time-out.
SUE: You two need a time-out.
JOHNNY: Blockhead started it!
SUE: Damn it, Johnny.
REED: You need to control yourself and think before you
JOHNNY: Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if we have some, you know.like, A higher calling like getting girls and making money?
REED: A higher calling like getting girls and making money?
JOHNNY: Is there any higher? This is who we are Reed. Accept it. Or better yet: enjoy it.
SUE: Ben! Slow down.
BEN: It's not him. It's them. I can't live like this.
SUE: Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works analyzing every little step before he takes It's easy for you to be patient.
BEN: It's easy for you to be patient.
SUE: No, it's not. I thought I was done waiting for Reed. We're all in this together now, Ben.
BEN: Together? Look at me, Susie. You got no idea what I'd give.to be invisible. Your nightmare.is my
TO: INT. INVESTMENT BANK - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY The news plays on the TV. Head Banker Ned Cecil freezes the screen on an image of.THE THING. He turns to Victor, who sits with the rest of the bankers. Cold, sterile Victor has a larger bandage on his face now.
NED CECIL: This is how you "turn things around"? These freaks are on the front page and your company's in the obituaries.
VICTOR: I have a plan to use their publicity Victor, stop. The bank's lost enough already. This isn't a negotiation. It's a notification. We're pulling
NED CECIL: Victor, stop. The bank's lost enough already. This isn't a negotiation. It's a notification. We're pulling
VICTOR: You need to look long-term here. Without risk, there's no
NED CECIL: Reward. We all know the sales pitch, Vic. And frankly, we're done buying. Gentlemen.
NED CECIL: A hanging beat. Victor steps out from shadows.
VICTOR: It's pronounced Latveria. This meeting's over, Ned.
LEONARD: Sir, is everything okay? What happened to your.?
VICTOR: ( under breath, seething ) Reed. He got what he wanted. ( looking at Sue ) Everything he wanted.he took from me.
REED: Victor, are you.are you okay?
VICTOR: Don't worry about me. Worry about
REED: What are you doing here?
VICTOR: What I should have done a long time ago. Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.
REED: But I'm not done with the machine
VICTOR: Which is precisely the point. Analysis is over. It's time for action. My men could have mass- produced this by now.
REED: Mass-produced? This isn't a toaster. You have no idea how it
VICTOR: Re-create the storm, invert the polarity here, reverse the mutation there. Don't talk to me like I'm some schoolboy. I've got the same Phd you
REED: The storm needs to be handled exactly right, or it could make our mutations worse, much worse, maybe even kill
VICTOR: Reed. I'm not asking permission. We'll build it, while you check the
SUE: Can I talk to you?
SUE: Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake
REED: He was going to take away all my data, Better than your life. Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing. We are.
SUE: Better than your life. Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing. We are.
REED: Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable
SUE: Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like
REED: ( finally losing it ) I'm not the only one in there. I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.
SUE: So clear it out. Get out of your head. Get out of here.
LITTLE GIRL: Mister, Mister! Please help me! My kitty is stuck in a tree.
BEN: ( under breath ) Eyebrows are a little big.
BEN: How'd you know it was me?
ALICIA: I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
BEN: I'm not really dressed for a party.
ALICIA: Relax, it's casual.
BEN: No, I mean.I'm a little.dusty.
BEN: Those yours too?
ALICIA: My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.
THE THING: You know, you could'a run an ad in the "Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual This ain't permanent. My friend Reed's working on a cure.I think.
ALICIA: "Sensual blind chick seeks three-ton, rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual This ain't permanent. My friend Reed's working on a cure.I think.
THE THING: This ain't permanent. My friend Reed's working on a cure.I think.
ALICIA: Bennie. You feel pretty good as is.
THE THING: You don't know what it's like out there. Walking around like some kind of circus freak. People staring, I wouldn't know anything about that.
ALICIA: I wouldn't know anything about that.
THE THING: I mean.
ALICIA: Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you You went your own way then. You didn't listen to people. So why start
VICTOR: Need a ride, Johnny?
VICTOR: A few fans. Hope you don't mind.
JOHNNY: Gotta take care of the fans, right?
VICTOR: Look, I built my business knowing what people want. And right now, the people want you.
JOHNNY: And we don't want to let the people down now, do we?
VICTOR: No we don't. Which is why we need to strike while the iron's hot. I'm talking action figures, videogames, sponsors
JOHNNY: Videogames? You serious?
VICTOR: Johnny. Let's be honest here. Ben, Reed, Sue. Good people, all. But I don't want to break up the band, but you're the one they want. Don't you think it's time to go solo.?
REED: I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look
SUE: Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look
REED: You were?
SUE: Of course I was. I'd read all your papers on bioethics. Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.
REED: You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
SUE: I gave him twenty.
REED: Sue, you were right. It wasn't complicated. I just wasn't ready to be.to become. You can be a little intimidating.
SUE: I did. I did, Reed.but I wanted you to be that man.
REED: Why didn't you say something?
SUE: That would have kinda defeated the purpose. And Reed. I'm saying it now. Come find me.
ALICIA: Look around. I'll get us drinks. They always let blind girls cut the
PATRON: I don't know about this one. It lacks a certain.realism.
BEN: What are you doing here?
VICTOR: I'm worried about you.
BEN: About me? How sweet.
VICTOR: Come on. Let me buy you something to eat. Looks like you could use the
THE THING: 'Scuse me.
VICTOR: I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back.
THE THING: If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job
VICTOR: I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love. To see it slip away, and know it's never coming
THE THING: Reed's gonna fix me up
VICTOR: For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little Look, he's a brilliant man, we should trust he's working as hard as he can. You're his best friend. So what possible reason could he have for taking his time? I mean, other than getting close to
THE THING: Ben doesn't trust him. But Victor is hitting pressure Off The Thing: a seed of doubt has been planted. He can't help but find truth in the words. And we CUT TO
VICTOR: Look, he's a brilliant man, we should trust he's working as hard as he can. You're his best friend. So what possible reason could he have for taking his time? I mean, other than getting close to
BEN: Yeah, I have that effect on people.
REED: Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body?
BEN: Oh, you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body?
REED: We're working as hard as we can
BEN: Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.
REED: Come on, this is nothing.
BEN: Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
REED: Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe
BEN: Look at me, Reed. Look at me!
REED: I am looking. That's why I can't make a mistake! I've got to get it right, and it's not right yet! We need to test this.
BEN: I spent my whole life protecting you, from the schoolyard to the stars. For what? So you could play Twister with your girlfriend while I'm the freak of the week?
SUE: Ben! Stop it! Or I'll stop it.
BEN: Stay out of this Susie.
REED: I'm OK. Just go, go after him. Stop
JOHNNY: Christmas come early! Check it out!
JOHNNY: Hey! That's a prototype!
BEN: Go back to the drawing board.
SUE: Johnny? Did you see Ben?
JOHNNY: Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.
SUE: Is that what you call it? "Real"?
JOHNNY: At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
SUE: Johnny, slow down. Think. You know mom didn't raise us to
JOHNNY: Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy
SUE: As soon as you stop acting like one. Come on, you're smarter than this. You think those people out there care about you? You're just a fad to them.
JOHNNY: Let's try something new: you live your life. And I'll live mine. And just for the record: they LOVE
SUE: Oh god, Reed.
SUE: What did you do, Reed? What did you
REED: I can.make it work.
SUE: Reed, stop, you need to rest your
REED: The power.I need.more power.to control.the storm
SUE: You need a doctor.
VICTOR: More power.?
LEONARD: Ben! They need you back at the Baxter building. It's.Reed.
IN: INT. MANHATTAN NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT LOUD MUSIC and PULSATING LIGHTS. A young crowd dances and grinds to the beat. Among the colorful lights, STREAKS OF FLAME swirl around the ceiling. We follow them to: A BALCONY, where we see JOHNNY sitting in a cozy VIP section. He's surrounded by "groupies" climbing over each other to get a look at his various parlour tricks. He leans closer to a YOUNG WOMAN. Closer. Candles around them start to melt. Beads of sweat drip down her face.
JOHNNY: What do you say we get out of here?
BOYFRIEND: Is that all you do? Bar tricks and stealing chicks.
GIRLFRIEND: What are you doing?! You could have burned somebody!
VICTOR: Ben, come in.
BEN: What is this? Where's Reed?
VICTOR: Where do you think? With Sue. I'll take it from here, Leonard.
LEONARD: Yes sir.
BEN: What do you want, Vic?
VICTOR: To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.
BEN: Reed said it'd be weeks till
VICTOR: He also said we'd avoid that storm in space. And we know how that turned
BEN: And you can? Power it up?
VICTOR: Yes. I've found a new energy source.
BEN: Let's do it.
BEN: Oh my God. Th-thank you. THANK
YOU.VIC?!: Ben sees a SPARK in shadows. That spark is. VICTOR'S ARM. Victor steps forward, and reveals himself to Ben: ELECTRICITY PUMPS THROUGH HIS BODY. His skin is part flesh, part metal. Cheekbone exposed, steel tissue.
DOOM: Everyone thought I was safe behind those shields.
BEN: Victor, the machine worked for me. It can work for you
DOOM: It did, Ben. It worked perfectly.
BEN: You planned this.?
DOOM: I've always wanted power. Now I've got an unlimited supply.
BEN: And no Thing to stand in your way.
DOOM: Take a good look, Ben. This is what a man looks like who embraces his
REED: Oh god Ben. Are you okay? You did it, you really did it.
DOOM: No, Reed. I did.
REED: Victor.? What, what happened to you? What did you do to your
DOOM: Exactly what I said I would: I built a better, stronger being. And outsmarted the great Reed Richards
REED: Victor, this isn't the way to
DOOM: ( a dark smile ) You always know best. So tell me. What happens when you superheat
O'HOOLIHAN: Mr. Von Doom? Are you oka
DOOM: Never better, Jimmy. And it's Doctor Doom now.
DOOM: Why the long face?
SUE: She helps him out of the rubble. He is beaten, battered.
SUE: No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
JOHNNY: Jesus, Ben! I go away, look what happens. You got a lot of explaining to do.
BEN: ( struggling, weak ) The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us
JOHNNY: Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.
SUE: Where is Reed?
BEN: Victor must've taken him.
DOOM: Chemistry 101, Part Two. What happens to rubber when it's super-
JOHNNY: Great. Heat-seeker.
SUE: What are you doing
JOHNNY: Sis. Let me take care of you for But Johnny.you can't fly.
SUE: But Johnny.you can't fly.
JOHNNY: Well then this'll be one hell of a
FLYING!: JOHNNY ( CONT'D )
BEN: We need to help Reed
SUE: Ben, you got what we all wanted. You need to stay here. It's too
BEN: What.what have I done?
SUE: What has he done to you?
SUE: Victor, please
DOOM: It's Doctor Doom to you.
SUE: We know the machine works. It worked on Ben, it'll work on you. We can turn you back
DOOM: Do you really think fate turned us into gods so we could refuse these
SUE: Victor. You always thought you were
DOOM: Sue please, let's not fight.
SUE: No, Victor. Let's.
DOOM: Susan.. You're fired.
DOOM: One more down. Now it's just the scientist and his specimen.
REED: Sue. The only thing I ever knew without thinking was.
SUE: Me too, Reed.
DOOM: ( quiet, cruel ) And so four became none. It's my time
BEN: IT'S CLOBBERING TIME!
BEN: Excuse me, Maam. Can I borrow your
OLD LADY: The clutch sticks a little.
BEN: Not gonna be a problem.
DOOM: And you can't stop me.
JOHNNY: Had a little relapse, huh?
DOOM: This is going to be fun.
REED: JOHNNY! SPOT-WELD!
SUE: Doom smiles. Reed sees her. She is about to drop her hands, vulnerable, but......REED STRETCHES HIS WHOLE BODY! He EXPANDS himself across the street, and GRABS a TREE, so he forms a WALL between Sue and Doom. Doom keeps FIRING his bolts. They SLAM into Reed's body, RUBBERBAND his skin, and DISTEND OUT his back without breaking. He strains, agonizing.
REED: Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
JOHNNY: But all these people.
REED: Johnny charges toward Doom flames on his body starting build to a blinding white intensity, ENGULFING everything. Johnny GRABS DOOM.
THING: ( quiet, smiling ) Flame on, kid.
REED: Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, I'm sure I can come up with something.
SUE: ( looking at Doom ) I'm sure I can come up with something.
DOOM: Is that the best you can do.? A little heat.?
REED: Time for your lesson, Vic. Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot Got it, teach.
BEN: Got it, teach.
DOOM: Doom RUSHES TOWARD Reed, but the WATER FLIES OUT, DOUSING DOOM. GIANT CLOUDS OF STEAM fill the air from the cooling metal. DOOM screams. His shrieks finally fade to SILENCE. The water stops, thick steam clouds roll, completely obscuring Doom from view. A beat. The steam clears to DOOM. A true statue now a hard, cold solid piece of METAL. Frozen forever. Reed, Sue, Ben, and Johnny The Fantastic Four exhale. They stand as one, in roiling smoke. A beat.
JOHNNY: Damn, I love this job.
BEN: Job, huh.?
REED: Well, we do have the suits.
SUE: You know, about what we said up there, I think maybe Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
BEN: Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
SUE: As they kiss, people emerge, stepping out of hiding. The sun rises around them. The Fantastic Four step into the new dawn of a new day. And we slowly DISSOLVE TO
REED: Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine. I think if we can rework the power settings.
BEN: Forget it, egghead. I'm good as is.
BEN: I like the sound of that.
REED: Sue, can I talk to you for a second?
REED: I found a broken gasket, from space
SUE: A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
REED: If one of us were to wear it.
SUE: Reed. What are you doing?
REED: No more thinking, no more variables. Sue Storm.will you. Sue? Sue? You there?
BEN: No more cracks about how I look.
JOHNNY: Hey, I'm Mr. Sensitivity now. Clear the way, wide load coming
BEN: People drink, laugh, dance. We slowly PULL BACK from the party, the boat, the city, and.CUT TO
