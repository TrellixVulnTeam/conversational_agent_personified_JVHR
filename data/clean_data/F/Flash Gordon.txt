FLASH GORDON: Written by Lorenzo Semple Jr.
FLASH: What was that, fellas?
PILOT: Clear-air turbulence, is all. Nothing
SERIOUS: But nothing you'd want to toss a third-down pass through either ( Grinning back at
FLASH ): Can I have an autograph for my kid, Mr. Gordon?
FLASH: Sure my pleasure. As FLASH takes a bit of paper from the CO-PILOT, the plane takes another jolt, even more violent than the first.
PILOT: Wow. Call Westchester Approach, see what they've got.
FLASH: I sure hope we don't have to turn back. I mean this is first day of training camp, I wouldn't want to be
LATE: Seat-belt time. FLASH starts back to his seat. The plane jumps again, shudders violently. He holds on, calls up front:
PILOT: Seat-belt time. FLASH starts back to his seat. The plane jumps again, shudders violently. He holds on, calls up front:
FLASH: Maybe it'd be smoother if you went
HIGHER: Will you SHUT UP? ( as FLASH's head
DALE: Will you SHUT UP? ( as FLASH's head
SWIVELS ): Look, Mister Flash Gordon, they have their hands full just let 'em INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS ( DALE, FLASH ) The plane buffets. FLASH is sent reeling, catches hold of the rack above DALE, lowers himself into the seat next to her. He buckles fast, takes out a candy bar and offers it to her.
FLASH: When you're nervous, it can help to chew on something
DALE: Thanks a lot I look dumb enough to take candy from a stranger?
FLASH: I'm not a stranger exactly You know my name.
DALE: Who doesn't. Number one draft pick, cover of PEOPLE mag what'd the GIANTS sign you for, eighty-nine million? Big deal!
FLASH: Of course.
DALE: God, I hate flying I'm Dale Arden it's crazy of me to hate flying I'm a travel agent, you see? I've just been checking out a little hotel in Vermont can I still have that candy bar? ( and in the same breath ) Are we going backward?
FLASH: DALE ( GASP )
TV NEWSMAN: The extraordinary weather disturbances reported from Africa this morning are now crossing the Atlantic, and are expected to reach the East Coast of the United States by noon. According to scientists at NASA, the Earth is being struck by an immense stream of cosmic energy, apparently the result of some catastrophic stellar accident beyond the reaches
OF: ZARKOV whirls, slams the TV SOUND OFF and yells at the silently mouthing NEWSMAN on the screen.
ZARKOV: Fools! Can't you understand? This is no accident it's an ATTACK! An attack planned by a MIND! This is
ATTACK!: MUNSON, a scared looking assistant, comes running up the stairs with a computer print-out sheet.
MUNSON: Dr. Zarkov! Look at the report from the last balloon! ZARKOV grabs it, eyes it.
ZARKOV: I predicted it, didn't I?
MUNSON: Yes, sir you sure did. And this funny sun too -
ZARKOV: Ozone layer starting to crack up. By tonight Carbon dioxide will be combining with free nitrogen to form ( breaks off, crumpling
MUNSON: Sir, the President is on the TV behind
YOU: What the hell do I care? I tried to warn him he called me mad, like all the others. BOOM! The TV screen EXPLODES in a fine shower of glass.
ZARKOV: What the hell do I care? I tried to warn him he called me mad, like all the others. BOOM! The TV screen EXPLODES in a fine shower of glass.
MUNSON: Go where?
ZARKOV: Up. Up and at him. Stunned, MUNSON turns his head and glances at something big and MIRROR BRIGHT gleaming behind foliage in center of tower.
MUNSON: You're crazy! Perfectly calm except for the maniacal glint in his eyes, ZARKOV pulls out a revolver and points it at MUNSON.
ZARKOV: I can't handle the capsule alone get your toothbrush.
PILOT: What's ,e word from Westchester Approach, Bill?
PILOT: On the left, about six o'clock The racing stream of clouds is parting open like in some surreal painting. From the cortex LASER-like bolts of RED LIGHTNING shoot out. Like a missile, one zaps right over the plane's nose with a horrible crackling NOISE.
DALE: Can you fly it?
FLASH: I can fly all right I've had a couple of lessons! just don't if I can land!
DALE: Oh boy! Ever hear about the man who fell ninety stories from a window and didn't break a bone?
FLASH: No but I'd sure like to! How'd The man fall ninety stories didn't break a bone?
DALE: The window was ninety-one stories SHOOTING FORWARD - THROUGH THE BROKEN WINDSHIELD The Earth is approaching fast, wheeling and tilting. We get a glimpse of a strange greenhouse structure at the end of a flat area. Another barrage of crackling RED LIGHTNING BOLTS shoot all around the plane but just miss it.
FLASH: Brace yourself I'm aiming at that field up ahead!
ZARKOV'S VOICE: I see you, Munson! Come out or I INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY ( MUNSON, ZARKOV ) ZARKOV is on the lower stairs of the tower, aiming his revolver. MUNSON emerges from some dry brown bush where he was hiding.
MUNSON: So what's it matter if I'm shot or go up in that thing? I'm a goner either way, right?
ZARKOV: Of course I admit that! But this way you'll be giving your life for a chance of saving Earth! Haven't you any spirit at all??
MUNSON: Goodbye, Doctor they were all right about you. Have a nice trip. MUNSON starts walking away, toward the door at the end of the long side wing.
ZARKOV: I tell you I can't take it off alone! If you won't come, who will I find? If you woo't come, who will I find: MUNSON ignores him totally, keeps walking away. ZARKOV lifts his revolver and draws a bead on the man's back. Just as he is about to shoot, he reacts to something outside.
FLASH: Dale! Are you all right?
DALE: I'm terrific.
FLASH: Come on let's get out before she FLASH helps her from the wrecked seat, wheels and kicks out the emergency exit in the cockpit area.
FLASH: Hello. i'm Flash Gordon, this is Miss Dale Arden
ZARKOV: ( MEANS IT )
FLASH: This crazy storm knocked us down could we use a phone?
ZARKOV: Certainly. Just follow me up those Some weather huh?
FLASH: Some weather huh?
ZARKOV: It will get worse. ZARKOV turns and smiles at them again as they start up the tower stairs. SUddenly DALE stops short, staring at ZARKOV with a funny expression.
DALE: You're Dr. Hans Zarkov! ZARKOV hesitates just an instant, the nods.
ZARKOV: How did you know?
DALE: I saw you in PEOPLE mag. After you left NASA, remember? It said you were utterly - DALE breaks off, almost biting her tongue.
ZARKOV: Insane? Off my rocker?
DALE: I forget what it said:
FLASH: Well, all right but it seems to me we ought to Now it's FLASH'S turn to break off. ZARKOV is pointing a gun at him.
ZARKOV: Up the stairs to the tower! Ahead of me quick! ( as they gape at him,
FROZEN ): Quick I said: We haven't much time Earth is being attacked! there's only one slim chance of saving it!
FLASH: Mister, you are insane! HOWL of ether-wind increases. Storm of RED LASER BOLTS. Glass showers them as parts of the green house EXPLODE and dry foliage bursts into FLAME.
ZARKOV: Up the stairs RUN! ZARKOV jabs the revolver into DALE'S back. RED BOLTS zap around. FLASH whispers to her as they start running up ahead of ZARKOV.
FLASH: Go with the flow wait for a chance! Below them, bottom of staircase disintergrates in a RED FLASH.
ZARKOV: I need your help to take off! Get in or I shot you dead! DALE gasps and shrinks back.
FLASH: Take off for where?
ZARKOV: God only knows whatever black corner of space this is coming from wherever HE is!. we'll plunge into the devil's heart and destroy him! We'll die ourselves, of course, but our names will be honored till the end of time!
DALE: Look, Doc I don't book kamikaze tours never. FLASH is poised to jump, but ZARKOV suddenly pushes DALE off- balance, INTO the capsule. FLASH leaps after her.
ZARKOV: Sit down there! Foot on the red pedal!
DALE: Flash! Sack him!
ZARKOV,: Friendship.Built this to send to them in.Friendship.The end now.End of the world..Unless we
NOW ): ZARKOV'S eyes close. He loses consciousness.
RED MARS: A sudden gauntlet of careening ASTEROIDS, all sizes, from tiny zingers to one almighty tumbler big as AFRICA. Mammoth JUPITER with thirteen moons and its atmosphere of deadly methane clouds more than 1000 miles deep. The RED PATCH on its surface is a storm 20,000 miles across which has raged without intermission for 200 EARTH centuries. Through the RINGS OF SATURN in a dazzling LIGHTSTORM of blazing ice crystals. NEPTUNE, PLUTO, outermost URANUS. One after another the planets are left hurtling behind, wheeling in their concentric orbits, the entire SOLAR SYSTEM dwindling into nothing.
ZARKOV: By God, we did it! We made it!
FLASH: Made it where, Doctor?
ZARKOV: I don't know. Suddenly DALE gasps, reacting to something she SEES through the transparent-from-within wall. They all look around and SEE those STRANGE MEN approaching.
DALE: Don't. Suddenly I like it in here just fine
FLASH: Hello my name's Flash Gordon can you understand me?
ZARKOV: ( URGENT )
FLASH: CLACK! With lightning speed a manacle is slammed on FLASH'S wrist and he is thrown to Â·the ground as other RED MEN advance to handcuff DALE and ZARKOV.
LEADER: You are prisoners. I will take you now to Ming the Merciless, Ruler of the universe!
ARMORED MEN: ( CHORUS )
FLASH: Thanks, Doctor next time I'll call my own play.
DALE: Just do what I'm doing. Flash
FLASH: What are you doing?
DALE: Shutting my eyes dreaming I booked us to Disneyland.
ARMORED MEN: Hail, Ming! Hail, Great One Without A hundred reduplicated ECHOES of that shout ring through unseen reaches of the palace. MING bends his head slightly in acknowledgement, points idly at the ARMORED MEN at the left of the group.
ZARKOV ): As FLASH, DALE and ZARKOV are marched along by many ARMORED MEN, perspectives are bewildering, curvilinear, surfaces
ZARKOV: Fantastic into a Black Hole and out the other side to this. Who said Hans Zarkov was mad?
DALE: You're mad. Look down over a balcony from a MOVING POV. A fencing glass is in session. SIX PAIRS OF MEN go at each other with magic swords which give off pyrotechnical displays each time the blades clash. Thrust, parry, SLASH! The head of one duellist EXPLODES in a bloodless fountain of fire.
FLASH: You got us into this HOW DO WE
GET OUT?: Get out? Why? We're being taken to Ming getting at him is our only hope of saving EARTH. It's perfect!
ZARKOV: Get out? Why? We're being taken to Ming getting at him is our only hope of saving EARTH. It's perfect!
FLASH: Dr. Zarkov, I'm about to show you what it feels like to be clipped by a New York Giant
DALE: Flash, it's no use - he's too crazy!
MING: Step forward, Soldier. The designated one marches two paces forward, halts.
ARMORED MAN: Fall on your sword.
MING: Fall on your sword.
ZARKOV: You inhuman fiend!
MING: Of course I'm "inhuman"! that's a ( Dropping his voice ) Pathetic Earthlings, forever wondering if you are alone in the universe beaming you plaintive messages into to the void for anything that might hear you even hurling your bodies out into it and all without the faintest inkling of who or what is out here. If you had known anything anything at all about the true nature of the universe, you would have hidden from it, in terror! There is a low throaty LAUGH from the shadows. FLASH and DALE turn their eyes quickly in its direction.
DALE: Watch it, fella you came with me! AURA laughs again, sidles up toward MING. We dimly SEE a couple of MUTANT CREATURES dragging away the lifeless body of the one who so vividly proved his loyalty.
MING: You know who Ming is now who are you and why do you come to Mongo?
FLASH: I'm Flash Gordon of the New York Giants this is Dale Arden Dr.Zarkov hijacked us in an effort to save
KLYTUS: Sirs, Earth is the meaningless planet you are in the process of ( pouncing on that ) In the process? You mean Earth still For the moment not for much longer.
ZARKOV: ( pouncing on that ) In the process? You mean Earth still For the moment not for much longer.
MING: For the moment not for much longer.
FLASH: But why? What in hell have we ever done to hurt you?
MING: You exist and yet you pay no homage to Ming! What greater crime can be The palace rings with an answering chorus: VOICES of all the ARMORED MEN and numerous others presently UNSEEN, including many WOMEN.
VOICES: Hail, Ming! Hail, Great One Without Come closer, Dale Arden let me see you. DALE doesn't move. MING takes a step down, narrows his eyes and gazes at her intensely. This guy's personal magnetism is enormous. As if irresistibly drawn, DALE steps forward. MING moves his hand in a gesture. A sourceless GOLDEN LIGHT bathes DALE, sensuous MUSICAL CHORDS are heard. DALE's lips open slightly, her color heightens, her rate of breathing increases. MING touches her flesh lightly. FLASH tense, ready to spring.

KLYTUS: This woman will amuse you.
ZARKOV: ( INTERESTED )
MING: He can foresee it but for a few moments only. It gives him a unique gift for survival, and treachery.
ZARKOV: Extraordinary. I'd like to study his beta factors I wager I could extend them with a course of telekinetic exercise. ( peering at KLYTUS ) Tell me when you use this fit does your temporal lobe prickle? MING flashes a glance of interest at ZARKOV, then addresses the LEADER of the ARMORED MEN.
MING: Chain this one up. Preserve him for further examination.
LEADER: Hail, Ming! ZARKOV is roughly seized. FLASH starts after them angrily as they drag the scientist away.
FLASH: Oh no you don't! We came together and we're STAYING together! Languidly, MING indicates FLASH GORDON with a pointed finger.
MING: That one is useless to us. Remove him and kill him. Shock reactions. FLASH wheels back at MING as DALE steps in front of her friend.
DALE: You dirty old bastard can kill me CLOSE ANGLE - AURA Wetting her lips, moving sinuously to WHISPER to MING:
AURA: Don't kill him yet, Father. Give him to me!
MING: ( EYEBROWS UP )
AURA: I can handle Barin.
MING: Really, Aura your appetites are too monstrous even for our family. This could cause great trouble with Barin I must forbid it. AURA touches the rime of MING'S ear with her tongue as she
AURA: But you adore me, Father you ca refuse me nothing . Yes?
WIDER SHOT: As MING steps quickly away from his super-provocative daughter and indicates DALE.
MING: Take the Earth-woman to our quarters! Bathe and annoint her for our A HOODED GUARD comes from shadow, moves towards DALE. FLASH starts around to defend her, but before he can do it DALE has made her own move. WHAM! Quick as lightning, she flattened the HOODED GUARD with a perfectly executed city- girl's kick to the balls. DALE is astonished at her own My God and I thought that book was another rip-off-
DALE: My God and I thought that book was another rip-off-
FLASH: Watch out! Behind you! Three more HOODED GUARDS are emerging from the shadows towards
QUICK ANGLES: FLASH flies at them. An elbow in the mouth disposes of one. He seizes the man's mace-like club as he falls, uses it quickly to knock cold the other two. AURA'S eyes shine at FLASH'S prowess. Fascinated, she runs her moist tongue along the cutting edge of her teeth. Panting, braced, FLASH stands in front of DALE with raised Unearthly MARTIAL MUSIC comes in a glissando from the Cavernous space above. To its tempo MING'S PERSONAL GUARDS now startsÂ· appearing. They are all a race of AMAZON WARRIORS, and the most amazing thing is that they all have the SAME FACE. From left to right, back and front, the AMAZONS advance 0n FLASH and DALE. They do not attack, merely stun ad overwhelm us with their massive, silent, answerable threat. FLASH swallows, looks this way and that, stands as if
DALE: ( low and tremulous ) What's the play, Flash?
FLASH: I can't I just can't
DALE: Can't what?
FLASH: Clobber a woman, Dale
DALE: ( OUTBURST )
DALE: The pitiful shout sends FLASH'S adrenaline rushing. With a superhuman effort, he fights free from the pile-up and dashes after DALE.
KLYTUS: She betrays you! She'll take him to So Prince Barin will kill Flash Gordon for me I don't care.
MING: So Prince Barin will kill Flash Gordon for me I don't care.
KLYTUS: Don't be too sure!
MING: I haven't taken a wife in centuries. I could bring myself to marry this Dale Arden
AURA: Take a deep breath! Grab my ankle after we hit the water I'll lead Hit what water? In answer, we instantly HEAR a titanic SPLASH.
FLASH: Hit what water? In answer, we instantly HEAR a titanic SPLASH.
AURA: Catch your breath then I'll take you up and find you a disguise.
FLASH: You're saving my life. How can I Thank you?
AURA: I'll fly you to the forest of Arboria - we'll find a way.
FLASH: Let's get one thing straight I've got to find Dale and that nut Zarkov too rescue them and try to save Earth too.
AURA: Do you realize how foolish you are to tell that to me Ming's daughter?
FLASH: I'm no good at lying.
AURA: You're funny are all Eathlings like you, Flash Gordon?
PLASH: I guess I'm about average.
AURA: You can't reach him. If a soldier spots you, it's instant death! AURA takes his hand. With one backward look toward ZARKOV who of course has not seen him, FLASH follows her.
ZARKOV: Incredible - the very core of this planet, is it not?
SOLDIER: We are but soldiers. We do not know.
MING'S VOICE: You guess well, Dr. Zarkov! ZARKOV wheels in his chains, looks up.
MING: I am forcing this plasma through the successive nuclear phases of a star - building it toward the apocalyptic moment that will end Earth's pathetic history in one flash of fire.
ZARKOV: Devil! Why don't you turn this science to peaceful use? The name Ming would be blessed instead of cursed.
MING: Bring him up to the dome, Soldiers we wish to show him wonders. At that instant a couple of worn-out SLAVES are pitched into the magma. Their dying SCREAMS are drowned by the chorus from all the minions:
EVERYONE: Hail! Ming! Hail, Great one Without INT. UPPER PALACE AREA - CORRIDOR ( AURA, FLASH ) AURA leads FLASH out through a doorway. He is now fitted out with a fairly resplendent MONGO costume: boots, cape, headdress and all. They hurry along through shadows. Suddenly FLASH seizes her by the shoulders, stops her.
FLASH: Listen, where's he got Dale? As she looks at him, she SEES a detachment of SOLDIERS marching this direction. Quickly she pulls FLASH into a niche, presses her body against his in the narrow space. WHISPERS:
AURA: Forget Dale Arden!
FLASH: I can't! I mean I hardly know her,
BUT: Forget her, Flash Gordon: I saw a look in my father's eye I think he intends to marry her.
AURA: Forget her, Flash Gordon: I saw a look in my father's eye I think he intends to marry her.
FLASH: What?? Marry her? What are you talking about??
AURA: Oh you ask so many questions.
FLASH: Can I honestly?
AURA: Trust me! AURA hauls FLASH from the niche, they hurry on a bit further. AURA stops in front of big doors, with glass windows in them.
FLASH: Here we are where?
AURA: I've dressed you as a Royal Pilot, First Class. We'll slip into my personal car and you'll fly it. FLASH takes one look into the glass, then swivels back to
AURA: Those are ROCKET SHIPS in there! I can't fly a damn rocket ship!
FLASH: Those are ROCKET SHIPS in there! I can't fly a damn rocket ship!
AURA: ( soft, teasing ) Learn from me I'll teach you so INT. MING'S DOME ( MING, ZARKOV ) Open at the top to space. But instead of our familiar pinpoint stars, here whole nebulae wheel in majesty against infinity, their innards popping with explosions as whole galaxies are born and die. ZARKOV stands before MING in chains, mesmerized by fantastic devices on every side. Most prominent is a huge transparent cube, supported in the air above a control console. MING moves to that, plays in it like an organist. we HEAR a soft intense hum, GLIMPSE great dish-like radio antennae turning on the top side of the dome.
ZARKOV: Yes, Zarkov as it was. Now as it will be, when my plasma reaches full A sudden TIDE OF FIRE sweeps the globe, Even the clouds BURN. ZARKOV gasps as MING'S fingers dance of the control keys And as it will be in yet another time, long after you have died. Earth reborn! A pleasant image, no? The fires recede. The hanging globe sparkles again with beauty just as it was except that the outlines of our continents have been subtly changed.
MING: Yes, Zarkov as it was. Now as it will be, when my plasma reaches full A sudden TIDE OF FIRE sweeps the globe, Even the clouds BURN. ZARKOV gasps as MING'S fingers dance of the control keys And as it will be in yet another time, long after you have died. Earth reborn! A pleasant image, no? The fires recede. The hanging globe sparkles again with beauty just as it was except that the outlines of our continents have been subtly changed.
ZARKOV: But that's impossible! Even your perverted genius can't create new Of course I can create life. There's nothing easier. It only requires myself and one woman.
MING: Of course I can create life. There's nothing easier. It only requires myself and one woman.
ZARKOV: ( SUDDEN UNDERSTANDING )
MING: Who else? As in that childish myth of yours Adam and Eve, wasn't it? I will breed with her and repopulate the Earth in my own image. I've already done it on over a thousand MING touches a key. The image of Earth DISAPPEARS from the cube. ZARKOV glares hatred at MING for a beat, then his eye catches something else.
ZARKOV: MING laughs, makes a sign to a SOLDIER.
MING: Return him to the dungeon.
HEDONIA: Drink this. DALE recoils, her giggling cut short.
DALE: What is it some rotten drug?
HEDONIA: It has no name. But many brave men died to bring it across space from Cythera, planet of Pleasure. It will make your hours with Ming more With a karate chop, DALE- knocks the flagon away. HEDONIA rubs her hurt wrist but does not seem angry.
DALE: Flash! Where are you?? Of course there is no answer. Sudden tears of despair spring from DALE'S eyes. She seizes the flagon and impulsively drinks it. Her expression changes.
AURA: Frigia eleventh of the moons of Mongo. It's inhabited by the Bear Men who eat their own young. FLASH shivers. Patches of frost and ice start to form on the craft's bubble.
FLASH: Some lucky people live on that one Of course - the Sand Men. Every Moon is a kingdom seperate and hostile to all the others. They have nothing in common but Ming's rule and their hatred of him.
AURA: Of course - the Sand Men. Every Moon is a kingdom seperate and hostile to all the others. They have nothing in common but Ming's rule and their hatred of him.
FLASH: Why don't they team up and fight Fight Ming the Merciless?
AURA: Fight Ming the Merciless?
FEATURE FLASH: With a sudden thoughtful look, his head working.
FLASH: Sue but that wasn't a team effort.
AURA: I don't know these words what's a FLASH just shakes his head. AURA watches him a beat more, then reaches up and pulls down a curious gadget hanging above her seat. It's a TRANSPARENT HOOD with strange fittings inside, not totally unlike a beauty-shop hairdryer.
FLASH: Because he does anything I ask. He loves me.
AURA: Because he does anything I ask. He loves me.
FLASH: You can really transfer your thoughts with that? Like I could get in touch with Dale?
AURA: If I showed you how.
FLASH: AURA just gives him a look and laughs. FLASH stares at her a moment, then suddenly MOVES HIS HANDS sharply over the control panel. The craft hurtles into a violent DIVE. AURA yells.
AURA: What are you doing? AURA drops the plastic hood, lunges to move. her own hands on the controls, but FLASH seizes her wrists.
AURA: Are you mad at Ardentia!
FLASH: That's right, Princess Â·Â·Â· and we're not pulling out until you put that gadget over my head and tune me in to Dale Arden! AURA struggles wildly, but FLASH'S grip on her wrists is like iron. The surface of Ardentia LOOMS UP , closer and INT. MING'S SERAGLIO - BATHING AREA ( DALE, FLASH'S VOICE, HEDONIA ) DALE is immersed naked in a bubbly swirling tub, a luxuriant prisoner of the FEMALES who bathe and groom her. She seems dazed by steam and by the sensuous movement of the water.
HEDONIA: Rub this on your body. It gives Ming pleasure. DALE starts to oil herself as the FEMALES exchange looks and LAUGH softly. Suddenly a FILTERED VOICE is HEARD from nowhere, though it seems very close:
FLASH'S VOICE: Dale, it's me Flash! Am I with She blinks, befuddled, pauses in her oiling of herself.
CU DALE: She blinks, befuddled, pauses in her oiling of herself.
HEDONIA: What's the matter?
DALE: I'm dreaming.
CU FLASH: with the Thought Transference gizmo down over his head, a faint BLUISH GLOW flickering within, as AURA watches him and we SEE the moon Ardentia falling behind rapidly through the glass. FLASH concentrates fiercely. We HEAR his VOICED THOUGHTS but his lips do not move.
FLASH'S VOICE: No, Dale you're not dreaming I'm Flash I'm with you and you are with me!
FLASH'S VOICE: Are you receiving my thoughts? Now we HEAR DALE'S VOICE, without her lips moving either:
DALE'S VOICE: I'm receiving something
DALE'S VOICE: Where are you Flash?
FLASH'S VOICE: Speeding for the Kingdom of Arboria to get help! I'm in a spacecraft with Aura, Ming's daughter!
DALE'S VOICE: What? That bitch? Don't trust her! She's after you!
FLASH'S VOICE: Listen, she means nothing to me not a darn thing. Where are you, Naked in a bathtub.
DALE'S VOICE: Naked in a bathtub.
FLASH'S VOICE: ( CHOKED )
DALE'S VOICE: I'm being fixed up for Ming.
DALE'S VOICE: Chained in a dungeon, I think. What'll I do, Flash?
DALE'S VOICE: FLASH'S VOICE
FLASH'S VOICE: Just fake 'em out, Dale girls know how. But don't go too far. I mean get to Zarkov and release him, I'll have help by then I'll find you. Can you do all that?
DALE'S VOICE: Sounds like fourth down and about ninety yards to go, but I'll try.
FLASH'S VOICE: Dale, you're some girl God, you really are.
DALE'S VOICE: ( SUPER-SENSUOUS )
AURA: He has a dazed dreamy look on his face. AURA slaps him out of it, points-ahead.
FLASH: Sorry. I guess landings aren't my EXT. SHUTTLE CRAFT ( AURA, FLASH ) It hangs snagged in a huge vine, like a creature caught by some monstrous boa-constrictor. This is a complete world of green, the light, the feeling of the air. Everything rings with forest SOUNDS. The very sky is shut from view by leaves and foliage. The craft's hatch opens. FLASH struggles out, gives AURA a hand up. Kneeling on the cabin, FLASH takes in this incredible vista stretching all around.
FLASH: Where's Robin Hood?
AURA: It doesn't matter. How do we get Follow me. Carefully, balancing lithely, AURA starts along the trunk of the great vine that caught them.
FLASH: It doesn't matter. How do we get Follow me. Carefully, balancing lithely, AURA starts along the trunk of the great vine that caught them.
AURA: Follow me. Carefully, balancing lithely, AURA starts along the trunk of the great vine that caught them.
SERVING GIRL: He is coming to see you now. Are you ( easy, smiling ) Do you need any more of this?
DALE: ( easy, smiling ) Do you need any more of this?
SERVING GIRL: Do you need any more of this?
DALE: No, thanks. Just turn down the light a bit, would you? I'm shy. The SERVING GIRL leans over the bed to do so. We GLIMPSE DALE'S HAND rising quickly to deliver a karate-chop.
GUARD: Serving Girl - what business have you in this dungeon? DALE quickly puts the tray down, stands and turns to the GUARD She smiles invitingly, lifts her skirt up above her The legs are long and terrific.
FLASH: Listen are you sure this Barin will help me? Gently, provocatively, AURA puts her finger on his lips to silence him.
AURA: Ssssh.. Trust me!
FLASH: It's amazing I dreamed of this tree-house when I was a kid AURA laughs softly, waves him on.
AURA: It's Barin's hunt! Watch! AURA leads him on at a run to the wide balcony above.
TREE MAN: Barin got him!
FLASH: These are the guys who are gonna help It means nothing. They only shout that because it's treason not to. They hate Ming.
AURA: It means nothing. They only shout that because it's treason not to. They hate Ming.
BARIN: I scent a Tiger Man near the lodge! Form battle lines above and below! As the TREE MEN scurry to obey, BARIN moves forward, reloading and cocking his weapon. The stricken LION MAN comes INTO VIEW. Incredibly, the glass arrow in his back has transformed him into a STATUE OF ICE. At BARIN'S footfall, he DISINTEGRATES in a tinkling fall of frozen shards. THE TIGER MAN is poised behind a tree near the lodge, panting. He is a magnificent creature, with a horn sticking out of his forehead. He tenses, HEARING the BIRDLIKE CALLS of the advancing hunters. Closer, closer.
FLASH: I know just how he feels we played the Pittsburgh Steelers last year.
BARIN: Not him! Bring him back for sport:
AURA: Go inside let me talk to Barin ( as FLASH hesitates ) Foolish Earthling - trust me!
BARIN: It's so long since I've been with you, Barin I couldn't stand it. Please don't be too angry at me for Angry at you? BARIN laughs.
AURA: It's so long since I've been with you, Barin I couldn't stand it. Please don't be too angry at me for Angry at you? BARIN laughs.
BARIN: Angry at you? BARIN laughs.
BARIN: You'll stay the night?
AURA: I've dreamed of it! His eyes alight with anticipation, BARIN steps back from her. as his MEN arrive with the netted TIGER MAN.
BARIN: Get me a sword ( turning to AURA ) This is the fiercest Tiger Man we have ever hunted. I'm going to kill him now and dedicate his blood to you, my beloved.
AURA: ( DELIGHTED )
BARIN: I know you, Aura the more a man risks, the greater your passion. If I knew a greater risk, I'd take it. AURA SMILES, turns and calls softly toward the interior.
AURA: Flash Gordon come out! FLASH steps out, halts about ten feet from BARIN. Reactions from BARIN and his TREE MEN.
FLASH: I'm from Earth, Prince Barin. My friends and I were Ming's prisoners. She kindly brought me here to enlist your help.
BARIN: What in hell? My help?
AURA: Hide him from my father don't let him wander keep him for me!

FLASH: I'm not your enemy, Prince Barin. we share a hatred of Ming
AURA: Are you so afraid of my Earthling, Barin; Won't you even give him a BARIN hesitates, provoked by that, then shouts:
BARIN: Snake keeper! Rouse your beast!
BARIN: I did him a mercy. This venom brings death only after long tortured madness. Your turn, Earthling.
CU FLASH: I think I'll pass on this one.
FLASH: I think I'll pass on this one.
INCLUDE BARIN: There are six openings to the serpent. Five are safe the sixth is death. Choose one or take your end from my sword here and now.
BARIN: There are six openings to the serpent. Five are safe the sixth is death. Choose one or take your end from my sword here and now.
FLASH: He swallows, Looks at the stump, at BARIN with his bloody sword, to the stump again, then at AURA. He crosses close and stares into her glittering eyes.
FLASH: Would you give Dale a message from me? Tell her I'm sorry how things have panned out I Loved her.
AURA: I'll do that.
FLASH: What the hell? Forget it. Sending that message by you is like sending a lettuce-leaf by a rabbit. BARIN'S sword touches FLASH'S back. He walks to the stump. Every eye is on him, every breath With a sudden quick motion, FLASH plunges his hand into a hole. He leaves it there a second, then whips it back out and wheels to BARIN.
AURA: If your love for me is great enough, Barin, surely it will protect you from the serpent no? AURA laughs softly. BARIN strides across, plunges his hand into another hole, rips it out again unscathed. He whirls to FLASH, points the sword at him.
BARIN: Go again. FLASH thrusts into a third hole, pulls out again. Turns.
FLASH: What are you waiting for? BARIN glares at him, takes a breath, jams his hand into the fourth of the six holes.
BARIN: Fooled you, didn't I? AURA laughs, turns her smile on FLASH.
AURA: It's an even chance now, Flash Gordon that's better than Daddy would have given you
FLASH: Boy. You oughta be handled with a forked stick yourself.
BARIN: If I were you, I'd choose the sword The point touches FLASH again. Just two holes left. He does a silently mouthed eeny-meeny-miney-mo between them, plunges his hand into one.
FEATURE BARIN: Picking himself up, wheeling furiously on AURA, who has been watching all this with her lips half parted, her tongue flicking teeth in supersensuous excitement.
AURA: ( TAUNTING )
BARIN: The hunt's on, my Tree Men!
TREE MEN: To the hunt with Barin!
TIGER MAN: Thank you for freeing me.
FLASH: You can speak?
TIGER MAN: For all the good it does me. SOUNDS echo: hunting horns, birdcalls of TREE MEN. They start running again.
FLASH: Have we a chance, Tiger Man?
TIGER MAN: Only if we climb out of the green light to the sky Prince Barin's Tree Men can't follow us up there!
FLASH: What do you mean?
TIGER MAN: Ming's Law outside his own kingdom, every hunter becomes the hunted! Ahead is a huge tree made for climbing: branches stick out like the rungs of some great green ladder. They leap onto the lowest. ANGLES - THE TREE - FLASH and TIGER MAN Climbing. Jack and the Beanstalk, up and up, panting, but there is never a top in sight. Suddenly the branches end.
FLASH: Damn. End of the line. TIGER MAN reacts to something off. Touches FLASH'S shoulder and points.
FLASH: Snatches the crossbow off TIGER MAN'S back, cocks it, notches it quickly with a GLASS ARROW from the quiver.
TIGER MAN: I don't know no man has ever been above the green.
TREE MAN: The sight call came from the left! TREE MA.i. The sight-call carne from the left:
BARIN: Up and across we'll cut them off! He BLOWS his horn again. The TREE MEN start moving quickly some climbing, others SWINGING laterally on vines.
TIGER MAN: What is that color above?
FLASH: Blue. We call is blue. A DOZEN TREE MEN come swinging into view on vines, land on a fat branch. The LEADER looks right in this direction, points and gives a chilling BIRDCALL. The TREE MEN unsling their crossbows, reach for GLASS ARROWS. FLASH and TIGER MAN
FLASH: Which way to the border:
TIGER MAN: Legend says Arboria ends in an ocean to the west. FLASH quickly checks his wristwatch and the angle of the shadows, starts in the direction he estimates is west.
BARIN: I saved you because your death must be mine.
FLASH: What's the point of all this killing? Why don't we team up and overthrow BARIN notches another arrow, cocks his bow, with slow pleasure raises it and aims at FLASH'S heart. Suddenly a SHADOW covers BARIN. He jerks his head up to SEE:
OTHER HAWKMEN: Hover, their wings beating the air. They dive on FLASH and TIGER MAN, lift them too.

DALE: My God your hands! Your hands are gone! It is true: ZARKOV has no hands.
ZARKOV: Not gone Just invisible. See? INVISIBLE HANDS pick up a pebble from the ground, hold it before DALE'S nose. Magically, they toss the little object back and forth from one UNSEEN HAND to the other. DALE touches one, can feel it.
DALE: Does it hurt?
ZARKOV: Not a bit. I believe Mongo's gravitational. field must have reversed the polarity of my generator so that He breaks off again. Slowly, in front of our eyes, ZARKOV'S HANDS are FADING IN, again and becoming VISIBLE. DALE whistles in amazement.
HAWKMEN: Swoop down on ZARKOV and DALE, bear them aloft as they did with FLASH AND TIGER MAN.
CU MING: In his wonderous DOME ROOM, watching something. PULL BACK. KLYTUS is beside him as usual. ANGLE to include the VIEWING SCREEN which MING is watching. On it is a directional continuation of the scene we just saw: a struggling DALE being Carrie dup into the open sky by HAWKMEN.

MING: That damned Vultan time I clipped his wings once and for all. We could put those insolent Hawkmen of his to work in the plasma cavern
KLYTUS: Dale Arden and Flash Gordon? Will I send out the Imperial Fleet to bring them back?
MING: We'll let Vultan tame her first I'll look pretty to Dale Arden after him. Flash Gordon is nobody. KLYTUS smiles that sinister way. MING looks at him Sire, it is not for me to tell Great, Ming that he is making mistakes.
KLYTUS: Sire, it is not for me to tell Great, Ming that he is making mistakes.
HAWKMAN: Want us to let you go, et?

VULTAN: Not in my Kingdom here you're just a stray animal to be killed for our sport!
BARIN: Will you do that, Vultan?
VULTAN: What would you do if you'd caught me in Arboria?
BARIN: Yes I would hunt you down and kill you without mercy. FLASH on the OTHER TERRACE Lifts his head groggily, reacts to something. ANGLE TO INCLUDE ZARKOV, stumbling out from an opening in his usual Hello - we do meet in the strangest Where's Dale?

DALE: Flash when I was in that tub
FLASH: Yes it was me
DALE: Did you mean it?
FLASH: Every thought, baby!
VULTAN: No. What have you to say to Vultan, Prince of the Air?
FLASH: We're all Ming's prisoners. I say let's team up and smash him.
