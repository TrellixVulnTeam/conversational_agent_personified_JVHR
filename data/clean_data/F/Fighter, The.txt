The two brothers play spar, joking, having fun. Micky throws a and Dicky play snaps his head back. Then Dicky does it to Micky.

Look at this -- He walks down the street like he's running for office, people shouting his out his name. . .most everyone knows him...and even those who don't are charmed by this toothless Pied Piper... some look confused, surprised by his comeback, some hold memorabilia from his Sugar Ray Leonard fight to sign.

DICKY: Ray Ray! Smile, you're gonna be in my movie! HBO's makin' a fuckin' movie about me! And my brothah's gonna win next week!

Everybody shouting out Dicky's name, "Dicky!" "Dicky!" "Dicky!" Some calling "Micky!" "Micky!" "Micky!"
CUT TO:: 4 LOWELL MAN ON THE STREET INTERVIEWS. What Dicky to the city.. .What the city is all about, broken dreams, no hope. . .How Micky & Dicky are both the pride of Lowell now & forever...

GEORGE: (trying to dial pay phone) Shut up, Tah. Alice and everyone laughs. George reading the roofing invoice, holding the pay phone, and gives them all the finger. Short & fat.
ALICE: That's not helpin', George.
GEORGE: You can't beat that ass, come on. George pats his son's shoulder as he stands behind Micky at the bar, both looking at Charlene. Awkward.

MICKY: Maybe I had a few -- tough fights, but that's not who I am. [she stares at him, gauging him]. Next's gonna show who I am.
DRUNK GUY: (shouts from behind Micky) He's gonna lose again! [Micky looks away, pissed, like he's gonna leave]. Scotch & soda one for me and one for Charlene, move that sugar ass and get the drinks! Micky suddenly slaps the guy fast twice with one hand, the guy kinda falls to the bar.
MICKY: Be nice! Be respectful. Don't disrespect her. Charlene watches, slightly turned on.
DICKY: (jumps in front of Micky) Don't hurt ya hands, we got a fight next week! (turns to the drunk) - What you say to my bruthah? What you say to me? OTHER BARTENDER plunks down the drunk's drinks.

(MID-INTERVIEW): Dicky's six years older than me. (pause) I used to carry his bags (pause) to his workouts, some of his fights. He's a born fighter, very natural talent. I always hadda work harder, and he's been my teacher. He's -- ya know - [real love] Dicky, nobody talks like him, moves like him, he fought Sugar Ray Leonard, ten rounds, he's the hero of Lowell. Everybody knows Dicky.
HBO PRODUCER: He's s'pposed to be trainin' you right now, right? Is he still coming or did we mix this up?
(OS): He'll be here -- should be --
MICKY: He kinda goes on his own schedule sometimes. He'll be here. --
(OS): You know where he is -- They turn and look: MICKEY O'KEEFE, 50, COP IN UNIFORM, walks up to the ring. Sisters react with bit of surprise, drama.

She stops when she sees the camera guys look up, unprepared.
ALICE: What's he doin'? Where's Dicky?
MICKY: Look at Alice! All dressed up for the movie!
ALICE: Outta the ring, O'Keefe, you can't do what my Dicky does!
MICKEY O'KEEFE: Your Dicky ain't here, Alice.

(CC)NTTNTTFD ): The Fighter 8/28/09 GREEN DRAFT 11.
ALICE: (to the crew, laughing) Oh, Micky. Micky's a clown. Dicky went to the store for me.
MICKY: Yeah. He'll be here.
ALICE: Get outta the ring, O'Keefe, Dicky's the numbah one trainah, should be that way in the movie.
MICKEY O'KEEFE: Jesus, I come by to help! I gotta go back to work anyhow, it ain't fair to Micky. He needs to be trainin'. He's not bein' handled right.
ALICE: (waves off HBO producer) Don't -- he's not part of this, forget him. He's numbah two man
ALICE: You need me walkin' in again? (turns back to the door) - I wasn't ready last night, but I'm ready today.
(LAUGHING): She's all dressed up! Look at her!
MICKY: Alice is dressed up. Producer nods for cameraman to turn to door. ALICE RE-ENTERS. Alice turns to an old framed BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPH on the wall ...A row of 14 year old boys posed in fighter's robes and gloves.
ALICE: That's the Golden Gloves, before that the Silvah Mittens, Micky did that too. Micky used to follow his big brothah everywhere, Dicky taught ya everything, right, honey?

MICKY: Tell 'im about Sugar Ray, Ma. Dicky knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard.
(NODS): In '78 -- we got the offah to fight Sugah Ray Leonahd.
MICKY: He just won the Gold Medal at the Olympics, Sugar Ray. He was the, ya know, the big new welter weight at that time.
ALICE: And Dicky was just a kid from Lowell.
MICKY: Dicky was undefeated!
ALICE: Dicky had never been knocked down in his professional career, neither had Sugar Ray. They were both 21- yeahs-old.
MICKY: It was Dicky's first ten roundah.
(PAUSES): I know ya could question the judgement, first ten roundah against Sugar Ray Leonard, right? But as his managah, how could I not take a Sugah Ray? Do you see what I'm saying? It was the biggest thing that evah happened to Lowell.
(MNTTNTTFD ): The Fighter 8/28/09 GREEN DRAFT 12A.
MICKY: It was huge. People still talk about it to this day. It was a great fight.
ALICE: ( 15 years earlier, already
HALF-IN-THE-BAG): Tonight my son is gonna surprise everybody and beat Sugar Ray Leonard. Believe it, I know it. Micky and Sugar Ray are described over HBO clips.
ALICE: It's true! Sugar Ray had a hard time hitting Dickie, didn't really knock him down, but Dicky knocked Ray down! I wore a new white dress. This fight was gonna change our lives forevah, and it did. BACK TO VIDEOTAPE, 2ND ROUND, Dicky, 21, bobbing moving versus Sugar Ray, 21. Hear Don Dunphy & Larry Merchant, "Ecklund is fast, Larry. If his goal is to frustrate Leonard, he's doing it. Leonard still hasn't solved his speed, still hasn't been able to find him, I think in his own cute way Ecklund is making Leonard be the aggressor.."
(CONTTNTTFM: The Fighter 8/28/09 GREEN DRAFT 13.
7 CONTINUED: (8) 7: BACK TO THE TAPE, Sugar Ray seems to either punch or pull Dicky to the mat. "Ecklund smiling again, Ecklund is down! Let's see if they call that a knock down." Dicky pops right back up and they go to separate corners. "Let's see if they call that a knock down. Nope, not a knockdown. And the bell rings." "I didn't think that was a knockdown, Don." "I didn't think so either Larry, he was wrestled down. Not a knockdown."
DICKY: (shakes his head, holding crack smoke in) Wasn't a knockdown. Dicky kneeling smoking a crack pipe. He exhales crack smoke as he pops back to his feet where he bounces on his toes like a fighter opposite GARY "BOOBOO" GIUFFRIDA, 40, a goofy looking chubby crackhead, rotting teeth, trucker's hat; WOLFIE, long sideburns, sunken eyes, 35. Dicky inhales again from pipe, a refashioned plastic soda bottle, lit with a Bic lighter. He starts sparring BooBoo. SINGLE ON Dicky OVER BOOBOO'S SHOULDER, actual audio in his head from the fight: "Ecklund has a bit of a reputation for being a fast-liver, Don." "A what?" "A fast-liver. And they think, at least Angelo said he thought that's what has held him back. But of course with an opportunity like this perhaps he's slowed down his living a little bit."
DICKY: (holding white dog) BooBoo put ya hands up, stand like Sugah Ray I gotta get ready for my movie!
BOOBOO: Why they doin' a fuckin' movie on you?

DICKY: (OS over the above) -all the mistakes and the regrets of the past melt away, you feel so much lightah like when you were young and everything's in front of you.
