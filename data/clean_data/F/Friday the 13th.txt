BARRY: I meant everything.
BARRY: ( continuing ) You know what I said, though.
CLAUDETTE: I can't, Barry.
BARRY: I care very much.
CLAUDETTE: Does Chloe kiss as good as I do?
BARRY: I wouldn't know.
CLAUDETTE: Oh, you.
BARRY: Somebody'll see.
CLAUDETTE: Somebody'll see.
BARRY: No, they won't.
CLAUDETTE: ( in a thick whisper ) Somebody's there, Barry.
BARRY: Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of Let's go back, Barry.
CLAUDETTE: Let's go back, Barry.
BARRY: I need you so much, Claudette.

OIL MAN: Okay, Annie. Let's go.
TRUDY: I wouldn't send my kids to that camp for all the tea in China.
SALESMAN: ( kidding ) I thought you hated your kids.
OIL MAN: All the girls up there gonna look as good as you?
ANNIE: I don't know.

ANNIE: Camp Crystal Lake?
OIL MAN: Something always happens up there.
OIL MAN: Don't let the spooks getcha, Annie. ANNIE smiles.
ANNIE: No sweat. Thanks a lot for the lift.
ANNIE: Hiya! I'm headed for Camp Crystal Lake. Can you help me out?
ANNIE: I can't remember being this excited about anything. I want to be a teacher when I finish at Southern State. I guess I've always wanted to work with children. I hate it when people call 'em kids. Sounds like little goats.
ANNIE: ( continuing ) The job market for teachers is supposed to be the pits these days, but I don't care. When you have a dream as long as I have, you'll do anything.
ANNIE: ( continuing ) Wasn't that Camp Crystal Lake? Just back there?
ANNIE: ( frightened, confused ) I think we better stop. Please stop. Please! Stop!
ANNIE: ( continuing )
MARCIE: Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.
NED: There you are dead wrong.
JACK: Sometimes I only think about kissing MARCIE finds a sore spot on JACK's back.
NED: Sometimes I only think about kissing MARCIE finds a sore spot on JACK's back.
JACK: I was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at Camp Crystal Lake. Besides yourself.
NED: I was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at Camp Crystal Lake. Besides yourself.
MARCIE: You are a true pierce of work, Ned.
MARCIE: ( continuing ) How about our last jay?
JACK: Good call.
NED: What about the dope paragraph in Mr. Christy's letter?
JACK: Quote: Controlled substances are expressly forbidden. Possession or use of marijuana or alcohol on campgrounds will means instant dismissal. Unquote.
MARCIE: We got two weeks before the kids even arrive. Then I'll act responsibly. Until then, hit me.
MARCIE: It's beautiful.
NED: Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't seen a coat of paint in six years.
STEVE: Wanta give me a hand here?
STEVE: ( continuing )
STEVE: ( continuing ) Wanta roll this sucker out of the way.
ALICE: Cabin B is ready.
STEVE: Push on this side. Alice, this is Jack, Marcie and Ned. Push.
STEVE: ( continuing ) That's got her. Thanks. I'm Steve Christy. Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake. You got some grubby clothes? Climb into 'em. Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out the boathouse. I want him to start with the canoes. What happened to Brenda?
ALICE: You told her to sweep the courts.
STEVE: I'd rather she painted. Let's go, folks.
NED: I thought we had two weeks.
ALICE: You can changed in three.
ALICE: Steve said for you to start on the boats.
BILL: I finished the boats.
ALICE: I'll tell him.
BILL: Alice? The others show up?
ALICE: Everybody except the girl who's supposed to handle the kitchen. Annie.
BILL: You think you're gonna last all summer?
ALICE: I'm not sure I'll last all week. I'll tell Steve.
STEVE: Shim it up just a scooch.
STEVE: ( continuing ) Perfection. Hold it.
STEVE: ( continuing ) To answer your question, my parents once owned this camp. There were some tragic accidents and they went bankrupt. I promised them I'd reopen if I could. See if it closes right now.
NED: Looks good.
STEVE: Perfection. Did you meet Brenda?
STEVE: ( continuing ) She's archery. He's rifle ranged. And I'm behind schedule. Let's go, Ned.
STEVE: Come on back here and let's above the float in.
MARCIE: What are those for? An Indian raid?
JACK: Steve's got a woodlore program. You see any life rings?
MARCIE: Here. Meet me in my cabin after taps. Okay, Camper?
JACK: For sure.
STEVE: You draw very well.
ALICE: Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
STEVE: This isn't your cup of tea, hunh?
STEVE: ( continuing ) Any particular reason?
ALICE: Just a feeling. Nothing personal.
STEVE: ( nodding ) You want to leave?
ALICE: I don't know. Probably be best for You may not care a lot about this place, Alice, but I mean to make it my whole life. It's been my whole life. Gimme a chance. Stay a week. Help get it ready. Next Friday, if you're not happy, I'll put you on the bus myself. I'll be grateful.
STEVE: You may not care a lot about this place, Alice, but I mean to make it my whole life. It's been my whole life. Gimme a chance. Stay a week. Help get it ready. Next Friday, if you're not happy, I'll put you on the bus myself. I'll be grateful.
ALICE: Next Friday.
STEVE: Thanks, Alice.
STEVE: ( continuing ) I've got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff, but I'll be back around ten. If you're still up, we can talk, okay?
ALICE: She watches him cross out of FRAME.
JACK: You want it listed separately?
STEVE: Yeah. Brenda, after lunch hit the archery range. If Annie gets here, have her start in on the kitchen. Do your best. Tomorrow we have a preliminary inspection by the state safety people. I'd like to look good.
NED: He neglected to mention this place is called "Camp Blood" downtown.
ALICE: How come?
NED: Some campers drowned. Then some counsellors got killed.
BILL: No shit. When?
NED: Late fifties sometime. They never caught the guy who did it either.
MARCIE: Neddy collects weird facts. Next he is going to tell us that there are poisonous snakes in the outhouse and green lizards in the lake.
BRENDA: You're crazy!
NED: Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?
BRENDA: ( plussed ) I don't believe you.
NED: Want to see my trick shot? It's even BRENDA still thinks he's a jerk, but he's so outrageous there's little she can do. She laughs.
BRENDA: ( still laughing ) You ever fire one of those bows again, and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.
NED: God, but I love that sexy talk.
BILL: Sorry. How you doing?
ALICE: Did you want something?
BILL: Steve said you were thinking of leaving. ALICE lugs down the box and suddenly a bunch of leather-working tools clatters down, shattering the silence. ALICE fends off the flying implements and BILL rushes to her side.
ALICE: ALICE lugs down the box and suddenly a bunch of leather-working tools clatters down, shattering the silence. ALICE fends off the flying implements and BILL rushes to her side.
ALICE: ( continuing ) Oh, my God.
BILL: You okay?
BILL: ( continuing ) You're lucky.
BILL: ( continuing ) How come you're leaving?
ALICE: It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
BILL: Maybe I can help?
ALICE: And it's this place. It makes no sense, but it spooks me.
BILL: ( smiling ) You're right. It makes no sense.
MARCIE: Help me! Save me! The frog people are after me! It's swim time at Camp Crystal Lake. Come on, Alice, I need protection!
NED: What do you want to be when you grow up?
BRENDA: Girls can't be cowboys.
MARCIE: Girls can't be cowboys.
NED: Girls can't be cowboys.
MARCIE: Okay, Fireman.
NED: Coach, athletic director somewhere.
JACK: Coach, athletic director somewhere.
BILL: Doctor. Now, if you were a flavor of ice cream, what would you be?
ALICE: Doctor. Now, if you were a flavor of ice cream, what would you be?
NED: Doctor. Now, if you were a flavor of ice cream, what would you be?
MARCIE: Rocky Road.
BRENDA: Vitamin C's supposed to neutralize the nitrites or something.
NED: There are sand sharks in this lake and they can eat the bathing suit right off ALICE laughs.
NED: ( continuing ) See? I'm getting to you. Very slowly.
ALICE: What'd you see?
BRENDA: I don't know. Marcie's got me paranoid.
BILL: It still hurts?
ALICE: I walked into it knowing I'd get hurt, but I thought I could stand anything. I just wasn't ready for that kind of pain. We were supposed to meet in L.A. When I got back there, he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife.
BILL: What'll you do when you leave here?
ALICE: I don't know.
MARCIE: Pistachio, fudge ripple, creme de menthe and I are going back to work.
BILL: Speaking as black raspberry, I guess I'm ready. Frozen yogurt? ALICE smiles at the reference.
ALICE: I'll be along.
NED: ( in a nelly voice ) Don't burn that gorgeous body, or I'll scratch your eyes out.
BRENDA: Not bad.
NED: Holy shit.
BRENDA: We wouldn't want you thinking you're the only show-off in camp, would we?
ALICE: I didn't know I was asleep.What time is it?
BILL: Almost five.
ALICE: Now I'm only eleven hours behind schedule. Steve is going to have a small cow.
BILL: You can only do what you can do.
ALICE: And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyeslike you don't care about BILL laughs at her imitation.
ALICE: ( continuing ) I'll see you later.
BILL: She stops and look down at him. He is serious and he cares. ALICE appreciates what's she's just heard. She knows that it wasn't easy for BILL to say.
ALICE: You're very nice.
BILL: Hope you will.
ALICE: ( a tight whisper ) There's a fucking snake in here.
MARCIE: Steve never mentioned serpents. Jack, would you get some paper towels?
ALICE: How the. did he get in there?
BILL: Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.
MARCIE: You okay now?
BILL: You okay now?
MARCIE: Go ahead. I walk on 'em all the time. Would you shovel Mr. Snake outta here?
JACK: BRENDA Four zip. How'd it get in the drawer?
MARCIE: How you doin'?
ALICE: Okay. Can I help?
BRENDA: It's catch as catch can. I'm making a salad. The guys are planning to cook greaseburgers for themselves.
MARCIE: There's a lot of dishes if you just want something to do.
ALICE: The way I feel, that's perfect.
JACK: It's gonna be a long summer.
NED: Wait, wait! When I was finding these goodies in the shed. I also found this letter which a camper never sent home. He takes a letter out of his breechclout. He pretends to read, when really we can see that the paper is blank.
NED: ( improvising ) Dear Mom and Dad, Camp Blood is real fine except for the strange man who flies at night and sucks our counsellor's body.
NED: ( continuing ) And, Mommy, we really love our counsellor. He says that whenever I'm scared, I can sleep in his bunk with him.
NED: ( continuing ) No wonder they lost America. How could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that? What's to eat?
BRENDA: Whatever you make yourself.
BILL: NED Too bad that Annie never Cannibals. It's old showed. She was supposed counsellor. to be a good cook.
NED: The squaws are revolting!
BILL: Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.
ALICE: Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.
JACK: Steve taught me how to use the emergency generator. The town power lines are supposed to be real shitty.
NED: God, but I love that macho talk! Emergency generators! The Indian used JACK turns to BILL.
JACK: Give me a hand?
BILL: For sure.
BILL: This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine.
JACK: Here we go.
JACK: ( yelling ) Now ya' close the switch.
JACK: I'll be okay. Holy shit.
BILL: Don't get up. Take a second.
JACK: You saved my life.
BILL: I had to.
JACK: I figured if I didn't save you. I'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite.
BILL: I figured if I didn't save you. I'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite.
JACK: Satisfied that JACK won't fall down, BILL goes to the shed and looks in.
BILL: This puddle was enough to ground you all the way to China.
JACK: Floor probably leaks. This area is full of springs.
BILL: A short somewhere.
BILL: ( continuing ) There's the problem, Jack. Wire worked itself loose.
JACK: Just in cause this bugger goes bad. I'm gonna pick up some lanterns from the equipment shack.
NED: What hath God wrought?
BRENDA: That was the telephone.
NED: Ha! You wily oriental! The phone was "Mr. Watson, come in here, I need you." "What hath God wrought" was the telegraph.
MARCIE: Last line of Gone With the Wind?
NED: Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
BRENDA: Shows how much you know. It's something about tomorrow.
ALICE: Tomorrow is another day.
BRENDA: Right! Right!
ALICE: This just plain ain't my day.
BRENDA: Wash it out real good.
BILL: Lemme see. Doesn't look too bad.
NED: Who played the role of Gorgon in Star I don't want you getting Melvin Belli. I was careless. guaranteed winner!
NED: ALICE Aaaargh! That my I was careless. guaranteed winner!
ALICE: Somebody probably dropped something too hard.
NED: Alice, you're just lucky there are no snakes in the dishwater here.
MARCIE: Soooooeeeeey, piggy, piggy.
JACK: What is it?
BILL: Is it stuck?
NED: REACTION SHOTS: as it sinks in that NED has been putting them on.
JACK: Not funny, Ned.
MARCIE: Wait'll you're really in trouble and see what happens.
NED: But it's in the brochure! "Camp Crystal Lake has a full drama program." You just saw it.
BILL: Chance to get even?
JACK: I'll spot you five points.
NED: Hey, look, I'm sorry. I'll never do it NED turns and heads for the door. ALICE comes up next to him. The OTHERS are out of earshot now. BILL and JACK play a little ping-pong. NED is a little embarrassed by his play-acting I'm sorry.
NED: ( continuing ) I'm sorry.
ALICE: Ned? We're gonna be working together for a while. You're a nice guy without all the entertainment, okay?
NED: Tell 'em I'm sorry?
ALICE: I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's. Today wiped me out. Thanks, Alice.
NED: I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's. Today wiped me out. Thanks, Alice.
ALICE: You're welcome.
MARCIE: I hope that's the last time we see the Camp Crystal Lake Drama Program.
NED: Hello? Can I help you?
JACK: You just had some lucky shots.
BILL: Where's Ned?
ALICE: He went to bed early.
MARCIE: I don't blame him.
BRENDA: He's probably setting up another one of his practical jokes.
MARCIE: Yeah, like draining the lake!
JACK: ( to MARCIE ) Hey, how about a walk by the lake?
JACK: ( continuing ) Just a walk, for Chrissakes.
MARCIE: ( kidding ) Boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy small-minded people around here. ( to JACK ) Wait a minute, I'll get my diaphragm and be right with you.
JACK: Wind's up. It's shifted a good hundred and eighty degrees.
MARCIE: Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
JACK: I love you.
MARCIE: I love you.
MARCIE: ( continuing ) What about Neddy?
JACK: I don't love Neddy.
MARCIE: He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
JACK: ( yelling ) Don't call him.
MARCIE: Don't call him.
JACK: I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
MARCIE: I guess.
JACK: Looks like a storm.
MARCIE: I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
JACK: You? The brick?
MARCIE: I've dreamed this dream. Maybe half a dozen times. There is a thunderstorm. The rain comes down like pebbles. I can hear the sound. I try to close my ears off. It doesn't work. The sounds gets louder. The rain turns to blood and the blood washes down in little rivers. And the sound stops.
JACK: It's just a dream.
MARCIE: I call it my shower dream.
JACK: This is no dream. Want to escape for a Lead the way!
MARCIE: Lead the way!
MARCIE: Are you wet?
JACK: Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.
ALICE: Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
BILL: Not if they're where I think they are.
ALICE: I'm not always this stupid.
MARCIE: Best over.
JACK: Best over.
MARCIE: Best over.
JACK: Like waves. It's never been likes waves Gotta pee. You're lying on my bladder.
MARCIE: Like waves. It's never been likes waves Gotta pee. You're lying on my bladder.
JACK: Gotta pee. You're lying on my bladder.
MARCIE: Gotta pee. You're lying on my bladder.
MARCIE: ( dressing ) I know this ain't very romantic, but what can I say? I don't want to explode.
MARCIE: ( reading ) "Forty yards to the outhouse by Willie Makit." "The Yellow Stream by I.P. Daley." Not the most original stuff,
MARCIE: ( continuing )
MARCIE: The screen door to the shower room is swinging open and shut.
MARCIE: ( continuing ) Jack? Neddy? Don't put me on.
MARCIE: ( continuing ) Allee allee infree!
MARCIE: ( continuing ) Must be my imagination.
SANDY: Anything else you want?
STEVE: No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
SANDY: You can't go back there tonight. Not in that stuff. 'Less you wanta get drownded.
STEVE: ( drinking quickly ) I got to.
SANDY: SANDY likes STEVE and enjoys flirting with him.
STEVE: I have six new counsellor up there. They're all babes in the woods in every sense of the word.
SANDY: They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
SANDY: One night on the town.
STEVE: I mean.
SANDY: .I know what you mean. Two and a quarter. Plus fifteen percent tip to make up for me spending the night alone.
SANDY: ( continuing ) You got a roof for that Jeep?
STEVE: Yeah. I got it on before this all started.
SANDY: That's thirty percent.
STEVE: For two lonely nights.
SANDY: Drive careful and don't drownd your dumb STEVE smiles and leaves. She watches, then counts her changes and sticks it her pocket with the rest of her tips for the day.
BRENDA: You think they fell asleep?
BILL: Anything's possible. My parents taught me to leave sleeping lovers alone.
ALICE: It wouldn't matter except Steve should be getting back pretty soon. It wouldn't look so great if he fell over them.
BILL: Good point.
ALICE: Well, it hasn't been that long.
BRENDA: Long enough for me.
ALICE: I think we should go wake them up. Just in case.
BRENDA: Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
ALICE: I guess.
BILL: Got to it just in time. The generator was running on fumes. I filled it up. That should keep it humming until Steve gets back.
BRENDA: Good night, Alice.
ALICE: Good night, Brenda.
BILL: Help you clean up?
ALICE: She walks with him as he carries the tray of empty coffee cups into the kitchen.
TIERNEY: I told you not to buy that hunk of junk!
STEVE: I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counsellors to drive me back tomorrow morning.
TIERNEY: Why not?
TIERNEY: ( continuing ) "To serve and protect" don't mean to
BRENDA: That could drive a person bug-city.
BRENDA: Neddy? Cut the screwing around, Neddy!
BRENDA: ( continuing ) This isn't even half funny.
BRENDA: Christ, what a jerk.
BRENDA: ( continuing ) Great. Now what?
BRENDA: ( continuing ) Looks like I turn in early.
ALICE: I don't here it anymore.
BILL: Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
ALICE: It sounded like Brenda.
BILL: I'll go take a look.
ALICE: Did somebody leave the lights on at the softball field?
BILL: They're off now.
ALICE: They're off now.
BILL: I'll go check on Brenda.
ALICE: ALICE turns. BILL is halfway out the door.
ALICE: ( continuing ) I'll go with you.
BILL: If it'll make you feel better.
TIERNEY: Bad enough we got a full moon; it's Friday the 13th. They keep statistics. We get more accidents, more robberies, more rapes, more homicides, more of everything when there's a full moon. It affects people. Makes 'em nuts.
STEVE: You've made a science out of coincidence.
TIERNEY: This is Tierney.
TIERNEY: Roger. Acknowledge receipt. Estimate arrival time fifteen minutes. How copy?
TIERNEY: Have to drop you here, Steve.
STEVE: STEVE gets out quickly.
STEVE: ( continuing ) Good luck.
TIERNEY: Another coincidence.
STEVE: CUT TO:
ALICE: Brenda? Brenda? You there?
ALICE: BILL crosses over to ALICE. They are both looking down, past the CAMERA LENS. ANOTHER ANGLE: WE SEE WHAT THEY SEE: the bloody hatchet left on Brenda's pillow.
ALICE: ( continuing ) What the fuck is going on here?
BILL: Hey, guys!
ALICE: Hey, guys!
BILL: Hey, guys!
ALICE: Marcie? Brenda? Jack?
ALICE: ( continuing ) I think we should call the police, Bill.
BILL: They exit. There is a beat. and then a slickered shape passes between us and the night sky light which comes through the windows. The shape is dragging something.
BILL: Sucker's locked. Who's got the key?
BILL: ( continuing ) It's dead. Try the pay phone.
ALICE: Do you have a dime? A quarter?
BILL: No. There must be some in the desk They fumble through the desk to find some change. BILL finds some in the postage drawer. He then crosses over to a pay phone mounted on the wall. The CAMERA moves to the cornice of the building where the phone line exits. It follows the link up the side of the cabin to the junction where the power and phone lines come in from the pole. Here we see a dangling phone cable which has been recently cut. OVER, we hear the sound of a quarter dropping in the dead Hello? Hello? This damn thing's dead, BILL and ALICE comes out into the rain, heading for the camper van. They hop in.
ALICE: What's the matter with it?
BILL: Wet. I don't know.
ALICE: Why don't we run? Just run now?
BILL: It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.
BILL: ( continuing ) Don't worry. There is probably some really stupid explanation for all this. When the sun comes up tomorrow, you'll ( pause )
STEVE: Hi. What are you doing out in this mess?
BILL: Oh, shit..
ALICE: She gets her bearings and looks around. Stands up. She looks at the bulb overhead. Pulls its string. No light.
ALICE: ( continuing ) The generator.
ALICE: Bill? Bill?
ALICE: CUT TO:
ALICE: She closes the door, and turns in the direction of the body.
ALICE: ( continuing ) Help! Help!
ALICE: Jack! Marcie! Help me!
ALICE: The knife!
MRS. VOORHEES: There now, my dear. Please. I can't help you if you can't talk to me. There, there now.
ALICE: He's dead. She's dead. all dead. Please save me. oh. poor Bill. Oh my God, oh my God. oh God.
MRS. VOORHEES: It will be all right. I'll take care of Jack? Marcie? Ned?
ALICE: Jack? Marcie? Ned?
MRS. VOORHEES: It's just this place. The storm. That's why you're all upset.
ALICE: No, no, they're all dead.
MRS. VOORHEES: I'll go look.
ALICE: They'll kill you! Don't leave me!
MRS. VOORHEES: I'm not afraid.
ALICE: All dead? Neddy? Oh, Marcie. ALICE stands close to the fireplace.
MRS. VOORHEES: Oh, my lord.
MRS. VOORHEES: ( continuing ) So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?
ALICE: BillBillBill is out there.
MRS. VOORHEES: We shall go straight to the police.
ALICE: The killer is still out there.
MRS. VOORHEES: I will protect you.
MRS. VOORHEES: ( continuing ) Oh, this place. It should never have been a camp. Not for children. They had so much trouble here.
MRS. VOORHEES: ( continuing ) Camp Blood.
MRS. VOORHEES: ( continuing ) You know a boy drowned the year before those two others were killed? An accident? It was inadequate supervision. The counsellors were not paying enough attention. They were making love when that boy drowned.
MRS. VOORHEES: ( continuing ) We should go now.
ALICE: Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
MRS. VOORHEES: No. That won't be necessary.
ALICE: I don't understand.
MRS. VOORHEES: ( cocking her hand to listen ) I am, Jason. I am.
ALICE: ( a little confused ) Why shouldn't we wait for Mr. Christy?
MRS. VOORHEES: It was my son they killed. They said he drowned, but I know it was inadequate ALICE starts to become increasingly anxious. She can't see the knife rise behind her.
ALICE: Mr. Christy will be back soon.
MRS. VOORHEES: No, he won't. I killed him as well..
MRS. VOORHEES: ( continuing ) I couldn't let them start this camp again, could I?
ALICE: I won't let you!
ALICE: ( continuing ) No! No! No!
MRS. VOORHEES: ( in her own voice ) I can't let them kill any more children. Come out now.
ALICE: Where are the goddamned bullets?
ALICE: ALICE folds her hands at the side of her face.
ALICE: Help me.
