LA VALLE: There are four auto graveyards like this one in the other boroughs, handling about a thousand vehicles a month. Those that aren't claimed are auctioned here once a month.
MARIE: Just for mistakes of parking?
LA VALLE: No. Many are involved in crimes and confiscated. or just abandoned. This is, as you know, your prime source of scrap metal, M. Charnier.
MARIE: ( off camera ) Darling, may I have this one?
MARIE: It looks so lonesome here.
CHARNIER: It would look even more lonesome in our garage.

MARIE: Alain is the only man I know who can become as enthusiastic about a bridge as he can about a woman.
CHARNIER: Not any woman, Marie. Just one.
LA VALLE: I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France.

BAD EDDIE: Best I ever seen was The Rock. He was the calmest and the meanest. Guys like Sugar'd be pukin' before a fight. Jake LaMotta'd be pukin'. Marciano was calm like he was goin' to church. What about the night he fought LaStarza? He hit him so hard he broke the blood vessels in LaStarza's arms. He was the strongest meanest bastard ever lived.

DOYLE: ( rattling pans, looking around ) Where the hell is it?
MUTCHIE: Where the hell do you think it is, potato head?
MUTCHIE: No wonder there's so many Mafia around. Ya couldn't find a Puerto Rican in Spanish Harlem.

DOYLE: Morning. Sometime.
MUTCHIE: Whyn't ya stretch out on the pool table for a couple hours. The kid comes in at six will wake ya. A couple eggs and a beer is cheaper than keepin' a dog around the joint.

SIMONSON: You know Doyle, don't you Bill?
MULDERIG: ( rises ) Sure, I know Popeye. The Master of undercover, whose brilliant idea of disguise is to limp into a room on his left foot and limp out on his right. Whose brilliant hunches cost the death of a good officer
RUSSO: If that's how you're coming in, why not stay home and save us all a lot of grief.

DOYLE: What do we need those pricks for?
RUSSO: Because by actual count our bureau has exactly nine hundred eighteen dollars and fifty-four cents to make buys and Mulderig's Feds can get all of Uncle Sam's money he wants by just asking.
DOYLE: Throw 'em in the bathroom, will you? How good are the warrants?
RUSSO: ( on the move down hall, at bathroom door ) Sixty days. Here. Don't mention it.

RUSSO: Drive carefully!
MULDERIG: Strictly small potatoes.
MULDERIG: You really know how to pick 'em,
MULDERIG: Still wearing your gun on your ankle?
MULDERIG: Somebody told me the reason you did that was so's when you met a chick and rubbed against her she wouldn't know you were a cop.
MULDERIG: I said that was bullshit. It must be some kind of fast-draw gimmick or something.
RUSSO: Knock it off, Bill.

NIGHT: Long shot of the Lincoln, zooming on the glittering car. In the BG, eight youngsters are playing a game of street hockey.
DOYLE: EXT. DOYLE'S CAR - NIGHT Long view over the hood of DOYLE's car to the street. We can see the Lincoln. The lights of a car appear on the left and come down the street past the Lincoln, slowly, like a man looking for a place to park. We can make out, but just barely with the help of the street lights, four people in the car. DOYLE in close profile, the foreground, picking up a corner of the Lincoln in the background. While we are looking in silence, there is a glimmering flow in the far corner, the beginning of approaching headlights again. They grown brighter and DOYLE's foreground profile turns to watch it

DOYLE: Tumble it. One end to the other.
MECHANIC: Nobody's been under there with anything but a grease gun since if came off the line.
DOYLE: I don't buy it. The stuff is on this car.
MECHANIC: Then you find it. I can't.
LA VALLE: The car was lost sometime this evening. First they send us to Pier One then they send us I don't understand why you had it parked on the waterfront. You're staying at the Doral and you lose your car somewhere out by the Brooklyn Bridge.
DESK SERGEANT: I don't understand why you had it parked on the waterfront. You're staying at the Doral and you lose your car somewhere out by the Brooklyn Bridge.
LA VALLE: In point of fact, M. Devereaux is scouting locations for a film for French Television. He left the car to look at some point of interest.
DEVEREAUX: ( moving, excitable ) We were told by the Police Commissioner's office that the car was brought to this garage. I demand its immediate return.
DESK SERGEANT: If you'll be patient, Mr. Devereaux.
DEVEREAUX: ( moving ) I have been patient enough. There is no reason I should have to waste time with this red tape.
LA VALLE: Mr. Devereaux is an extremely important guest of this country. He is working with the absolute cooperation and participation of your government. Here are his credentials from the French Unless you wish to see this episode portrayed in his film I suggest you locate his car immediately.
MECHANIC: What are you looking for? Is it as big as an orange or an elephant's ass? I've been over every inch top to bottom. If you could give me a club to the size.
RUSSO: ( doing rough figures on a piece of scratch paper ) What was the weight of the car when you got it, Irv?
MECHANIC: ( consulting his notes ) 4,839 pounds.
RUSSO: ( consulting Lincoln Specification Book ) You're sure? ( he does quick addition ) The manufacturer's spec says it should weigh 4,719 pounds. This one's carrying roughly 120 extra pounds somewhere.
RUSSO: When it was booked in at Marseilles it weighed the same. 120 pounds overweight. Jimmy has to be right.
MECHANIC: I ripped everything out except the Rocker panels.
DEVEREAUX: What's that?
RUSSO: Got it for you, Randy it just came in from downtown. Who's This is M. Devereaux.
LA VALLE: This is M. Devereaux.
RUSSO: I'm sorry, Mr. Devereaux, but we get reports on a couple hundred vehicles a night. Sometimes it's a little tough to keep track.
DEVEREAUX: You mean the car's here now?
RUSSO: Yeah fine it's okay not even a scratch. You're all set.
RUSSO: Someone stole it right off the street, huh? You're gonna have to pay the tow away charge.
DEVEREAUX: I was told these things happen in New York but one never expects it.
RUSSO: Yeah. Well, it's in perfect shape. You must lead a charming life.
CHARNIER: Medium close shot of DEVEREAUX turning to face CHARNIER, who has been waiting for him.
