GRANDMA BONNIE: If somebody told me say twenty years ago, that I would live to see it happen, I'd have laughed in their face.
OSCAR: If somebody would have told me that two years ago I would have laughed in their face.
DARYL: And here we are. 2008 and its
CEEPHUS: But I think it's a sign of the times. The country is in bad enough shape for them to hand it over to a black guy. Look, if Bush hadn't have messed the country up so bad. Would he have even had a shot?
DARYL: I think he still would have had a But would he have won though?
CEEPHUS: But would he have won though?
WANDA: Well, I'm happy the did win. If the country really is as messed up as you say, I think he's our best chance of fixing it.
SOPHINA: I keep thinking about how much it means for T.
OSCAR: When I was coming up, Teachers used to love to tell me, "You can be the President of the United States."
WANDA: You'd make a great politician. You can talk your way out of anything.
OSCAR: But I'll never forget, in my fourth grade classroom we had this poster. It had all 40 some odd presidents on that thang. And I looked at all they faces. And it was all white dudes. At that point, I realized my teachers was lying to me. A part of me aint believed what no teacher has said to me since.
DARYL: Now there will be a black face on those posters.
GRANDMA BONNIE: Well let's let him get in there I know, I still feel like it's just too good to be true.
WANDA: I know, I still feel like it's just too good to be true.
CEEPHUS: What's so good about it?
DARYL: A black man, one of us has been elected president, fair and square.
CEEPHUS: But he's not one of us. He wasn't affected by slavery.
