FOXCATCHER: Written by
MARK: Why do I do it? Why do I push myself to my limits - of pain, of exhaustion - every day of my life? Why do I wake up every morning and make the commitment? Why do I do The students are open-mouthed - they have no idea what to make of him. Mark's not being willfully over-the-top with these kids. This is just what's on his mind. All the time.
SCHOOL SECRETARY: Twenty. and. no one-hundreds. She tears off the check and hands it to Mark. He takes the check, holds out to her a SIGNED 8x10 PHOTO of himself with his arms raised, in a USA WRESTLING SINGLET just after winning his Olympic gold.
MARK: And this is for the trophy case.
SCHOOL SECRETARY: I'm sorry?. For what?
MARK: For the trophy case.
SCHOOL SECRETARY: It's an elementary school. As Mark holds out the photo, WE HEAR:
MARK: I'll have a # 4.
MARK: No. Can I get extra meat on that?
MARK: What are you talking about?
MARK: Where's it say that?
MARK: I always get extra meat. Every time I come here.
DAVE: Where were you today?
DAVE: How far'd you run? Ten? Mark's on the tattered couch. He shrugs, though we should see that he loves the fact that Dave is concerned about him.
MARK: Talked to some coaches. Dave comes toward Mark, handing off a water glass, dragging the folding chair over to sit across from him.
DAVE: I hope you don't have anything booked for Saturday.
MARK: I need a favor. This school called me months ago to do a gig but now I can't. Nancy's got a thing all day so I gotta watch the kids. You I'll check. He goes into the bedroom, looks at the calendar. There's NOTHING WRITTEN DOWN for any of the days.
DAVE: I need a favor. This school called me months ago to do a gig but now I can't. Nancy's got a thing all day so I gotta watch the kids. You I'll check. He goes into the bedroom, looks at the calendar. There's NOTHING WRITTEN DOWN for any of the days.
MARK: I'll check. He goes into the bedroom, looks at the calendar. There's NOTHING WRITTEN DOWN for any of the days.
DAVE: Saturday could work. He comes back in.
MARK: Saturday could work. He comes back in.
DAVE: Good. Thank you. Dave looks at the BACK OF HIS HAND, where he's written down a name and phone number in MARKER. He grabs one of Mark's VHS labels and a pen and writes the information.
MARK: Seoul's the goal.
MARK: The minute you step on the mat, you are exactly who you are. You can't hide. You can't pretend you trained harder than you did, you want it more than you do. My brother Dave and me care about this more than we care about anything. The difference between the number one guy in the world and the number four guy is paper thin. The one who wins is the one who wants it more, who's willing to sacrifice, who can take the pain. I can take the pain. My brother Dave can take the pain. Can you take the pain? Blank looks from the teenage wrestlers. Mark gestures to a table set up near the door, on which is his OPEN BRIEFCASE, with a stack of TAPES.
DAVE: You remember Fred Cole from USA The men walk up behind Dave.
FRED COLE: Hey there, Mark, how you been? Mark sort of nods, but doesn't really respond.
MARK: You been calling me and hanging up?
DAVE: ( adjusting his knee brace ) No. What do you mean? Mark doesn't answer, just stands looking at him. For several seconds, they look at each other. Then, slowly at first: They start to circle each other. We sense immediately their differences: Dave's hunched and not very muscular physique belies his quickness and enormous strength.
MARK: Sorry about your nose.
DAVE: No, you're not.
MARK: You win a gold medal for them. And still. Nothing. No respect. He reaches for the door handle.
DAVE: Hey. Gimme a hug. Dave reaches for his arm, and Mark folds automatically into his older brother, puts his head on his chest. Dave embraces him for several long moments - it's like a father and his young child. Then Dave smacks him on the back of the neck.
BRANDON: Mr. Schultz, I'm Brandon. Welcome to Philadelphia.
BRANDON: Feel free to look around the library. Mr. du Pont will be up Shuts the door behind him. Mark's never been in a room like this - oil paintings of du Pont ancestors; foxhounds, horses, hunts. Leather-bound books share space with framed OLD STAMPS and antique ( and not so antique ) PISTOLS. Framed PHOTOS of the same man ( JOHN DU PONT - 50, thin, beak-nosed, blond-grey hair ) with Presidents Ford, Nixon, Reagan. Henry Kissinger. Mark's standing, gazing at the photos, when the door opens, revealing JOHN DU PONT, a police-issue HOLSTER dangling from one hand. He stops and breathlessly regards Mark.
DU PONT: You're actually here.
MARK: Oh. Yes, sir.
DU PONT: In my study.
MARK: ( no idea what to say ) They said it was the library.
DU PONT: It is. Du Pont puts the holster onto a chair. Holds out his hand.
MARK: Mark Sch
DU PONT: - I know who you are - I've watched your Olympic victory enough times to know exactly who you are, every inch of you. Please, put your bag down, make yourself comfortable, sit, make yourself at home - ( You quickly realize that du Pont can be voluble and charming, but the more time you spend with him, the more you see what an effort this is for him - how essentially uncomfortable he is in his own skin.. Also, he just might have snorted a tiny bit of coke before he came in. )
MARK: Thank you, sir. I'm proud of that You should be. I'm proud of that day. I'm proud of you on that day. Your parents must be enormously ( after a moment ) To be perfectly honest, we don't often talk. Du Pont nods, hoping Mark might say more. When he doesn't -
DU PONT: You should be. I'm proud of that day. I'm proud of you on that day. Your parents must be enormously ( after a moment ) To be perfectly honest, we don't often talk. Du Pont nods, hoping Mark might say more. When he doesn't -
MARK: ( after a moment ) To be perfectly honest, we don't often talk. Du Pont nods, hoping Mark might say more. When he doesn't -
DU PONT: I want to tell you how much I appreciate your coming here. I know it cuts into your training. I imagine that's every day for you?
MARK: Yes sir, it is.
DU PONT: Strength training in the morning? Upper body regimen - muscle tone - building up the muscle tone - across the upper body. In the Oh. Well. I take the mornings on my own - as you said, strength training, endurance - then I meet up with my brother - you know Dave Schultz - ?
MARK: Oh. Well. I take the mornings on my own - as you said, strength training, endurance - then I meet up with my brother - you know Dave Schultz - ?
DU PONT: Of course, of course, yes, I know him. I mean, not personally, but yes, of course, I do know him.
MARK: - I meet up with him at the U-W gym, we work out whatever free time we can grab between team practice.
DU PONT: University of Wisconsin.
MARK: Yes sir.
DU PONT: Where you both coach. Mark NODS vaguely.
MARK: Pretty much. A moment as du Pont watches Mark.
DU PONT: I'd like to see you win this upcoming tournament -
MARK: - Thank you -
DU PONT: - I'd like to help you win this upcoming tournament. It's a big one, yes?
MARK: It's the world championship.
DU PONT: Why do you do it, Mark? Mark just looks at him, unsure what he's being asked.
MARK: ( simply no other reason ) I want to be the best in the world.
DU PONT: I want you to be the best in the world. I want this country to be the best in the world.
MARK: I started kind of late - high school sophomore. Du Pont waits, listening.
DU PONT: You won that match. Not him.
DU PONT: The U.S. Olympic Committee refuses to recognize that training for international competition is a full time job. Why is that? Why is that? ( looks at Mark ) I want you all to have a home.
DU PONT: The sacrifices of the troops that first long winter remind me of what you athletes go through. Silence as they look out over the national park.
DAVE: You ready? Beat. The boy nods. They climb higher.
MARK: 25 thousand a year. He said name your price and I said the highest price that came into my head. We'd get to hand-pick our own team, wrestlers we want to work with -
DAVE: Who you gonna train with?
MARK: No - I mean. when I say we, I mean - you and me. could choose a team. Together.
DAVE: What does du Pont get out of it?
MARK: As soon as you meet him you'll understand. He sees what we're after. He cares about America - old family, basically paid for the Revolutionary War - he gets it. He wants to help us win, help restore our pride.
DAVE: My pride is fine.
MARK: No, not.. This country's pride. Dave just looks at him, silent.
NANCY: - What're you guys talking about?
MARK: I'm speaking to my brother, that okay with you? Nancy and Dave share a glance. Then Nancy turns to walk away.
NANCY: Always good to see you, Mark. ( as she walks away ) Please, eat our food, shit on our lawn. Enjoy yourself. The brothers are silent for a long moment until she's gone.
MARK: Why does she. He trails off. Then, a bit desperate -
DAVE: I got a good thing going here. I got a contract. Nancy's happy, Alex likes his school. The reality starts to hit Mark that he may be doing this alone, without his older brother. He's shell-shocked.
MARK: The Worlds are sixty days away.
DAVE: Tell me your plan. Who you gonna train with?
MARK: ( LOST )
DAVE: Do what? The answer is "everything" but Mark just shakes his head.
MARK: Does it?
DAVE: I think you could make something of Do you?
MARK: Do you?
DAVE: Thank you. Dave steps forward and holds out his arms -
MARK: Hi. I'm Mark Schultz. Silence. That means nothing to her.
UNIFORMED MAID: Is Mr. du Pont expecting you?
MARK: Yeah. Well - not today exactly, but, yes. This week. Sometime.
UNIFORMED MAID: Just a moment, please.
MARK: In the meantime can I use the - She SHUTS the door, leaving him outside. He turns and looks out over the VAST LAWN of the estate. Far off, it's being mowed by a gardener.
UNIFORMED MAID: ( opening the door ) INT. BIG HOUSE/FOXCATCHER - CONTINUOUS They walk just a few feet and she gestures toward a door.
MARK: ( CONFUSED )
UNIFORMED MAID: The washroom.
UNIFORMED MAID: Mr. Beck will see you now. Mark doesn't know who Mr. Beck is.
STAN BECK: Come in, sit down.
MARK: STAN BECK
STAN BECK: Thank you, Rosie.
UNIFORMED MAID: You're welcome, Mr. Beck. She exits, closing the door behind her.
STAN BECK: Okay. Okay. So. Mark Schultz, ( opens a folder, writing )
MARK: STAN BECK
STAN BECK: ( opens a folder, writing )
MARK: That's right.
STAN BECK: . M-A-R-K? Mark just looks at him. Beat. Then he nods.
MARK: Sounds okay.
STAN BECK: Let's talk about what you're doing here. I'd like to make sure we all understand each other. Does that sound like a good policy to you?
MARK: That could be a good policy.
STAN BECK: Good. I think so, too. First thing I can tell you is that Mr. du Pont is very happy he can help you with your goals. But I want to make sure you're aware of what's expected. It's not a free ride. In exchange for the guest house, the more than substantial salary, the privilege of training at Foxcatcher Farms, Mr. du Pont expects results. I'm sure you can appreciate that.
MARK: STAN BECK
STAN BECK: I'm sure you can appreciate that.
MARK: Of course.
STAN BECK: That goes for every wrestler.
MARK: I've actually got suggestions for about half the roster. He pulls a creased, folded piece of paper from his pocket.
STAN BECK: What about the other half?
MARK: ( BEAT )
STAN BECK: I'll take a look at that when you've finished. All right. Now. Stan takes out a form, writes on it as Mark puts away list.
MARK: STAN BECK
STAN BECK: Oklahoma University.
MARK: Oklahoma University.
STAN BECK: STAN BECK
MARK: STAN BECK
STAN BECK: You graduated?
MARK: STAN BECK
STAN BECK: Do you own any property?
MARK: STAN BECK
STAN BECK: Are your parents still married?
MARK: ( BEAT ) STAN BECK STAN BECK
STAN BECK: How old were you when they Have you ever been accused of a The DOOR OPENS and John du Pont pokes his head in. Mark STANDS, relieved to see him finally
MARK: STAN BECK
STAN BECK: Have you ever been accused of a The DOOR OPENS and John du Pont pokes his head in. Mark STANDS, relieved to see him finally
MARK: The DOOR OPENS and John du Pont pokes his head in. Mark STANDS, relieved to see him finally
DU PONT: Ah. Hello. You've arrived.
MARK: Yes sir, I drove straight down. It's a little odd that du Pont doesn't enter - he seems nervous. He looks at Stan. Stan hands him a sheet of paper.
STAN: Tonight's speech. All set. John takes the paper and glances at it. Then -
DU PONT: They're setting him up in the Yes, sir.
STAN BECK: Yes, sir.
DU PONT: Excellent bed. Firm mattress.
MARK: DU PONT
DU PONT: All right.
MARK: All right. Thank you, sir. And du Pont's gone, closing the door behind him. Beat.
STAN BECK: Shall we finish this? Mark sits.
MARK: STAN BECK
STAN BECK: Have you ever initiated a lawsuit?
BRANDON: ( re the horses ) They're Mrs. du Pont's. We all just keep our distance. They enter the WOODS. Just inside the trees is THE CHALET - a European style wooden guest house that is now Mark's home.
MARK: I didn't realize he was married.
BRANDON: Mr. du Pont? He's not. Mrs. du Pont's his mother.
BRANDON: Utilities are paid for - gas, electric. Refrigerator's stocked for now, but in the future you're responsible for feeding yourself. Unless of course you get invited to the Big House for dinner. Mark, still standing in the entry-way, accepts the keys.
MARK: Has he always lived with his Mr. du Pont? I think so.
BRANDON: Mr. du Pont? I think so.
MARK: Mr. du Pont, I want to thank you
DU PONT: You hear that? Mark listens, shakes his head. Du Pont holds up his finger again - and then we HEAR it: a faint HOOTING from the woods.
MARK: You wrote this?
DU PONT: I did. Mark seems genuinely touched and impressed.
MARK: Thank you. Do you want to come in?
DU PONT: No no -
MARK: - The fridge is full - you probably know better than me what's in there-
DU PONT: - No. You need your rest. You need to get started bright and early. Du Pont hold up his own set of binoculars.
MARK: Not even. 54 days.
DU PONT: 54 days.
MARK: All six wrestlers, Mark included, drop to the mats for 10 fast push-ups and sit-ups. The wrestlers are: ROBERTO GARCIA, aka "GECKO" ( 21 years old, 105 pounds, Latino, as fast a talker as he is a wrestler ); JIM ZEREGA - "JIMMY Z" ( 24, 114 lbs., blond Midwesterner ); MATT POPPER ( 24, 149 lbs., East coast working class ); BRUCE SPRINGER ( 27, also 149 lbs., half Asian ); MARK SCHULTZ ( 180 lbs. ); and DAN BANE ( 30, 198 lbs., strong and low-key, intelligent, from the West, like Mark. ) The wrestlers jump up - run in place incredibly fast.
DAN: Hey, Coach. Du Pont becomes at once an odd combination of a kid invited to join in and the actual boss and benefactor of this team.
DU PONT: Dan Bane. How's that hamstring?
DAN: Coming back. It's coming back.
DU PONT: Good. Good to hear. Hamstring coming back.
MARK: ( walking up to him ) Sir, you need me for something?
DU PONT: No no. Later. Please. Continue.
MARK: ( nods, turns back ) Pair up. On the mat. Up and down. Popper, Springer, let's go. Springer's dragging a bit, clearly wiped out.
GARCIA: Spling Loll - must lay off the pohk flied lice.
SPRINGER: ( EXHAUSTED )
MARK: They all go to it - the top wrestler trying to get a hold secure enough to turn the other - and the down wrestler splayed on the mat, fending him off. Du Pont hovers nearby, watching intently. We can sense his fascination - his admiration for these athletes. Also, his jealousy - how desperately he'd love to be part of this brotherhood.. He CLAPS, like a coach would..
DU PONT: ( awkward, not loud enough ) EXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - LATE AFTERNOON Mark, freshly showered, walks across the yard from the field house gym to the Big House.
DU PONT: I can't get you anything at all?
MARK: No, thank you. I'm good.
DU PONT: In training. Excellent. He comes over and sits. He's immediately hushed and serious.
MARK: Gecko? Great wrestler. What do you want to know? Du Pont sits there nodding. He's mulling something.
DU PONT: Just a sense. Keep your eye on him. Let me know of anything suspicious. Subversive. Anti.
MARK: DU PONT
DU PONT: Anything at all. Phone calls. ( no idea what that means ) I will. Du Pont stands and goes over to a carved WOODEN EAGLE on top of one of the desk.
MARK: ( no idea what that means ) I will. Du Pont stands and goes over to a carved WOODEN EAGLE on top of one of the desk.
DU PONT: You see the artistry, the care, the craftsmanship that went into making this great American symbol? You see the face hidden among the feathers?
MARK: How do you mean?
DU PONT: You were going to speak to him again. When's he coming?
MARK: Right. Look. Dave's. he's got a good situation going up in Madison. He's. he doesn't want to uproot. The family. Just at the moment.
DU PONT: He is a world class competitor - a world class coach. We are building a world class team. He belongs here. Tell me what I have to offer Mr. du Pont, I don't. you can't buy Dave. Silence. Du Pont's clearly not happy with this answer.
MARK: Mr. du Pont, I don't. you can't buy Dave. Silence. Du Pont's clearly not happy with this answer.
DU PONT: Wrestle and coach. We all coach each other. Support each other. His tone suddenly turns bright and positive -
MARK: Right to left. Du Pont looks at him, then back at the drawings. On the two of them - studying, contemplating.
DAN: I'll catch up with you all later. Zerega and Popper jog off. Dan comes to stand next to Mark, who has taken his little pair of BINOCULARS from the pocket of his sweats and is looking through them. After a moment, he hands Dan the binoculars. Dan looks through them.
MARK: I'm pretty sure that's John's BINOCULARS POV: A VERY OLD WOMAN stands in front of her wheelchair, with the help of an attendant. When the horses reach her, she TOUCHES THEM LOVINGLY, tenderly stroking their faces, feeding them treats from her hands. She's completely at home with these animals, as they are with her.
DANIELLE: One. twois. quatro! Nancy laughs. Dave wrestles with Alexander on the other bed.
DAVE: .Fireman's carry. to a half- nelson. to a chicken wing. Wait! A chicken wing? He starts to gobble up Alex's arm, who SHRIEKS in delight.
MARK: - a scrambled-egg!. a feather- Dave's plucking Alex and Alex is cracking up.
DAVE: - a scrambled-egg!. a feather- Dave's plucking Alex and Alex is cracking up.
MARK: Hey, Mark
DAVE: Hey, Mark
MARK: Come meet Mr. du Pont. Dave sweeps up Alex and throws him over his shoulder, carrying him to the door. He SHAKES du Pont's HAND.
DAVE: Hi. Dave Schultz.
DU PONT: John du Pont. It's a pleasure to meet you in person finally.
MARK: ( TO DAVE )
DAVE: This is Alex, that's my wife, Nancy, our daughter Danielle.
NANCY: DU PONT
DU PONT: Come on in. Can I get you a drink -
DAVE: Come on in. Can I get you a drink -
DU PONT: No no.
DAVE: You sure - ?
DU PONT: Thank you. No. I need to be getting back. But, don't worry - we'll make a Foxcatcher out of you yet. ( he laughs awkwardly ) Until tomorrow. And he's GONE. Beat. Dave shrugs.
DAVE: Well, I know what I need.
MARK: Turkey drumstick! He throws Alex on the bed and jumps on him. Alex SQUEALS. Mark heads for the TV across the room. Pops in his video.
DAVE: Turkey drumstick! He throws Alex on the bed and jumps on him. Alex SQUEALS. Mark heads for the TV across the room. Pops in his video.
MARK: Dave, check out the tape I have on
DAVE: ( STILL WRESTLING ) YEAH -
MARK: I want to show you this downblock -
DAVE: Cue it up. As the tape cues up, Mark glances at Nancy.
MARK: Too difficult to come say hello to Mr. du Pont?
NANCY: I said hello. ( lights a CIGARETTE ) I'm watching my kid.
MARK: It's John du Pont. One of the most generous men in America. He's gonna save USA Wrestling. ( re. cigarette ) Can you not do that in here?
NANCY: Do what?
MARK: I wrestle tomorrow.
NANCY: I wrestle tomorrow.
MARK: I wrestle tomorrow.
NANCY: It's my room, Mark. You don't have to be here.
MARK: I'm trying to get advice from my brother, get ready for the finals -
NANCY: Go get ready -
MARK: You start smoking - ?
NANCY: You can leave. Go to your own room -
MARK: - Your kids are in here - She BLOWS SMOKE at him.
DAVE: Mark. Calm down.
MARK: I'm not the one frigging smoking.
DAVE: The window's open. Relax. Show me what you want me to look at. Mark looks around the room. At Alexander giggling on the bed, at Danielle bouncing, Nancy BLOWING SMOKE RINGS. It's all too much. He pulls out the videotape and WALKS OUT the door.
DU PONT: I think you're up. Silence. Du Pont goes over to him, unsure what to do. Uncomfortable, he puts his hand on Mark's shoulder.
MARK: I don't want to let you down.
DU PONT: I can't.. I've watched you these past months. ( long beat, then quietly ) I can't imagine being let down by Mark stops shaking. Du Pont stands patiently beside him.
DU PONT: Let's clear it out! He gestures toward the center section of the enormous TROPHY CASE - the entirety of which is filled with horse-jumping and fox-hunting medals, ribbons and plaques. Some of the wrestlers open the glass doors and start taking down what's in there. A few of the others open more liquor.
SPRINGER: You sure about this?
DU PONT: Mother's idea of sport is riding a horse that's chasing a dog that's chasing a fox. I don't share her affection for horseflesh - The center case is cleared out.
WRESTLERS: ( CHANTING TOGETHER )
DU PONT: You've brought honor to Team He starts to walk toward him.
DAN: You all right, Coach? Du Pont starts LAUGHING out loud. Hugely relieved, Dan holds his hand out to him to help him up. Du Pont takes Dan's hand and promptly pulls him to the ground. and. JUMPS on his back - WRESTLING with him. The wrestlers, including Mark, go crazy, CHEERING him on. Dan lets du Pont get the best of him. lets du Pont PIN him. The wrestlers are cheering madly as du Pont stands with his arms raised. He makes as if he's about to do a back flip ( like Mark ), then sits and does a clumsy backwards somersault. Wild cheers.
DU PONT: More drinks! He's on his knees, fists in the air, head thrown back -
DU PONT: 321 days to Seoul, gentlemen. 321 days. Let's get to work. He gestures for Mark to join him.
DU PONT: America doesn't respect you. Doesn't place any value on you at all. I reward accomplishment.
MARK: Thank you, Coach.
DU PONT: Please. Call me John. Or Coach. Whichever you prefer. Maybe Eagle. Or Coach. Eagle is good.
MARK: Yes. Yes, I did. I.
DU PONT: Do you believe in this team?
MARK: Of course I -
DU PONT: - Do you believe we deserve this country's best talent?
MARK: I do -
DU PONT: - I pay for results not only on the mat, but in recruiting the best of the best to Foxcatcher Farms. That's part of your job. Silence. Mark looks shamed by this.
MARK: ( TENTATIVE )
DU PONT: - Well. You're the public face of If that's what -
MARK: If that's what -
DU PONT: - What do you know about Masters League wrestling tournaments?
MARK: Uh - well - not all that much -
DU PONT: - Because I'm thinking of entering Beat. Mark nods -
MARK: CUT TO:
PHOTOGRAPHER: He wears the singlet -
DU PONT: - and the gold medal -
PHOTOGRAPHER: - and, of course, the gold medal. And a lot of oil. Mark's in a dressing area wearing his FOXCATCHER SINGLET and Olympic gold. Two assistants stuff his crotch with a bit of A lot of oil. Please. More oil. It defines the musculature. Mark walks to his spot in front of the scrim. The two assistants slather baby oil on his arms and chest and legs as the photographer SHOWS him the pose on the monitor.
MARK: You good with this?
DU PONT: It's wonderful. It's exactly what I needed from you. The photographer takes his place behind the camera as the assistants finish with the baby oil and clear away.
PHOTOGRAPHER: Good! Now. Mark. You're winning the gold medal! And you are humbled! Mark raises his arms and glances down. FLASH. FLASH.
DU PONT: I think you were below me by a couple of steps when you hugged me at the Worlds.
PHOTOGRAPHER: It's true.
DU PONT: Maybe if you kneeled.
MARK: Kneeled now? On the floor.
DU PONT: No. No. You should kneel. Mark kneels in front of du Pont. Hugs him. FLASH. FLASH.
DU PONT: Brandon and I prepared some Mark takes the paper and reads it over. He looks worried.
MARK: Read it?
DU PONT: Read the speech.
MARK: ( READING )
DU PONT: The helicopter nears the LIT UP city of WASHINGTON D.C.
STEVE: In that case, the Grand Old Party wants to help find you one. Graham calls over to the 3-star GENERAL in full dress uniform who's chewing on a cigar and drinking gin with a Senator.
GENERAL: Which? We might have a couple of those left on the lot. ( to du Pont ) You gonna need financing? Everyone laughs. Du Pont smiles.
DU PONT: What I need is the gun turret. Don't send me one without that MK- 19 mounted on top.
GENERAL: Uh. I don't know there, son. Civilians don't usually get 40mm blowback grenade launchers.
STEVE: General, John du Pont is hardly your usual civilian. The General turns back to the Senator, grumbling -
GENERAL: Am I supposed to get him a 12-pack of live fucking grenades, too?
MARK: . highly respected ornithologist, author, world explorer, phil. Du Pont watches from the wings, whispers:
DU PONT: Mark looks over at him blankly - he has no idea what du Pont just said.
PHILAT: ( GIVING UP )
MARK: Stamp collector, and former Jean, in the audience, in her wheelchair, almost imperceptibly shakes her head.
DU PONT: Mark Schultz. Thank you, son. ( waves to Jean in
AUDIENCE ): Hello, Mother. ( to them all ) The gold medal Mark won in 1984 was tarnished. Tarnished by Jimmy Carter. Tarnished by the unpatriotic acts of that democrat administration. He caused the entire Eastern bloc to boycott our Los Angeles Games. Mark will have an opportunity to shine up that medal at the World Championships in just a few short weeks. To prove his worth in front of the assembled nations of the globe.
MARK: Ready? Go. Du Pont clumsily attempts the escape. Mark is incredibly gentle with him, even tender, easing him through the moves.
MARK: ( to du Pont ) Just a sec.
MARK: Looking good.
DU PONT: I appreciate this.
MARK: You've done the training, you learned the moves. You're ready to rumble, boss.
DU PONT: No. Mark. I appreciate this.
MARK: ( after a moment ) It's nothing.
DU PONT: When I was fourteen - my father had left us long before that - my best friend was Clifford Holt, our gardener's son. Then I found out Mother had been paying Cliff to be friends with me. Mark is moved, but doesn't know what to say.
MARK: We all have demons.
DU PONT: ( TOTALLY SINCERE )
MARK: When Dave's son, Alex, was born he had some problems with his lungs. It looked like he wasn't gonna live. I was sitting in the hospital waiting room, and all I could think was: Maybe it's better if he dies. Dave won't be distracted. We can get back to training together.
DU PONT: Conquer demons. He FIRES again, a short burst of bullets into the dark. Du Pont fires again, a sustained volley into the dark.
MARK: ( over the gunfire ) Du Pont ceases fire and looks out. He begins lowering the gun when it accidentally goes off, firing a few bullets into the wood deck - though he doesn't seem to notice.
DU PONT: They're dead.
MARK: When he gives you the slightest opening, you gotta shoot in on him. Be aggressive. Show him who's boss. Du Pont nods wearily. He can barely move.
DU PONT: . Some of the older prizes in the trophy case.
JEAN: Which ribbons?
DU PONT: I'm sorry?
JEAN: Which ribbons did you move?
DU PONT: Just some of the older ones. From the case. From the Rosemont case. I'll have a look later to see exactly what you've done.
JEAN: I'll have a look later to see exactly what you've done.
MARK: ( COMPLETELY GENUINE )
DU PONT: I went by the gym - it's almost noon - and there's no one in there. There is no one in there. In the Yeah, no, exactly - we've got an intense workout scheduled this afternoon. Real intense one. So we're taking the morning to rest Who precisely is in charge around Well, I mean, I am.
MARK: Yeah, no, exactly - we've got an intense workout scheduled this afternoon. Real intense one. So we're taking the morning to rest Who precisely is in charge around Well, I mean, I am.
DU PONT: Who precisely is in charge around Well, I mean, I am.
MARK: Well, I mean, I am.
DU PONT: Where do we stand on Dave?
MARK: ( BEAT )
DU PONT: David Schultz. Your brother. When is he coming to Foxcatcher?
MARK: John, seriously, I don't know how else to say it. It's not gonna happen. You can't buy Dave. It's just not gonna happen. Du Pont SLAPS Mark. HARD. Across the face. SILENCE. Mark could destroy du Pont. He doesn't seem to even consider it. He just stands there, like a chastened schoolboy, his face reddening. Du Pont WALKS OUT past the muted UFC on TV - Once he's gone, no one speaks. Then:
GARCIA: You got bitch-slapped. Mark turns to Garcia.
MARK: Hello?. Hello? He starts up the stairs, two at a time. Stan Beck comes out of his office, meets him at the top.
STAN BECK: Mark. How are things?
MARK: I need to see John.
STAN BECK: Mr. du Pont's not available right Stan, please. I need to see him.
MARK: Stan, please. I need to see him.
STAN BECK: He's got a very full schedule this afternoon. But I'll let him know you stopped by.
MARK: ( more and more upset ) Listen - I - something happened. There was a - misunderstanding. I think I did something wrong and I really need to talk to him about it-
STAN BECK: - Mark, I hear you. But Mr. du Pont's away for the afternoon on business. He's simply not here. Mark doesn't move.
DU PONT: New moves. Wrestling moves. Need to try them out.
MARK: Oh, uh -
DU PONT: In the gym. Beat. Mark forces the cobwebs from his head.
MARK: Yeah, of course. Just. just give me a minute.
DAVE: Hey, Dave.
MARK: Hey, Dave.
DAVE: How you doing?
MARK: Good. I'm good.
DAVE: I hadn't seen you yet. I just want to make sure everything's okay.
MARK: Yeah. I'm just concentrating. Trials are in 50 days. You know, Nancy and the kids are How they doing?
DAVE: You know, Nancy and the kids are How they doing?
MARK: How they doing?
DAVE: Good. You should stop in, say hi.
MARK: I will.
DAVE: There's this big match between an American and a Russian. The Russian is a monster, never lost, kills everybody with this hold called The Pretzel. So the American coach tells his wrestler, "Listen, whatever you do don't let this guy get you in The Pretzel or you're dead." Sure enough, match starts, the Russian gets him in The There are smiles around the table.
DAVE: He gives you opportunity, jump on it. Hard. Drive him down.
DU PONT: No mercy! Dave looks at du Pont, surprised by the comment - that John's actually behaving as if he's coaching. Dave looks at some of the wrestlers, realizes this is the norm. He laughs, pats du Pont on the back.
DAVE: ( to the wrestlers ) Okay. Okay. You heard the Head Coach. No mercy. Mark walks out of the wrestling room to the weight room. Du Pont is thrilled to be validated for a moment. Then -
DU PONT: Keep it up, gentlemen. Largely ignored, he drifts off into the weight room.
DU PONT: Your brother's taking the reins. Mark finishes his set, stares straight ahead, catching his DU PONT ( CONT'D ) You've got more in you than that. Mark turns his gaze to du Pont. SILENCE. Du Pont walks over behind him, starts massaging Mark's shoulders.
MARK: ( QUIET )
DU PONT: Conquer your demons, Mark.
MARK: ( QUIET )
DAVE: Why'd you take off so suddenly?
MARK: ( STILL WATCHING )
DAVE: You been doing this since you left?
MARK: Pretty much. Beat. Dave stands there as Mark keeps watching.
DAVE: What's going on with you and John?
MARK: ( STILL WATCHING )
DAVE: You seemed kind of upset in the The fuck you talking about?
MARK: ( STILL WATCHING )
DU PONT: He was talking to you about something and you seemed pretty What was he saying to you?
MARK: I don't know what you're talking Okay. You want me to leave you alone, I'll leave you alone. You decide you want to talk, you know where to find me. Dave walks out. Mark keeps watching his videotape.
DAVE: Okay. You want me to leave you alone, I'll leave you alone. You decide you want to talk, you know where to find me. Dave walks out. Mark keeps watching his videotape.
DU PONT: David Schultz. Dave. Dave looks around the open hood.
DAVE: Hey, Coach.
DU PONT: I'd like to show you something. Why don't you hop in? It's more than a little odd that du Pont hasn't acknowledged anyone else.
DAVE: WELL - DU PONT
DU PONT: - Need to show you something. At the battlefield. Come. Sit. Come.
DAVE: You know what, Coach? It's Sunday. Family time. Du Pont stands there as if he hasn't quite registered what Dave said. Beat. Beat. Nancy calls out from the steps.
NANCY: Good morning, John. Du Pont looks over at her as if he's just noticed her Family time. Ah. Very good. He turns, gets back in his car.
DU PONT: Family time. Ah. Very good. He turns, gets back in his car.
DU PONT: And.. break! Gentlemen, well done! Listen up. Team. Listen up. Several wrestlers GLANCE toward Dave to check his reaction to this. Dave NODS his head in du Pont's direction.
GARCIA: ( mutters under his breath ) My fucking name's Roberto, Springer smiles. Garcia stands. He's clearly the SMALLEST WRESTLER in the room. He approaches du Pont. INTERCUT: Mark sprinting through the woods.
DU PONT: Muchas gracias, compadre. ( gestures to the mat ) Por favor. Garcia gets in the down position. Du Pont kneels next to him, his arms hovering over him, not yet grabbing on.
DAVE: Get after him, Mark! Shoot low!. Du Pont, BEING FILMED, claps, calls out instruction -
DU PONT: Need to get after him, there. Low low low.
DAVE: He's open to the left. He leaves his entire left side open. You gotta get after that fucker! Make him pay. Now or never.
DU PONT: Next time, Mark. A good effort.
DAVE: Open up - I know you're in there. Mark walks away from the door.
MARK: I'm done.
DAVE: What does that mean?
MARK: It's over. I'm done. You lost. I lost. It's over. Dave walks over to Mark, and CUFFS him, hard, on the side of the head. He hits him again. Hard.
DAVE: Look at me. Look at me. You have a chance to do what no wrestler's done since 1904. Not one. If you think I'm gonna let you throw away a chance to win back-to-back Olympic golds you're fucking crazy. Dave CUFFS him again, harder.
DAVE: ( under his breath ) The official MOVES the slide weight up from 82 KILOS to.
OFFICIAL: 87 kilos.
DAVE: How long does he have to make The official glances up at the CLOCK.
OFFICIAL: Weigh-in period ends at 3:30pm. Dave nods. Grabs Mark.
DAVE: C'mon, fat boy, you got 90 minutes to cut 12 pounds.
DU PONT: Here you are. I've been looking all over for you Dave immediately trots over to du Pont, heading him off. We SEE their conversation from Mark's POV ( we'll hear only pieces of it ): Dave explains how Mark needs to be left alone. Du Pont resists at first; Dave is gentle but firm. He tells du Pont he shouldn't be in Mark's corner right now. Finally, du Pont turns and WALKS OUT. Dave turns back toward Mark. Mark puts his head down and PEDALS even harder.
DAVE: Wait! Wait! We're here.
OFFICIAL: 82 kilos.
DAVE: Mark. Drink. Mark just sits there. Not taking the drink.
DAVE: Dave's EXULTANT - leaping and screaming onto the mat - he grabs his brother in a BEAR HUG and LIFTS him off the mat. As Dave joyfully carries his exhausted, victorious brother around the mat, he glances over at where du Pont would be sitting. Empty seat.
YAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!: Dave's EXULTANT - leaping and screaming onto the mat - he grabs his brother in a BEAR HUG and LIFTS him off the mat. As Dave joyfully carries his exhausted, victorious brother around the mat, he glances over at where du Pont would be sitting. Empty seat.
DAVE: Hey, Stan.
STAN BECK: Dave. What can I do for you?
DAVE: I'm having some trouble finding John. He's not in his room -
STAN BECK: - Right.
DAVE: - I wanted to check in with him. I had a kind of uncomfortable thing with John before the match this afternoon - Mark was in a really delicate place, and I had to ask John to not be in his corner. I just wanted to make sure he's okay with everything. And that he's happy with the result. With how things turned out.
STAN BECK: Dave. Mr. du Pont's mother died this morning. He flew home to Philadelphia earlier today. On Dave, stunned. Dylan's "All the Tired Horses" STARTS TO PLAY.
GUARD: Can I help you?
DAVE: ( leaning across Nancy ) What's going on?
GUARD: How can I help you?
DAVE: We live here. We're part of Team Your names?
GUARD: Your names?
DAVE: What's going on?
GUARD: New security plan. Names?
DAVE: Dave and Nancy Schultz. Mark Can I see some picture ID's?
GUARD: Can I see some picture ID's?
DAVE: Are you serious?
GUARD: They hand over their driver's licences. Mark reaches to hand his over from the back seat -
DAVE: ( TO GUARD )
GUARD: This is for you, sir.
MARK: Tomorrow morning?
DAVE: YEAH - 7 O'CLOCK -
MARK: 7 O'CLOCK -
DAVE: I'll pick you up tomorrow, 7am.
MARK: I'll pick you up tomorrow, 7am.
DAVE: You got it. Mark starts off, then turns quickly -
MARK: Wait - your house, right? Dave has to laugh.
DAVE: Congrats, my brother. As Mark walks into the Chalet, he looks over toward the Big House, where he can see a SECURITY DETAIL fanned out on the lawn, sweeping the ground with metal detectors. IN THE CAR: Dave looks down at envelope in his hand.
NANCY: What you got, baby? Opens it. Beat.
DAVE: John wrote me a check for ten thousand dollars.
DU PONT: No no. All's fine. There's work to be done.
DAVE: Mark. Focus. Look at me. ( Mark looks at him ) Focus on me.
DU PONT: If you and I can't get him there, no one can. We're in this together. After a long moment, du Pont moves off the mat. He starts to stretch nearby. As Dave tries to get Mark back to work, du Pont starts to JOG around the perimeter of the gym. Mark's trying to keep it together, but it's clearly driving him insane. As du Pont jogs and jogs -
DU PONT: .I wear many hats. I am leader. Mentor. Father figure. Brother. Older brother. At times the INT. DU PONT'S OFFICE/BIG HOUSE - DAY From a WIDER ANGLE, we see that he's being FILMED for the documentary. He wears his Foxcatcher sweat jacket with HEAD COACH and JOHN `Eagle' du PONT" stitched onto it.
DU PONT: It will not be easy. We have built. our family. Our obligation. is to build. winners. In life. To teach the secret. To build men who will. think of. Who will understand. the character traits. We must teach them. whether they will listen or no.
FRED COLE: We're so very sorry about your mother's passing. Du Pont doesn't look up, just meticulously cleans each part of the gun. Almost mumbling:
DU PONT: Yes. Very sad. Very sad days here. Here at the farm. He keeps his focus on the disassembled gun, wiping clean each piece. Silence, then -
FRED COLE: Well, whatever we can do. What we wanted to discuss. Mr. Du Pont spends a significant amount of money for wrestlers' training here at Foxcatcher. Now - in addition - he'd like to make a sizable direct donation to USA Wrestling.
STAN BECK: What we wanted to discuss. Mr. Du Pont spends a significant amount of money for wrestlers' training here at Foxcatcher. Now - in addition - he'd like to make a sizable direct donation to USA Wrestling.
FRED COLE: May I ask what sort of a donation we're discussing?
STAN BECK: Four hundred thousand dollars. Fred chokes on his glass of water.
DU PONT: ( under his breath ) And gym bags.
STAN BECK: And gym bags. Beat. Fred glances at his fellow officials.
MARK: ( GASPING )
MARK: What -?
STAN BECK: We believe that Eagle has earned the right to be named to the official roster of Olympic coaches at Seoul. Which means he would be in Mark Schultz's corner throughout the games. Fred looks over at Dave.
FRED COLE: We'll all, of course, just need to get him to sign off on this.
STAN BECK: You can take care of that?
DAVE: I can try.
DAVE: You're late.
MARK: Were you in the Big House For a little while.
DAVE: For a little while.
MARK: In the afternoon? Because I got turned away when I came within fifty yards of the house.
DAVE: I'm a coach here. I get paid by John. I was meeting with John.
MARK: About what?
DAVE: Mark. Get dressed.
MARK: He's weakening me.
DAVE: What are you talking about?
MARK: I talked to Bachman at SMU last night. He says they're expanding the program. There'll be room for both of us in the fall -
DAVE: - Mark -
MARK: - I told him we could all get on the phone next weekend -
DAVE: - You need to focus on what's happening a month from now. Not -
MARK: - SMU's gonna make a move, they're gonna take a run at it - we can be there at the beginning -
DAVE: - Don't do this. Don't do it. Stay clear about what we're working for.
MARK: - I can't do this anymore. I can't do it -
DAVE: - It's not the time, Mark -
MARK: - John's killing me here -
DAVE: - He's not killing you -
MARK: - If we at least let Bachman know by the end of the week we'll have a place to go to after -
DAVE: - Stop. Stop it! Long beat as Dave looks at Mark. As gently as he can:
MARK: You're not thinking of staying I don't know, Mark. The schools are great, the kids are happy. They have eight hundred acres to run around in. Mark's at a complete loss. Just when he'd reconnected with his brother, it seems they'll be separated again.
DAVE: I don't know, Mark. The schools are great, the kids are happy. They have eight hundred acres to run around in. Mark's at a complete loss. Just when he'd reconnected with his brother, it seems they'll be separated again.
MARK: ( QUIETLY )
DAVE: That's right.
MARK: And you'll be here.
DAVE: I'll be here. Whenever you need me. Mark seems lost. Dave pats him on the shoulder and turns to walk toward his office. Mark watches him walk away, then -
MARK: What's on your forehead?
DAVE: It says kids.
MARK: It says kids.
DAVE: To remind me to pick up the kids from school.
MARK: What does that mean? When are you gonna you see your own forehead?
DAVE: I don't have to. You just told me. On Mark, PRELAP:
CORPORAL: Here we go, sir. Five tons of fun.
CORPORAL: That's one beautiful vehicle. The CORPORAL watches du Pont climb atop the APC.
DU PONT: Where's the grenade launcher?
CORPORAL: I'm sorry?
DU PONT: The 40mm grenade launcher that's supposed to be mounted up here. The Corporal pages through the sheets of his delivery order.
CORPORAL: I don't know, sir. I don't. I don't see anything in the order -
DU PONT: - It goes right here. Right here.
CORPORAL: Yes, it does. It does mount right there on the top.
DU PONT: So where is it?
DAVE: My name's Dave Schultz. I'm Coach and head of recruiting here at Foxcatcher, under Head Coach John "Eagle" du Pont -
DAVE: ( halting; trying so hard ) - His. commitment to this sport is complete. He's made himself um, an. an expert in the sport of Dave, who's been so good at playing along, takes it too far even for himself. As he says the next bit, he stumbles over his words -
UNCOMFORTABLE ): We. consider John.
DAVE: I'll commit to remaining at Foxcatcher so long as John wants me here, but only if my brother is taken care of.
STAN BECK: Taken care of how?
DAVE: So long as I'm here, Mark will continue to be paid.
STAN BECK: Paid what?
DAVE: His full salary.
STAN BECK: You want him paid even if he leaves? What if he quits?
DAVE: Whether or not he chooses to stay. That's right.
STAN BECK: You're making quite an assumption about the value of your presence You're welcome to test the theory.
DAVE: You're welcome to test the theory.
STAN BECK: What does that mean?
DAVE: We can see how many wrestlers stay if I decide to go.
STAN BECK: ( TO MARK )
DAVE: He'd like the option. Stan leans over to du Pont and WHISPERS in his ear. It goes on for several seconds. Finally, du Pont NODS very slightly.
STAN BECK: First of all, Mark has always been free to train in whatever -
DAVE: - That's not exactly how it's -
STAN BECK: - Just a minute - you've had your - To train in whatever way is most effective for him. Eagle offers his advice and counsel. If Mark chooses to ignore it, that's his loss.
DAVE: STAN BECK
STAN BECK: - To train in whatever way is most effective for him. Eagle offers his advice and counsel. If Mark chooses to ignore it, that's his loss.
DAVE: What's that?
STAN BECK: That John du Pont, Head Coach of Team Foxcatcher, be seated in Mark's corner throughout the Olympic Games. Mark looks at Dave. Quiet, betrayed
MARK: You've talked about this?
DAVE: I was waiting for the right moment to bring it up with you. You haven't exactly been in a receptive frame of mind. A long beat. Then Mark shrugs, and looks away from his brother. He's given up fighting this fight.
STAN BECK: All right, then. I guess we're Silence as they all just sit there.
DAVE: This is your moment to prove yourself - your moment to step out alone, away from everyone, into the spotlight. This has nothing to do with me, nothing to do with John - Du Pont hovers a few feet behind Dave, being filmed by his CAMERA CREW. Mark's eyes keep glancing over at him.
ANNOUNCER: From the United States of America, at 82 kilos. Mark Schultz. Mark walks onto the mat. CHANTS of "U.S.A. U.S.A." from the Americans in the stands. waving flags and shouting. Mark faces his Bulgarian opponent in the center of the mat as each are checked by the REFEREE. As Mark is patted down, he glances over at his corner: du Pont is talking in Dave's ear, and Dave HAS HIS ARM AROUND du Pont's shoulders, listening. The camera crew films them.
REFEREE: Mark's immediately taken down, for a moment ONTO HIS BACK.
GUARD: On Mark, looking at him.
DU PONT: From the under hook, pivot sideways while pulling down on his arm. Kneel between his legs and take him to the mat. Mark lets du Pont take him down, though it's abundantly apparent how much Mark is gritting his teeth through this.
DAVE: He's made himself an - an expert in the art and sport of wrestling. Dave stumbles on the words -
DU PONT: Our challenge. as coaches. as leaders. I have coached. and psychologically prepare. our Mark Schultz. to capture Olympic Gold. I wear many hats. I am leader. Mentor. Father figure. Brother. A SHOT of a GOLDEN EAGLE sitting on a tree branch, then flying away.
DOCUMENTARY DIRECTOR: We've bought several time slots next week on local station WPHI -
DU PONT: ( STILL MOVING ) DOCUMENTARY DIRECTOR
DOCUMENTARY DIRECTOR: - Several late night slots, of course, but there was also an open afternoon half-hour, directly after "The Edge of Night." That should be a good one - Du Pont continues right out the door, down the hallway, not even turning to face him.
DU PONT: The Director stops at the door. He calls out to du Pont
DOCUMENTARY DIRECTOR: - I'll let you know what the viewership numbers are as soon as I have them.
DU PONT: Northern Cardinal. Look at that.
DU PONT: They never leave home, no matter how cold it gets.
DAVE: Hey, Coach. Dave takes a step toward du Pont's car. Du Pont just looks at him through his open driver's window.
DU PONT: You got a problem with me?
DAVE: JOHN -
NANCY: Dave!.. David!. Nancy runs onto the porch and is screaming for her husband. Du Pont POINTS the pistol at her. She RUNS inside. Du Pont SHOOTS Dave in the back. Then he SHOOTS him in the back of the head. After a few moments, he drives away. Nancy runs outside. She cradles her husband as he bleeds out in the snow.
