FRANKENWEENIE: Written by John August
MOM (O.S.): Victor, I don't know that it's...
VICTOR (O.S.): Mom, you have to wear the glasses.
MOM (O.S.): Oh!     Yes of course.
DAD: In 3D honey.
MOM: So that's where my candlestick went.
DAD: Oh, isn't that your grandmother's table cloth.
MOM: That looks great! Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   2
DAD: Oh that is so...Woah! I just felt I was attacked.
MOM: Oh. That's scary.
DAD: Send in the marines!
ARMY FIGURE: Over here men. This way.
MOM: Oh! Watch out!
DAD: Whoah!
MOM: Sparky!
DAD: Sparky that's you!
MOM: Oh!
DAD: You tell em' Sparky.
DAD: Bravo!
MOM: Oh!   Oh! Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2       3
DAD: Um. Maybe just unplug it.
MOM: Well it certainly was exciting!
DAD: Yeah, it was a big finish. Well done son.
VICTOR: I can fix this. C'mon boy!
DAD (O.S.): All that time he spends up there. A boy his age needs to be outside with his friends.
MOM (O.S.): I don't know that Victor has friends, dear. Other than Sparky.
DAD (O.S.): That's my point! I don't want him to turn out, y'know, weird.
MOM (O.S): There's nothing wrong with Victor. He's just in his own world. Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   4
DAD: See you later, sweetie.
MOM: Have a good day! Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2    5
MOM: Victor! Come on honey your going to be late. Go put Sparky in the backyard.
VICTOR: Come on Sparky!
VICTOR: Good morning, Mr. Burgemeister!
BURGEMEISTER: Your dog has been sniffing around my Dutch Dazzlers. The other day I caught him peeing on my flamingo.
VICTOR: I'll keep an eye on him.
BURGEMEISTER: You better.
VICTOR: Yes sir.
VICTOR: Go on Sparky. That's right. Good boy.
VICTOR: See you later! Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   6
BURGEMEISTER: Where do you think you're going?
ELSA: School.
BURGEMEISTER: Is that so. What about that dog of yours?
ELSA: She's not in the house and she's away from your tulips.
BURGEMEISTER: I want you to remember something, while your parents are away I am in charge here.
ELSA: Yes, Uncle Bob.
BURGEMEISTER: Dutch Day is coming up and I don't need any trouble. How's your song coming?
ELSA: Okay.
BURGEMEISTER: Keep at it. Dutch day is a big day for me.
ELSA: Yes sir. Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   7
MR. RZYKRUSKI: Good morning children. I am Mr. Rzykruski. I will be your new science teacher. Apparently, Mr. Holcum had an incident.
E: He got hit by lightning.
MR. RZYKRUSKI: Well. That is bad. But he did not get "hit by" lightning. Lightning does not hit a person, the way one is hit by a baseball or a cabbage.
MR. RZYKRUSKI: Lightning is simply electricity. The cloud is angry, yes, making storm. All the electrons are saying, "I am leaving you. I go to land of opportunity."
MR. RZYKRUSKI: The ground says, "Yes, we need electrons trained in science just like you. Come! Come! Welcome!" So both sides start to build a ladder. (drawing stick figure) This man, he comes out to look at the storm. He does not see the invisible ladders. When the two ladders meet, BOOM! The circuit is complete and all of the electrons rush to the land of opportunity. This man is in the way. Yiii! Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2     8
MR. RZYKRUSKI: But is very rare to have such incident.
TOSHIAKI: But it's not rare. Lightning happens to people all the time here. There's a thunderstorm almost every night.
BOB: My dad got hit twice.
WEIRD GIRL: They built New Holland on an abandoned gold mine...
TOSHIAKI: I heard it was a cemetery.
WEIRD GIRL: That's where they buried the miners.
NASSOR: It's the windmill that does it.
NASSOR: Turning, turning the air until the sky itself rages against the night.
WEIRD GIRL: No.   Cemetery. Definitely.
MR. RZYKRUSKI: Students on your way out, take a permission slip for the Science Fair.
BOB: (per the form) First prize is a huge trophy! Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2     10
WEIRD GIRL: Hello, Victor.
VICTOR: Hi.
WEIRD GIRL: Mr. Whiskers had a dream about you last night.
VICTOR: How do you know?
WEIRD GIRL: Because this morning, he made this.
VICTOR: Did you get that out of the litter box?
WEIRD GIRL: It's an omen.
WEIRD GIRL (V.O.): Last month he dreamed about Bob.
WEIRD GIRL (V.O.): He fell in a manhole. Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   11
WEIRD GIRL (V.O.): He dreamed about Toshiaki the day he pitched a perfect game.
WEIRD GIRL (V.O.): ...and Nassor the day he got knocked unconscious.
WEIRD GIRL: If Mr. Whiskers dreams about you, it means something big is going to happen.
VICTOR: You can keep it.
WEIRD GIRL: One day you'll dream about me, won't you kitty?
VICTOR: Hey boy. How you doing?
E: You'll be my partner, right, Victor?
(MORE): Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   12
E (CONT'D): Because you have to have a partner for the science fair and whoever's your partner is going to win. You know the most about science. So pick me as a partner. I have lots of ideas. We could make a death ray!
VICTOR: It says no death rays.    See?
E: Ah, man. I still want to do it. (and yet...) C'mon. Who else would be your partner? You don't have friends and neither do I.
VICTOR: I'm sorry Edgar. I just don't need a partner. I like to work alone.
VICTOR: Will you sign my permission slip?
MOM: Dinner's ready.
DAD: Victor, have I ever talked to you about what I do for a living?
VICTOR: You're a travel agent.
DAD: I sell dreams. I tell people, you can sail to Italy. You can do the hula in Hawaii.
VICTOR: Will you sign my form?
DAD: I'm getting to that. Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   13
VICTOR: Okay.
DAD: In my job, sometimes you have people who don't want quite the same thing, right. Say the husband wants to play golf in Scotland, but the wife wants to paddle down the Amazon. Alright you've got two conflicting ideas here. (holding forks apart) And it's my job, Victor, to help them meet halfway. Say, Scottsdale, Arizona. He gets to golf, she gets Indians.
MOM: But there's no river. And no jungle.
VICTOR: Nobody gets what they want.
DAD: Exactly. And wrong. They both get what they want because they compromise.
DAD: You'd like to do this science fair. And that's great. I'd like you to try a sport. Say, I don't know, baseball. Science fair, baseball. Science fair, baseball. How do you choose? Guess what? You don't have to. No reason you can't do both. You meet in the middle. (bringing forks together) Everyone's happy.
DAD: Look at what Toshiaki's doing. Keeping his eye on the target. Never losing his concentration.
GYM TEACHER: Strike three! Next Batter!
MR. RZYKRUSKI: I want you to concentrate on your project for the science fair.
MOM: Come on honey!
TOSHIAKI: Nice catch Sparky.
DAD: Come on Victor, please. Tie Sparky up and get your head into the game.
GYM TEACHER: Time out!
VICTOR: Sorry boy. Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   15
ELSA: Hey Sparky.
GYM TEACHER: Play ball.
GYM TEACHER: Strike One.
DAD: Nice try son.
MR. RZYKRUSKI: When conducting an experiment, trying is the important thing. It is OK to fail as long as you keep trying.
MOM: Come on Victor- you can do it!
GYM TEACHER: Strike two!
TOSHIAKI: Yes.
MOM: Come on honey! Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2      16
DAD (CONT'D): Victor run!
MOM: Oh Sparky!
VICTOR: Sparky! Noooooo!
MOM: He was a great dog.    A great friend.
DAD: The best dog a kid could have.
MOM: When you lose someone you love, they never really leave you. They just move into a special place in your heart. He'll always be there, Victor.
VICTOR: I don't want him in my heart.    I want him here, with me.
MOM: I know. If we could bring him back, we would.
MOM: Try and get some sleep sweet heart- things will seem better in the morning.
MR. RZYKRUSKI: Just like lightning, the nervous system is electricity.
(MORE): Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   18
MR. RZYKRUSKI (CONT'D): We are wires and springs and cables to send the messages. "Foot! Move! You are standing in the fire!"
CHILDREN: Eww!
MR. RZYKRUSKI: Even after death, the wiring remains. Watch as the muscles respond to the electricity.
MOM: Hi Victor, how was school? Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   19
VICTOR: Ok.
VICTOR: I'm sorry, boy.
VICTOR: You're alive! You're alive! Sparky! You're Alive! I can't believe it you're alive!
VICTOR: I can fix that.
VICTOR: It worked. It really worked. Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2    22
MOM (O.S.): Victor!
MOM: Victor!     Breakfast!
MOM: Victor?     Are you up here?
VICTOR: Ssssh! Quiet down boy! Ssssh!
MOM (O.S.): Victor?
VICTOR: Sparky! Sssh! Quiet.
MOM (O.S.): Victor? Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   23
MOM: French toast or waffles?
VICTOR: Waffles.
MOM: Then I'll need my waffle iron back, Mr. Director.
VICTOR: It's my science project.   It's a robot.
MOM: A robotic bucket?
VICTOR: Yes.
MOM: For mopping, I suppose.
VICTOR: Yes.
MOM: Then maybe when you're finished, you'll let me use it.
VICTOR: Sorry, boy, but I can't let anyone know about you. They may not understand. So you need to stay here today. Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2    24
BURGEMEISTER: Watch it, there!
VICTOR: I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
MOM: No.   Couldn't be.
BOB'S MOTHER: What! screams Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2    26
FIRST WOMAN: I know, and Helen said she thought he was putting up some kind of tv antenna on top of the roof!
SECOND WOMAN: In the middle of a thunderstorm?
FIRST WOMAN: That's what she said!
SECOND MOTHER: And did you get that big power surge in the night? Jack thought it was a fuse box but apparently it effected the whole neighbourhood.
SECOND MOTHER (O.S.): Sometimes I wonder just what goes on in that house. I just don't feel safe walking by there.
FIRST WOMAN: Sweetie are you ok? Here you go.
SECOND MOTHER: So anyway Jack loves it here but if the schools weren't so great sometimes I wonder if we would be better of... Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   27
E: Sparky?
MOM: Hi Victor.   How was school?
VICTOR: GoodGottaGo.
VICTOR: Sparky?
VICTOR: Sparky?
VICTOR: There you are. Good boy!
VICTOR: Sorry you had to stay here alone all day.
VICTOR: What's the matter boy? Are you ok? Hmmm. You're a little low. Are you hungry, boy?
VICTOR: Alright, here lets top you up.
MOM (O.S.): Victor!   Could you come down here please? Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   29
MOM: Victor your friend is here.
VICTOR: Edgar?
E: Hey!
VICTOR: Edgar. What are you doing here?
E: I know.
VICTOR: What?
E: I know.
VICTOR: Know what?
E: You know.
VICTOR: No.
E: I think I know what you know I know.
VICTOR: Look, I don't know what you think I know, but I don't know it.
E: Your dog is alive.
VICTOR: That's impossible.
E: I know. I know it is so impossible but you did it. You did it. Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   30
E: So show me how, or I'll tell everyone. Oh Mrs Frankenstein...
VICTOR: Ssssh!
E: .. May I have a cookie please?
MOM: Oh- yes. Of course.
VICTOR: Alright. Come on.
VICTOR: I think the wind and the lightning are part of the same thing, some kind of strange force. But the wind isn't strong enough to bring an animal back from the dead. For that, you need lightning.
E: So when can I do it?
VICTOR: You can't. This isn't an experiment. It's my dog.
E: Show and tell Victor:   you show me and I won't tell.
PET STORE OWNER: Can I help you young man? Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2    31
E: I'd like to buy a fish.
PET STORE OWNER: Certainly.   Which one?
E: This one.
E: What do we do now?
E: What happened to it?    What did you do?
VICTOR: I don't know.    It should have worked. Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2    32
VICTOR: (in wonderment) It's invisible. It's an invisible goldfish.
E: Why is it invisible?
VICTOR: I have no idea.
VICTOR: You can't tell anyone. You understand that, right? Not until we figure out how it works.
E: Okay!    Okay!
VICTOR: Promise.
E: Promise.
TOSHIAKI: How are we supposed to see an invisible goldfish?
E: Put your finger in.       You can feel it. Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   33
BOB: Aaah!
BOB: It bit me.
TOSHIAKI: Let me see it.
E: It's my science project and it's top secret.
BOB: Yeah, well, our science fair project is even cooler.
E: What is it?
TOSHIAKI: Double top secret.
BOB: Sea monkeys. We gotta come up with something better. Bigger.
TOSHIAKI: I know.
BOB: The science fair is in two days!
TOSHIAKI: I know.
BOB: You're the smart one.
TOSHIAKI: I know!
VICTOR: Ok, ok, sit still. Ssssh! Sparky. No! Sssh. No! Sssh.
VICTOR: Sorry, boy. But we can't risk anyone seeing you again.
VICTOR: Ssssh!
NASSOR: Toshiaki says you have an invisible fish.
E: No he doesn't.
NASSOR: So you don't?
E: I didn't say that.       Who said I did?
NASSOR: Toshiaki says it's your science fair project.
E: If it was, I couldn't tell you.
NASSOR: So it isn't?    Or it is?
E: No.    Yes.   I'm confused.
NASSOR: Do you have an invisible fish?
E: Okay. But you have to keep it a secret.
E: Swish your finger around.      You can feel it.
NASSOR: It's just water. There's nothing there.
E: No, it's invisible?
E: Huh. Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   36
NASSOR: I don't know what kind of game you and Victor are playing. But that trophy will be mine!
E: Gasp
E: Victor! Something's wrong with my fish.
VICTOR: What is it?
E: It's not there anymore.
VICTOR: Maybe it just hopped out.   Did you have the lid on?
E: Yes! Ever since...since I left your house. I mean, it was there when I went to bed.
E: I'm thinking, maybe they don't last. They're only there for a little bit and then they're gone.
VICTOR: Gasp No!    Sparky! Gasp
VICTOR (O.S.): Sparky!
VICTOR: Oh! Don't worry. I can fix that too.
VICTOR: Good night, boy.
BOB: Are you sure this is going to work?
TOSHIAKI: No. That's why it's called an experiment. We have to collect data. Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   38
BOB: Do we have to collect it on me?
TOSHIAKI: Ready?
BOB: No.
TOSHIAKI: Ten.    Nine.    Eight.
BOB: We could use a test dummy or something.
TOSHIAKI: Seven.    Six.    Five.
BOB: Computer simulation.
TOSHIAKI: Four.    Three.    Two.
BOB: I have to pee.
TOSHIAKI: One.
BOB: Whoah, woah, w-w-w-woah woah, whoah, woah, woah, woah.
BOB: (incredulous) It's working. It's working! Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   39
BOB: Painful murmurs
BOB: Scream
BOB'S MOTHER: What were you boys doing on the roof!?
BOB AND TOSHIAKI: Science.
BURGEMEISTER: As mayor of New Holland, you have entrusted me with your safety. So I can't sit idly by while a teacher endangers our children.
BOB'S MOTHER: The man is a menace!
ANOTHER FATHER: Have you looked through this "science" book they're using? Apparently, Pluto isn't good enough to be a planet anymore.
(MORE): Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   40
ANOTHER FATHER (CONT'D): When I was a kid, Pluto was a great planet. This guy comes along and rewrites the rules.
MOM: In fairness, he didn't write the textbook.
DAD: Mr Mayor, Edward Frankenstein, your neighbour of course. I would just like to say that our son Victor is just crazy about the new teacher. Thinks he's great.
ANOTHER MOTHER: My Cynthia has been asking all sorts of strange questions. About things I've never even heard of!
DAD: Shouldn't we at least give the man the chance to explain himself?
BURGEMEISTER: Yes. Please come up. Mr...Menace.
MR. RZYKRUSKI: Ladies, Gentlemen. I think the confusion here is that you are all very ignorant.
MR. RZYKRUSKI: Is this right word, "ignorant?"    I mean simple. Primitive. Unenlightened.
MR. RZYKRUSKI: You do not understand science, so you are afraid of it. Like a dog is afraid of thunder, or balloons. To you, science is magic and witchcraft because you have such small minds.
(MORE): Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2     41
MR. RZYKRUSKI (CONT'D): I cannot make your heads bigger, but your children's heads -- I can take them and crack them open. This is what I try to do. To get at their brains.
MOM: Oh my!
MR. RZYKRUSKI: Thank you.
DAD: Oh, geeze.
VICTOR: Be quick, boy. They'll be home any minute.
VICTOR: No no no no! Ssssh!
ELSA: Victor? Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   42
ELSA: Victor?
VICTOR: Hi, Elsa.    What are you doing?
ELSA: Practicing my song for Dutch Day.
VICTOR: It's nice.
ELSA: Did you get a new dog?
VICTOR: No.
ELSA: I heard a bark.
VICTOR: Yeah that was me.
ELSA: You were barking.
VICTOR: Victor pretends to bark and howl
ELSA: You must really miss Sparky.
VICTOR: I got to go.   Bye.
ELSA: Bye.
ELSA: I feel so sad for him, Persephone. He really misses his dog. Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2    43
VICTOR: Where's Mr. Rzykruski?
GYM TEACHER: All I know is, I'll be teaching the class for the rest of the semester.
ELSA: Do you know anything about science?
GYM TEACHER: I know more than you do.
BOB: Mr. Rzykruski knew a lot.
GYM TEACHER: Well, sometimes knowing too much is the problem.
VICTOR: What about the science fair?
GYM TEACHER: Oh, it's still on. But it will be judged by someone who is not insane -- Me!
GYM TEACHER: Now get cracking and may the best person win. Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2    44
VICTOR: I can't believe they let the gym teacher be the judge. She's not even interested in science.
MR. RZYKRUSKI: Back home, everyone is scientist. Even my plumber wins Nobel Prize. Your country does not make enough scientists. Always needs more. You should be a scientist, Victor.
VICTOR: Nobody likes scientists.
MR. RZYKRUSKI: They like what science gives them, but not the questions, no, not the questions that science asks.
VICTOR: Actually I have a question.
MR. RZYKRUSKI: That is why you are scientist.
VICTOR: I was doing my experiment, my project, and the first time it worked great. But the next time it didn't. I mean, it sort of worked, but then it didn't. And I don't know why.
MR. RZYKRUSKI: Then maybe you never really understood it the first time.
MR. RZYKRUSKI: People think science is here... (points to his head) ...but it is also here.
(MORE): Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   45
MR. RZYKRUSKI (CONT'D): (points to his heart). The first time, did you love your experiment?
VICTOR (V.O.): Yes.
MR. RZYKRUSKI (V.O.): And the second time?
VICTOR (V.O.): No.    I just wanted it over.
MR. RZYKRUSKI: Then you changed the variables.
VICTOR: I was doing it for the wrong reason.
MR. RZYKRUSKI: Science is not good or bad, Victor. But it can be used both ways. That is why you must always be careful.
BOB: I can't believe I broke my arm for nothing. None of us are going to win. E has an invisible fish. Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2    46
NASSOR: No he doesn't. You fell for a parlor trick.
TOSHIAKI: You're saying he faked it?
TOSHIAKI: That fish you showed us, was it real?
E: It was!   And it was dead, too.
NASSOR: You brought an animal back from the dead?
E: No, Victor did. With lightning and BOOM! and SSS...
TOSHIAKI: Impossible.
E: I swear! I mean, he already brought back his dog.
TOSHIAKI: He brought back Sparky?
TOSHIAKI: Hmmmm.
NASSOR: Victor will win the science fair. Unless we can do better. Bigger. Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   47
TOSHIAKI: You say you know Victor's secret. Now is your chance to prove it.
MOM: Now, where is my muffin tin?
MOM: (realizing) Victor.
MOM: Sparky?
MOM: Sparky? ... Sparky's alive!
DAD: Sparky! Hey. Come on.
VICTOR: Mom! Dad! What's going on?
VICTOR: Sparky! Nooooo! Sparky!
VICTOR: Sparky! No! Sparky come back! Sparky!
DAD: Hey! Hey! Just a minute.
VICTOR: No I have to go and find Sparky.
DAD: Victor what have you done?
VICTOR: You said yourself: If you could bring back Sparky, you would.
DAD: Yes, but that was different, because we couldn't! It's easy to promise the impossible. What you did was a very serious thing. Crossing the boundary between life and death -- reanimating a corpse -- it's very...upsetting. Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   49
VICTOR: I just wanted my dog back.
MOM: Oh sweetheart, we'll help you look for Sparky but when we get back I think we need to have a little talk. Understood.
VICTOR: Yes.
DAD: Now lets go find your dog.
VICTOR: Sparky? Are you in there!
VICTOR: Mom! Dad! I'm going to check out the school and the park, you guys do the town square, ok?
DAD: Got it.
MOM: Sparky! Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   50
DAD: Sparky!
BOB: Cool.
TOSHIAKI: Interesting.
E: It has something to do with the lightning. I don't really understand it.
TOSHIAKI: Ah-but I do.
NASSOR: Tonight, we shall bring the dead to life.
VICTOR: Sparky!    Where are you? Sparky! Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   51
MOM: Sparky? Sparky?
BURGEMEISTER: Thank you, thank you so much. And now, it's my pleasure to introduce this year's Little Dutch Girl, my niece, Elsa Van Helsing.
ELSA: I don't think this is safe.
BURGEMEISTER: Nonsense. We have the fire chief over here.
BURGEMEISTER: You know, a lot of girls would kill to be in your place. Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2     52
ELSA: I'd welcome death.

VICTOR: Come on boy.
VICTOR: Was someone else here?
BOB: Victor! I need your help.
VICTOR: Did you see those things? They were like....
BOB: Sea Monkeys. You know how on the package, they're like in a happy kingdom and everyone's smiling?
VICTOR: Yeah.
BOB: They're not like that at all.
TOSHIAKI: Victor!     I need your help!
BOB: I asked him first!
TOSHIAKI: My problem's bigger!
BOB: Yeah.    He's right.
VICTOR: Ok let's go!
BURGEMEISTER: And now for our next act we have something really big.
BURGEMEISTER: (panicked gasp)
BURGEMEISTER: Gasp

MOM: This way! In here.
