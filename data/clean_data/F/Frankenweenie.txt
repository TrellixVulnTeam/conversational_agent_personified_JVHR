FRANKENWEENIE: Written by John August
STARRING SPARKY: In 3D honey.
DAD: In 3D honey.
MOM: So that's where my candlestick Oh, isn't that your grandmother's table cloth.
DAD: Oh, isn't that your grandmother's table cloth.
MOM: That looks great!
DAD: Oh that is so.Woah! I just felt I was attacked.
MOM: Oh. That's scary.
DAD: Send in the marines!
ARMY FIGURE: Over here men. This way.
MOM: Oh! Watch out!
DAD: ENTER SPARKYSAURUS Sparky barks as he sees himself in the movie.
ENTER SPARKYSAURUS: Sparky that's you!
MOM: Sparky that's you!
DAD: Sparky that's you!
MOM: You tell em' Sparky.
DAD: You tell em' Sparky.
DAD: Suddenly, one of the projectors JAMS on a splice. The film melts, then the tail WHIPS AROUND, getting snared in the second projector's reel. The two machines SMASH TOGETHER in a shower of sparks.
MOM: Oh! Oh!
DAD: Um. Maybe just unplug it. Well it certainly was exciting!
MOM: Well it certainly was exciting!
DAD: Yeah, it was a big finish. Well done son.
VICTOR: I can fix this. C'mon boy!
DAD: See you later, sweetie.
MOM: Have a good day!
MOM: Victor! Come on honey your going to be late. Go put Sparky in the Come on Sparky!
VICTOR: Come on Sparky!
VICTOR: Good morning, Mr. Burgemeister!
BURGEMEISTER: Your dog has been sniffing around my Dutch Dazzlers. The other day I caught him peeing on my I'll keep an eye on him.
VICTOR: I'll keep an eye on him.
BURGEMEISTER: You better.
VICTOR: Yes sir.
VICTOR: Go on Sparky. That's right. Good
VICTOR: See you later!
BURGEMEISTER: Where do you think you're going?
ELSA: He turns to face her.
BURGEMEISTER: Is that so. What about that dog of She's not in the house and she's away from your tulips.
ELSA: She's not in the house and she's away from your tulips.
BURGEMEISTER: I want you to remember something, while your parents are away I am in charge here.
ELSA: Yes, Uncle Bob.
BURGEMEISTER: Dutch Day is coming up and I don't need any trouble. How's your song Keep at it. Dutch day is a big day for me.
ELSA: Keep at it. Dutch day is a big day for me.
BURGEMEISTER: Keep at it. Dutch day is a big day for me.
ELSA: Yes sir.
MR. RZYKRUSKI: Good morning children. I am Mr. Rzykruski. I will be your new science teacher. Apparently, Mr. Holcum had an incident.
E: He got hit by lightning.
MR. RZYKRUSKI: Well. That is bad. But he did not get "hit by" lightning. Lightning does not hit a person, the way one is hit by a baseball or a cabbage.
MR. RZYKRUSKI: Lightning is simply electricity. The cloud is angry, yes, making storm. All the electrons are saying, "I am leaving you. I go to land of opportunity."
MR. RZYKRUSKI: The ground says, "Yes, we need electrons trained in science just like you. Come! Come! Welcome!" So both sides start to build a This man, he comes out to look at the storm. He does not see the invisible ladders. When the two ladders meet, BOOM! The circuit is complete and all of the electrons rush to the land of opportunity. This man is in the way. Yiii!
MR. RZYKRUSKI: But is very rare to have such
TOSHIAKI: But it's not rare. Lightning happens to people all the time here. There's a thunderstorm almost every night.
BOB: My dad got hit twice.
WEIRD GIRL: They built New Holland on an abandoned gold mine.
TOSHIAKI: I heard it was a cemetery.
WEIRD GIRL: That's where they buried the It's the windmill that does it.
NASSOR: It's the windmill that does it.
NASSOR: Turning, turning the air until the sky itself rages against the
WEIRD GIRL: No. Cemetery. Definitely.
MR. RZYKRUSKI: Students on your way out, take a permission slip for the Science
BOB: ( per the form ) First prize is a huge trophy! Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2 10
WEIRD GIRL: Hello, Victor.
VICTOR: WEIRD GIRL
WEIRD GIRL: Mr. Whiskers had a dream about you last night.
VICTOR: How do you know?
WEIRD GIRL: Because this morning, he made
VICTOR: Did you get that out of the litter It's an omen.
WEIRD GIRL: It's an omen.
WEIRD GIRL: If Mr. Whiskers dreams about you, it means something big is going to
VICTOR: You can keep it.
WEIRD GIRL: One day you'll dream about me, won't you kitty?
VICTOR: Hey boy. How you doing?
E: You'll be my partner, right,
VICTOR: It says no death rays. See?
E: Ah, man. I still want to do it. C'mon. Who else would be your partner? You don't have friends and neither do I.
VICTOR: I'm sorry Edgar. I just don't need a partner. I like to work alone.
VICTOR: Will you sign my permission slip?
MOM: Dinner's ready.
DAD: Victor, have I ever talked to you about what I do for a living?
VICTOR: You're a travel agent.
DAD: I sell dreams. I tell people, you can sail to Italy. You can do the hula in Hawaii.
VICTOR: Will you sign my form?
DAD: I'm getting to that.
VICTOR: Dad picks up two long fondue forks, using them to illustrate his point.
DAD: In my job, sometimes you have people who don't want quite the same thing, right. Say the husband wants to play golf in Scotland, but the wife wants to paddle down the Amazon. Alright you've got two conflicting ideas And it's my job, Victor, to help them meet halfway. Say, Scottsdale, Arizona. He gets to golf, she gets Indians.
MOM: But there's no river. And no Nobody gets what they want.
VICTOR: Nobody gets what they want.
DAD: Exactly. And wrong. They both get what they want because they
DAD: You'd like to do this science fair. And that's great. I'd like you to try a sport. Say, I don't know, baseball. Science fair, baseball. Science fair, baseball. How do you choose? Guess what? You don't have to. No reason you can't do both. You meet in the Everyone's happy.
DAD: Look at what Toshiaki's doing. Keeping his eye on the target. Never losing his concentration.
GYM TEACHER: Strike three! Next Batter!
MR. RZYKRUSKI: I want you to concentrate on your project for the science fair.
MOM: Come on honey!
TOSHIAKI: Nice catch Sparky.
DAD: Come on Victor, please. Tie Sparky up and get your head into the Time out!
GYM TEACHER: Time out!
VICTOR: Sorry boy.
ELSA: Hey Sparky.
GYM TEACHER: Play ball.
GYM TEACHER: Strike One.
DAD: Nice try son.
MR. RZYKRUSKI: When conducting an experiment, trying is the important thing. It is OK to fail as long as you keep
MOM: Come on Victor- you can do it!
GYM TEACHER: Strike two!
TOSHIAKI: Come on honey!
MOM: Come on honey!
MOM: Oh Sparky!
A CAR: SCREECHES up at him. Sparky reacts. We CUT AWAY as the car hits.
VICTOR: Sparky! Noooooo!
MOM: He was a great dog. A great The best dog a kid could have.
DAD: The best dog a kid could have.
MOM: When you lose someone you love, they never really leave you. They just move into a special place in your heart. He'll always be there, Victor.
VICTOR: I don't want him in my heart. I want him here, with me.
MOM: I know. If we could bring him back, we would.
MOM: Try and get some sleep sweet heart- things will seem better in the
MR. RZYKRUSKI: Just like lightning, the nervous system is electricity.
CHILDREN: MR. RZYKRUSKI
MR. RZYKRUSKI: Even after death, the wiring remains. Watch as the muscles respond to the electricity.
MOM: Hi Victor, how was school?
VICTOR: Victor heads upstairs with a box of the appliances he has just collected.
CRACK!: A jagged finger of light touches the top of the balloons, racing down the cord and into the attic - Zapping Sparky with a thousand volts. Victor removes his goggles, and springs right to action cranking down the metal table, eager to see if it worked. All of the appliances power down and grind to a halt. The room goes silent. He swings the table over to the workbench. Wearing a stethoscope, he listens for a heartbeat. Hearing nothing, he keeps checking. But he eventually realizes it has all been for naught. He lays his head down on the workbench, letting out exhausted, sniffly tears.
VICTOR: I'm sorry, boy.
VICTOR: You're alive! You're alive! Sparky! You're Alive! I can't believe it you're alive! I can fix that.
VICTOR: I can fix that.
VICTOR: It worked. It really worked.
MOM: Victor! Breakfast!
MOM: Victor? Are you up here?
VICTOR: Ssssh! Quiet down boy! Ssssh!
VICTOR: Sparky! Sssh! Quiet.
MOM: French toast or waffles?
VICTOR: Then I'll need my waffle iron back, Mr. Director.
MOM: Then I'll need my waffle iron back, Mr. Director.
VICTOR: It's my science project. It's a A robotic bucket?
MOM: A robotic bucket?
VICTOR: For mopping, I suppose.
MOM: For mopping, I suppose.
VICTOR: Then maybe when you're finished, you'll let me use it. Sorry, boy, but I can't let anyone know about you. They may not understand. So you need to stay here today.
MOM: Then maybe when you're finished, you'll let me use it. Sorry, boy, but I can't let anyone know about you. They may not understand. So you need to stay here today.
VICTOR: Sorry, boy, but I can't let anyone know about you. They may not understand. So you need to stay here today.
BURGEMEISTER: Watch it, there! I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
VICTOR: I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
MOM: No. Couldn't be.
BOB'S MOTHER: What! screams
FIRST WOMAN: I know, and Helen said she thought he was putting up some kind of tv antenna on top of the roof!
SECOND WOMAN: In the middle of a thunderstorm?
FIRST WOMAN: That's what she said!
SECOND MOTHER: And did you get that big power surge in the night? Jack thought it was a fuse box but apparently it effected the whole
FIRST WOMAN: Sweetie are you ok? Here you go.
SECOND MOTHER: So anyway Jack loves it here but if the schools weren't so great sometimes I wonder if we would be better of.
E: Sparky stops short and looks right at E before running off home. E's eyes narrow. Isn't Sparky supposed to be dead? We end on a shot of E, hatching a plan.
ZAPPED!: The force of the spark sends Sparky back through the fence and into his own yard. Persephone is thrown clear across her garden. As she woozily gets back up, she turns and we see that she now has a Bride of Frankenstein stripe in her hair!
MOM: Hi Victor. How was school?
VICTOR: He's heads up the stairs just as Sparky walks through the front door, following a few steps behind.
VICTOR: Hearing no answer, he walks in further. He checks behind the curtain.
VICTOR: Slight panic creeps into Victor's voice before Sparky sneaks in behind him and nudges his leg.
VICTOR: There you are. Good boy!
VICTOR: Sorry you had to stay here alone all day.
VICTOR: What's the matter boy? Are you ok? Hmmm. You're a little low. Are you hungry, boy?
VICTOR: Alright, here lets top you up.
MOM: Victor your friend is here.
VICTOR: Edgar. What are you doing here?
E: Edgar. What are you doing here?
VICTOR: Edgar. What are you doing here?
E: I know.
VICTOR: I know.
E: I know.
VICTOR: Know what?
E: You know.
VICTOR: I think I know what you know I Look, I don't know what you think I know, but I don't know it.
E: I think I know what you know I Look, I don't know what you think I know, but I don't know it.
VICTOR: Look, I don't know what you think I know, but I don't know it.
E: Your dog is alive.
VICTOR: That's impossible.
E: I know. I know it is so impossible but you did it. You did it.
E: So show me how, or I'll tell everyone. Oh Mrs Frankenstein.
VICTOR: Mom comes back into the kitchen.
E: .. May I have a cookie please?
MOM: Oh- yes. Of course.
VICTOR: Alright. Come on.
VICTOR: I think the wind and the lightning are part of the same thing, some kind of strange force. But the wind isn't strong enough to bring an animal back from the dead. For that, you need lightning.
E: So when can I do it?
VICTOR: You can't. This isn't an experiment. It's my dog.
E: Show and tell Victor: you show me and I won't tell.
E: I'd like to buy a fish.
E: This one.
E: What do we do now?
E: What happened to it? What did you I don't know. It should have
VICTOR: I don't know. It should have
VICTOR: ( in wonderment ) It's invisible. It's an invisible Why is it invisible?
E: Why is it invisible?
VICTOR: I have no idea.
VICTOR: You can't tell anyone. You understand that, right? Not until we figure out how it works.
E: Okay! Okay!
VICTOR: We see E crossing his fingers behind his back.
E: We see E crossing his fingers behind his back.
TOSHIAKI: How are we supposed to see an invisible goldfish?
E: Put your finger in. You can feel
BOB: He yanks his finger out.
BOB: It bit me.
TOSHIAKI: Let me see it.
GASP: Toshiaki turns off the lamp and takes a closer look at the jar. E takes the jar back. Screws on the lid.
E: It's my science project and it's top secret. Yeah, well, our science fair project is even cooler.
BOB: Yeah, well, our science fair project is even cooler.
E: What is it?
TOSHIAKI: Double top secret.
BOB: Sea monkeys. We gotta come up with something better. Bigger.
TOSHIAKI: I know.
BOB: The science fair is in two days!
TOSHIAKI: I know.
BOB: You're the smart one.
TOSHIAKI: I know!
VICTOR: Ok, ok, sit still. Ssssh! Sparky. No! Sssh. No! Sssh.
VICTOR: Sorry, boy. But we can't risk anyone seeing you again.
VICTOR: Sparky lies down, head on his paws, sad and lonely.
NASSOR: Toshiaki says you have an invisible fish.
E: No he doesn't.
NASSOR: So you don't?
E: I didn't say that. Who said I Toshiaki says it's your science fair project.
NASSOR: Toshiaki says it's your science fair project.
E: If it was, I couldn't tell you.
NASSOR: So it isn't? Or it is?
E: No. Yes. I'm confused.
NASSOR: Do you have an invisible fish?
E: Okay. But you have to keep it a
E: Swish your finger around. You can feel it.
NASSOR: It's just water. There's nothing No, it's invisible?
E: No, it's invisible?
E: January 2012
NASSOR: I don't know what kind of game you and Victor are playing. But that trophy will be mine!
E: A beat.
E: Victor! Something's wrong with my What is it?
VICTOR: What is it?
E: It's not there anymore.
VICTOR: Maybe it just hopped out. Did you have the lid on?
E: Yes! Ever since.since I left your house. I mean, it was there when I went to bed.
E: I'm thinking, maybe they don't last. They're only there for a little bit and then they're gone.
VICTOR: Gasp No! Sparky! Gasp
VICTOR: Oh! Don't worry. I can fix that
VICTOR: Good night, boy.
BOB: Are you sure this is going to
TOSHIAKI: No. That's why it's called an experiment. We have to collect
BOB: Do we have to collect it on me?
TOSHIAKI: Ten. Nine. Eight.
BOB: Ten. Nine. Eight.
TOSHIAKI: Ten. Nine. Eight.
BOB: We could use a test dummy or Seven. Six. Five.
TOSHIAKI: Seven. Six. Five.
BOB: Computer simulation.
TOSHIAKI: Four. Three. Two.
BOB: I have to pee.
TOSHIAKI: Toshiaki yanks the cord. The soda BLASTS out the bottom of the jet-pack. Toshiaki grabs his video camera to document their Bob finds himself hovering in fits and starts and actually gets a bit airborne.
BOB: Whoah, woah, w-w-w-woah woah, whoah, woah, woah, woah.
BOB: ( incredulous ) It's working. It's working!
BOB: Painful murmurs
BOB: EXT. HOUSE - DAY A half-dozen NEIGHBORS and classmates have gathered to watch as Bob is loaded into an ambulance. His arm is already in a sling. BOB'S MOTHER is apoplectic:
BOB'S MOTHER: What were you boys doing on the
BURGEMEISTER: As mayor of New Holland, you have entrusted me with your safety. So I can't sit idly by while a teacher endangers our children.
BOB'S MOTHER: The man is a menace!
ANOTHER FATHER: Have you looked through this "science" book they're using? Apparently, Pluto isn't good enough to be a planet anymore.
MOM: In fairness, he didn't write the Mr Mayor, Edward Frankenstein, your neighbour of course. I would just like to say that our son Victor is just crazy about the new teacher. Thinks he's great.
DAD: Mr Mayor, Edward Frankenstein, your neighbour of course. I would just like to say that our son Victor is just crazy about the new teacher. Thinks he's great.
ANOTHER MOTHER: My Cynthia has been asking all sorts of strange questions. About things I've never even heard of!
DAD: Shouldn't we at least give the man the chance to explain himself?
BURGEMEISTER: Yes. Please come up.
MR. RZYKRUSKI: Ladies, Gentlemen. I think the confusion here is that you are all very ignorant.
MR. RZYKRUSKI: Is this right word, "ignorant?" I mean simple. Primitive.
MR. RZYKRUSKI: You do not understand science, so you are afraid of it. Like a dog is afraid of thunder, or balloons. To you, science is magic and witchcraft because you have such small minds.
MOM: Oh my!
MR. RZYKRUSKI: Thank you.
DAD: Oh, geeze.
VICTOR: Be quick, boy. They'll be home any minute.
VICTOR: No no no no! Ssssh!
ELSA: January 2012
ELSA: Hi, Elsa. What are you doing?
VICTOR: Hi, Elsa. What are you doing?
ELSA: Practicing my song for Dutch Day.
VICTOR: It's nice.
ELSA: Did you get a new dog?
VICTOR: I heard a bark.
ELSA: I heard a bark.
VICTOR: Yeah that was me.
ELSA: You were barking.
VICTOR: Victor pretends to bark and howl
ELSA: You must really miss Sparky. I got to go. Bye.
VICTOR: I got to go. Bye.
ELSA: Elsa kneels down and pets Persephone lovingly.
ELSA: I feel so sad for him, Persephone. He really misses his dog.
VICTOR: Where's Mr. Rzykruski?
GYM TEACHER: All I know is, I'll be teaching the class for the rest of the
ELSA: Do you know anything about I know more than you do.
GYM TEACHER: I know more than you do.
BOB: Mr. Rzykruski knew a lot.
GYM TEACHER: Well, sometimes knowing too much is the problem.
VICTOR: What about the science fair?
GYM TEACHER: Oh, it's still on. But it will be judged by someone who is not insane Me!
GYM TEACHER: Now get cracking and may the best person win.
VICTOR: I can't believe they let the gym teacher be the judge. She's not even interested in science.
MR. RZYKRUSKI: Back home, everyone is scientist. Even my plumber wins Nobel Prize. Your country does not make enough scientists. Always needs more. You should be a scientist, Victor.
VICTOR: Nobody likes scientists.
MR. RZYKRUSKI: They like what science gives them, but not the questions, no, not the questions that science asks.
VICTOR: Actually I have a question.
MR. RZYKRUSKI: That is why you are scientist.
VICTOR: I was doing my experiment, my project, and the first time it worked great. But the next time it didn't. I mean, it sort of worked, but then it didn't. And I don't know why.
MR. RZYKRUSKI: Then maybe you never really understood it the first time.
MR. RZYKRUSKI: People think science is here. .but it is also here.
MR. RZYKRUSKI: Then you changed the variables.
VICTOR: I was doing it for the wrong Science is not good or bad, Victor. But it can be used both ways. That is why you must always be careful.
MR. RZYKRUSKI: Science is not good or bad, Victor. But it can be used both ways. That is why you must always be careful.
BOB: I can't believe I broke my arm for nothing. None of us are going to win. E has an invisible fish.
NASSOR: No he doesn't. You fell for a parlor trick.
TOSHIAKI: You're saying he faked it?
E: That fish you showed us, was it It was! And it was dead, too.
GASP: That fish you showed us, was it It was! And it was dead, too.
TOSHIAKI: That fish you showed us, was it It was! And it was dead, too.
E: It was! And it was dead, too.
NASSOR: You brought an animal back from the dead? No, Victor did. With lightning and BOOM! and SSS.
E: No, Victor did. With lightning and BOOM! and SSS.
TOSHIAKI: I swear! I mean, he already brought back his dog. He brought back Sparky?
E: I swear! I mean, he already brought back his dog. He brought back Sparky?
TOSHIAKI: He brought back Sparky?
TOSHIAKI: Victor will win the science fair. Unless we can do better. Bigger.
NASSOR: Victor will win the science fair. Unless we can do better. Bigger.
TOSHIAKI: You say you know Victor's secret. Now is your chance to prove it.
MOM: Now, where is my muffin tin?
MOM: ( realizing )
MOM: Sparky walks around the curtain and stands panting next to Mom. She turns, startled and sees - Sparky. His NECK BOLTS. His STITCHES. Mom falls backwards and onto the floor and -
MOM: Sparky? . Sparky's alive!
DAD: Sparky! Hey. Come on.
VICTOR: Mom! Dad! What's going on?
VICTOR: Sparky! Nooooo! Sparky!
VICTOR: Sparky! No! Sparky come back!
DAD: Hey! Hey! Just a minute.
VICTOR: No I have to go and find Sparky.
DAD: Victor what have you done?
VICTOR: You said yourself: If you could bring back Sparky, you would.
DAD: Yes, but that was different, because we couldn't! It's easy to promise the impossible. What you did was a very serious thing. Crossing the boundary between life and death reanimating a corpse it's
VICTOR: I just wanted my dog back.
MOM: Oh sweetheart, we'll help you look for Sparky but when we get back I think we need to have a little talk. Understood.
VICTOR: Mom and Dad share a look.
DAD: Now lets go find your dog.
VICTOR: Sparky? Are you in there!
VICTOR: Mom! Dad! I'm going to check out the school and the park, you guys do the town square, ok?
DAD: Got it.
MOM: January 2012
DAD: As they go in their respective directions we see Toshiaki, Edgar, Nassor and Weird Girl skulking in the Toshiaki nudges Edgar forward and motions to the front door which has been left ajar in their haste.
BOB: Nassor and Weird Girl check out the equipment - pushing and pulling on the wires with clumsy curiosity. Edgar tries to confer with Toshiaki who turns his back dismissively. Its clear there are no more partnerships. Its every man for himself. Toshiaki examines the formulas and theorems on the
TOSHIAKI: It has something to do with the lightning. I don't really understand it.
E: It has something to do with the lightning. I don't really understand it.
TOSHIAKI: Ah-but I do.
NASSOR: Tonight, we shall bring the dead to life.
VICTOR: Sparky! Where are you? Sparky!
MOM: Sparky? Sparky? Thank you, thank you so much. And now, it's my pleasure to introduce this year's Little Dutch Girl, my niece, Elsa Van Helsing.
BURGEMEISTER: Thank you, thank you so much. And now, it's my pleasure to introduce this year's Little Dutch Girl, my niece, Elsa Van Helsing.
ELSA: I don't think this is safe.
BURGEMEISTER: Nonsense. We have the fire chief over here.
BURGEMEISTER: You know, a lot of girls would kill to be in your place.
ELSA: I'd welcome death.
ELSA: ( singing ) Praise be New Holland, Streets so wide and sidewalks clean, Modest homes at modest prices, Everyone's urban dream, Praise be New Holland, Happy children free from tears, Free from all the worlds dangers, Free from crime and free from strangers,
ELSA: ( singing ) In our houses tight and safe, We have nothing to fear,
NASSOR: Ah. The tomb of Collosus soon you shall be awakened and we shall be reunited once again.
TOSHIAKI: EXT. SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS E rummages in the school garbage cans and triumphantly pulls out a dead rat.
ELSA: ( singing ) Praise be New Holland, May your windmill spin forever more.
MR. BURGEMEISTER: Isn't she adorable.
WEIRD GIRL: Mr Whiskers?
WEIRD GIRL: Mr Whiskers?
WEIRD GIRL: Mr Whiskers.
GYM TEACHER: Hello? Is someone there?
NASSOR: Rise, colossus. Rise from your
TOSHIAKI: Suddenly, a massive turtle foot SMASHES down, crushing the shed. A GIANT TURTLE MONSTER bigger than a bus SHRIEKS to the heavens. Toshiaki scrambles to get away, alternately impressed and The turtle opens its mouth, and lets out a blood curdling roar. Distracted by the Dutch Day lights the Turtle monster heads to town.
VICTOR: Sparky? Sparky?
VICTOR: Sparky peers around the edge of the tombstone and realizes that it's Victor and hangs his head in shame.
VICTOR: Sparky is nervous and confused but slowly rests his head in Victor's arms.
VICTOR: Sparky it's OK boy, it's just me. I thought that you were gone. I never want to lose you. Promise you'll never go running off. Okay?
VICTOR: Come on boy.
VICTOR: Was someone else here?
BOB: Victor! I need your help.
VICTOR: Did you see those things? They were like..
BOB: Sea Monkeys. You know how on the package, they're like in a happy kingdom and everyone's smiling?
VICTOR: They're not like that at all.
BOB: They're not like that at all.
TOSHIAKI: Victor! I need your help!
BOB: I asked him first!
TOSHIAKI: My problem's bigger!
BOB: Yeah. He's right.
VICTOR: Ok let's go!
BURGEMEISTER: And now for our next act we have something really big.
BURGEMEISTER: ( panicked gasp )
BURGEMEISTER: GYM TEACHER
GYM TEACHER: Screams No get away.
MOM: This way! In here.
DAD: Suddenly another sea monkey smashes into the glass followed by another and then another. Mom and Dad are surrounded. Just as it appears they are going to be overwhelmed - THE TURTLE MONSTER arrives. His huge hand bears down on the phone box ripping it from the ground. Mom and Dad make their move and run to find safety as the turtle monster chomps down on the phone box and the sea monkeys scurry off.
NASSOR: Go Colossus! Kill! Kill! Kill!
NASSOR: The angry turtle roars in Nassor's face knocking him clear across the square. Nassor flies with such velocity that he gets tangled up in the banners and bunting that festoon the street and he lands in an upright display of Russian nesting dolls. As he smashes into the case we see that now he too is wrapped up like a mummy. His scowling eyes are all that is visible as the lid closes like a sarcophagus and collapses to the ground.
E: Ah! Get away from me! Get away from me! Ah!
VICTOR: Your sea monkeys, were they freshwater or saltwater?
BOB: Freshwater animals can't tolerate
VICTOR: Freshwater animals can't tolerate
VICTOR: Hey over here!
BOB: Bob haughtily celebrates a little too quickly and gets completely drenched in pop corn goop
ELSA: Elsa is using a stick to fight him off but the stick breaks in half and the Wererat seems ready to pounce. E is no help at all and takes this moment to for his life leaving Elsa and Persephone completely helpless.
ELSA: Get back! Stay away from us!
VICTOR: Victor races over to make sure Sparky is not hurt and suddenly they hear an almighty roar -
TOSHIAKI: The turtle monster grabs Toshiaki by the pants and lifts him up into the air.
TOSHIAKI: No, no, no! Stop you put me down- I gave you life!
TOSHIAKI: Victor! Victor I need help please.
TOSHIAKI: ( solemnly )
ELSA: Persephone, are you ok? Here Mr Whiskers! Here kitty kitty Mr Whiskers.
WEIRD GIRL: Here Mr Whiskers! Here kitty kitty Mr Whiskers.
ELSA: Elsa races after her dog, dropping her hat and wig in her Victor hears Elsa's screams and goes after her. The Weird Girl is still dazed and confused, still calling for her kitty.
ELSA: Peresphone! Help! Bring her back.
WEIRD GIRL: Mr Whiskers?
VICTOR: I'm coming Elsa!
BURGEMEISTER: What happened?
DAD: Sparky! There you are!
MOM: Are you alright?
DAD: What you got there boy?
BURGEMEISTER: I knew it! It's the boys dead dog!
BURGEMEISTER: That's Elsa's wig! Where's my He's killed the little girl!
BOB'S MOTHER: He's killed the little girl!
BURGEMEISTER: After him kill the monster!
ELSA: Help! Stay away from us.
BURGEMEISTER: Get him!
BURGEMEISTER: Where's my niece?
TOWNSFOLK 1: Look out it's on fire!
BOB'S MOM: It's Elsa!
ELSA: January 2012
BURGEMEISTER: The crowd recoils in horror and Sparky breaks free and runs into the burning windmill.
MOM: INT. WINDMILL - NIGHT Victor arrives at the top level of the windmill. Smoke and flames are rising.
