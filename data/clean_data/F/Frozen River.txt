RAY: Hey, you can lose the attitude. Anyway, Kmart was closed by the time I got off
RAY: I told you to be careful with the microwave, didn't I?
LILA: She opens the door, but no one is there. At her feet she sees a Pringles can. In it: the cash she left at her mother-in-law's house for her son. She looks towards the woods but there is no sign of anyone. She shuts the door. Inside she digs through an old box of junk and pulls out a 2 foot long oval shaped wooden board, an infant board, and a blanket. She wraps her pillow in the blanket around the board in the Mohawk tradition and picks it up. She tries it on her back, then leans it against the wall, then hangs it on a hook on the wall.
RICKY: Ricky runs to the door and opens it, then backs away. Trooper Napoli is there.
TROOPER NAPOLI: Is there a Ray Eddy here?

RAY: Wow. That's a shock.
TROOPER NAPOLI: Yes, well, there is that element on the Reservation I'm sure you know.
RAY: Yeah, I've heard about it but I didn't know she was involved.
TROOPER NAPOLI: How did you happen to meet her?
RAY: Uh, I think there was a sign for a baby sitter at the Wolf Mart. That's where I get my gas.
TROOPER NAPOLI: I just thought you should be aware of that. She's known to have smuggled illegal immigrants into the country.
RAY: Oh my God.
TROOPER NAPOLI: If I were you I'd find a new baby sitter. You don't want her around young kids.
RAY: He eyes the side of the trailer where smoke stained siding is visible.
TROOPER NAPOLI: Well, you have an enjoyable Holiday.
RAY: Thanks. You, too.

LILA: How many bedrooms?
RAY: Three. And it's got a jacuzzi tub in the master bathroom.
LILA: Wall to wall carpet?
RAY: Oh yeah. But the best thing is the insulation. The pipes can never freeze.
VERSAILLES: .what I think you'll find with the Commodore and you'll be the judge is that the vinyl wall covering is perfect for small children. There is never a need to repaint or even touch up-
RAY: I wanna schedule a delivery.
VERSAILLES: ( to the couple ) Give me just a second.
RAY: It's three thousand but I want it delivered tomorrow.
VERSAILLES: I told you all or nothing.
RAY: Take it as a deposit. All you have to do is show up. If I don't have the rest you keep it.
