JOHN'S POV: Rusted Ham radio antenna, half-fallen over. John scoots over to it, straightening it. But he slips, sliding down the roof, coming to rest against the chimney. A light pops on from an upstairs window across the street. Gordo appears in the window. Does a double take when he sees John, sitting on the roof, soaked, drunk.

GIBSON: Don't know what's behind it.
FRANK: One way to find out.
INTERCUT WITH: EXT. BUXTON WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS Fire fighters are efficiently and expertly hard at it. Running out lines. Extending ladders. Moving a FIRE BOAT into place - all communicating via walkie-talkies all on teh same frequency. The BIG LADDER is now in place. As it telescopes up, the ROOF MAN, BILL CAWLEY, begins his climb. PUMP TRUCKS and THE FIRE BOAT keep pumping water onto the blaze. But no matter. For the moment, this is one OUT OF

JOHNNY: I'm right here behind you.
FRANK: I'm right here behind you.
JOHNNY: Frank lets go. Johnny keeps pumping those little six-year old legs. A bit wobbly at first, but he's gonna make it. On Johnny's eyes: determination & self-confidence.

JOHNNY: I'm doing it! I'm doing it!

OVERHEAD SHOT: Johnny blissfully riding around Frank in a big gentle circle. Frank slowly spins around keeping his eyes on his Little INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT - 1998 John walks in the front door, takes off his coat. The house looks different. Cleaner, furnishings less ragged.

JOHN: Oh my God.
INFERNO": John turns, stares at the radio questioningly. He starts to sit down at the desk when he spots something on the front edge of it. WORDS CARVED INTO THE WOOD, 29 YEARS AGO by fire fighter Frank Sullivan. The day John saved his father's life: I'M STILL HERE CHIEF The last letter is missing. But then a patch of wood starts to morph - as if it were being carved by an invisible knife.
FRANK: Chief?! Is that you?
JOHN: Yeah, it's me.
FRANK: You're the voice of an angel, Johnny. If you hadn't told me, no way I would'a ever made it.

FRANK: So what should I do? Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
JOHN: They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad. You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.
FRANK: I don't know, John. I'm a fire fighter. This is.this is different.
JOHN: I do know. I'm a cop. This is what I
FRANK: What if the radio stops working? Christ, what if I can't reach you again?
JOHN: Then you get Mom the hell out. But Dad, those other women weren't supposed to die. We don't try to stop this guy, we're gonna live with that for the rest of our lives.
FRANK: What do I gotta do?
JOHN: The next victim was Karen Reynolds.It happens tomorrow. Case file says she left St. Vincents at six. Show'd up at Cozy's Bar around six thirty. She walked outta that bar around seven-thirty. They found her dead in an empty lot behind the place at eight
FRANK: Why not just get the cops to watch the They'll question her. Whatever they tell her could change what happens. No, I want you to follow her. See if anybody's watching her, hittin' on her. I'm betting somebody's gonna walk outta that bar with her. When they do, you call the cops.

WOMAN'S VOICE: Hey, Chuck.
BARTENDER: Hey, Karen.
YOUNG DETECTIVE: Is that really how you got the Son of Sam? Parking tickets?
SATCH: Any word on our bones?
YOUNG DETECTIVE: But how'd you think of it?
SATCH: You're pulling over with a .44 bulldog tucked in your pants getting ready to blow somebody's brains out.I figure the last thing you're thinking about is alternate side of the street parking.
JOHN: That's what we need here, Satch. A lucky That wasn't luck, Johnny boy. That was smarts and ten plus on the job.
SATCH: That wasn't luck, Johnny boy. That was smarts and ten plus on the job.
BARTENDER: From the girls, pal. All of 'em.
FRANK: I was, uh, I'm not really.
FRANK: ( noting wedding ring ) A married fireman.
FRANK: And Frank takes a seat, sliding in next to Karen. An awkward moment for him as she takes a closer look at his face.
KAREN: Do I know you?
FRANK: I don't think so.
KAREN: ( puts it together ) From the Korean market up the street. ( laughing ) Mr. Lee make you pay for those veggies.
FRANK: I follow fires, nothing else.
JOHN: ( grabbing the phone ) ( beat ) You're kiddin'. ( grabbing pen; scribbling )

JOHN: Dad, I think I may be able to get you enough information to make sure the DA can nail this bastard.
FRANK: Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli. Girl disappeared in '68. Turns out she was his first kill. Which means he probably knew her. Most serials know their first victim. I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together.

JOHN: Hey, Gordo. My name is Santa Clause. And I'm gonna give you the biggest Christmas present you ever had.

JOHN: I'm right here, Dad.
FRANK: You all right?
JOHN: Yeah, I think so.
FRANK: Don't worry, Chief. I'm not gonna let anything happen to her.no matter what.
CLOSE ON: a white vinyl DIARY with a blue heart shaped padlock held by a hand. A page is turned and the name ALAN SILVER comes RACK FOCUS TO an old Catholic High School yearbook on the dresser below the diary and a PICTURE of DARYL ADAMS, 18 years old.
JOHN'S VOICE: Can I keep these for a little while?
FINELLI: Detectives' been through that stuff already back then.
JOHN: John pulls a clear plastic BAG from his pocket with a patch of the partially disintegrated clothing found on Mary Finellis skeleton.
FINELLI: Mary volunteered over at St. Vincents' after school. She loved it.was going to become a doctor.
JOHN: Okay, lemme walk you through it.
SATCH: Mind if I shake it off first.so's I can concentrate better.
JOHN: Three guys show up in both the yearbook and diary.
JOHN: The third one is Daryl Adams.
SATCH: So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street. Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
JOHN: Not the first time that's been true. I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy. This is the guy, Satch.
SATCH: Uh, huh.
JOHN: I'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that Daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the
SATCH: I'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that Daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the
CLOSE ON: the 47-year old face of Daryl Adams. A notably unimposing guy. He is not a happy camper. He is one of two PLUMBERS installing fixtures in the kitchen of a new place. Several other people are at work getting the kitchen ready. So as not to be overheard.
DARYL: That was over thirty years ago. I paid for that and then some.
JOHN: You go to Xavier High School, Daryl?
DARYL: You remember Mary Finelli?
JOHN: You remember Mary Finelli?
DARYL: ( mentally steps back ) What are you saying?
JOHN: You know what I'm saying.
DARYL: No, I don't.
JOHN: Well, I think you do.
SISSY: Give me a couple Bloodys, Gus, and a Dewars on the rocks.
FRANK: Just fine. You?
SISSY: Right now, just fine. Ask me later,
JOHN: Sexual assault, Daryl. Five years. But you got lucky, right? You got away with something else. Something you figured nobody knows about.
DARYL: What I know is what I told you.
JOHN: Let me tell you what I know, Daryl. You went to Saint Xavier with Mary. You lived five blocks from her. You liked her. But she ain't interested. That must've hurt, huh?
DARYL: So what?
JOHN: So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?
DARYL: Satch can see this is going nowhere.
BARTENDER: You spare a smoke?
FRANK: I'm trying to quite. Turns out those things'll kill you.
DARYL: Oh, my God! What is that?! Why you showing me this shit!? JESUS! JESUS! Get those away from me!
JOHN: Nicky Moore. Patty Ryan. Mary Finelli. These names mean anything to you, asshole? Julia Sullivan! She mean anything? She means something to me!
WOMAN: You fight fires, honey?
FRANK: Yep. That's what I do.
WOMAN: I bet you do.
BARTENDER: Last call.
SATCH: I gotta take a leak. You need to use the head? You can, y'know. If you want to.
SISSY: See you, Fireman. Don't talk so much next time.
JOHN: You know, Daryl, sometimes, despite all the training we cops go through. Despite all that we are taught about right and wrong. Despite all that we would like to honor in ourselves, we can come to a place where we don't give a fuck. Know what I mean?
SATCH: John freezes. Looks towards Satch.
JOHN: Yeah. Sure.
SATCH: He ain't our guy, John.
JOHN: Just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer. Not everyone fits the profile.
SATCH: If he was gonna give something up he would'a done it already.
KILLER: You following me?
CLOSE ON: Killer's eyes, evil fuckin' black dots. He lifts Frank to his knees. Then rips a fist into Frank's face.
FRANK: ( barely able to speak ) Mary Finelli.
KILLER: Who the fuck are you?
KILLER: Yeah. He just needs a little time kissing the porcelain.
FRANK: OPEN UP, OPEN THE DOOR.ah.ummm.THIS
FRANK: He killed her John. He killed her and I didn't do a thing to stop it.
JOHN: It's not your fault, Dad.
FRANK: Yes it is.we did this. We changed I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die.in the fire. I was supposed to die in that warehouse.
JOHN: ANGLE ON Frank. Trembling, overcome by an awful combination of fear, guilt and shame.
ANGLE ON: Frank. Trembling, overcome by an awful combination of fear, guilt and shame.
FRANK: This is wrong.it's like we cheated.
JOHN: I know. But Dad, you can't go back. You didn't die in that fire. And no matter what you do, nothing is gonna change that. So all we can do is deal with this.and try to make it right.
FRANK: I don't think I can. I'm not a cop. I can't. I can't stop this guy.
JOHN: But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
FRANK: Johnny, I know, but.
JOHN: I need you to believe in me. To believe that we can do this.
FRANK: John, he's got my driver's license.
JOHN: He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
FRANK: He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
JOHN: He took your wallet?
FRANK: No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the He touched your wallet! Where's your In my pocket.

FRANK: His prints. You've got his prints. I'll run them through criminal index. You gotta get me that wallet.
JOHN: His prints. You've got his prints. I'll run them through criminal index. You gotta get me that wallet.
FRANK: How the hell am I gonna do that?
JOHN: ( thinks ) Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
FRANK: Please, Dad, just do it.
JOHN: Please, Dad, just do it.
FRANK: Okay, okay.
JOHN: Right, now I need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep.
FRANK: Then you gotta hide it somewhere. Somewhere where nobody's gonna find it.for 29 years! Put it under the loose floorboard by the I gotcha, I gotcha Chief!
JULIA: Then you gotta hide it somewhere. Somewhere where nobody's gonna find it.for 29 years! Put it under the loose floorboard by the I gotcha, I gotcha Chief!
FRANK: ( getting it now ) I gotcha, I gotcha Chief!
JOHN: It's gonna work, Dad. We're gonna stop Hang on.
FRANK: Hang on.
JOHN: We're in business. Just sit tight.and don't worry.
JOHN: What the hell?
CARL SHEPARD: HE'S 30 YEARS OLDER than when he tangled with Frank in the men's room last night, but this is the killer- Carl Shepard. Below Shepard's photo, various biographical information: social security, address, current employment, and a New York City Police Department Discharge - September 1973.
ON JOHN: A strange look of recognition.
HECTOR: What are you talkin' about? I know this prick. He worked outta Brooklyn North.
JOHN: ( realizing ) He never died.
JOHN: Just came by to wrap up over there. Thought I'd say "hello."
SHEPARD: Glad you did. Come on in. Buy you a cup of coffee?
JOHN: ( beat ) Wife around?
SHEPARD: ( a startled half-laugh ) No. No. Well, sort of. In my heart. Been dead 29 years.
JOHN: Oh. Sorry. How so?
MR. SHEPARD: Well, she, Eve was murdered, Detective. An ugly one to tell you the truth.
JOHN: Happens that way sometimes. Son still on the job?
MR. SHEPARD: Nah. Doin' P.I. work now. Got caught up in them Knapp Hearings. Set up by some dirty cops who needed a fall guy. Hurt him bad. Would've broken his mother's
JOHN: You used to be on the job?
SHEPARD: Yeah, long time ago. I know you?
JOHN: I look familiar?
SHEPARD: ( looking him over ) No. What house you work?
JOHN: The 2-3. Homicide.
SHEPARD: A hot shot, huh?
JOHN: Nah, just working the job.
SHEPARD: I hear that.
JOHN: As a matter of fact, I caught a case that goes back to your day.one of the Nightingale murders. No kiddin'?
SHEPARD: No kiddin'?
JOHN: No. Missing teenager. Disappeared thirty years ago. Found her bones last week. Buried behind some old diner, up by Dyckman street. Mary Finelli.
SHEPARD: ( sipping drink ) Talk about dumb luck. Odds of anybody finding that girl, thirty years later. And then the chances of hitting a dental.forget about it. Bets part is she's the first victim. She knew the doer. I'm betting those bones are gonna do a lot of talking.

SHEPARD: Who are you?
JOHN: I'm the train wreck you didn't see coming. And I'm gonna steal your life away. You went down 30 years ago. You just don't know it yet.
FRANK: You're telling me this maniac is a cop? What the hell am I supposed to do with that one?
JOHN: Call the FBI. Use a pay phone. Don't give 'em your name, Dad. Just tell 'em that it was Shepard who killed Finelli and Clark and the others. That he's the
FRANK: Okay, I'm on it. Hello, Frank.
SATCH: Hello, Frank.
FRANK: What are you doing here, Satch? You off Dad, you there?
SATCH: Frank, we need to talk.
FRANK: ( into radio ) John, hold on a second. ( to Satch ) I'm in the middle of something important here. You mind if.
SATCH: I'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come
FRANK: ( into mic ) Just a minute, John.okay? Don't go
SATCH: I think you know, Frank.
FRANK: No, I don't.
SATCH: Let's go outside and talk. We need to do About what?
FRANK: About what?
SATCH: Let's go. Do us both a favor.
FRANK: ( to Julia ) It's okay, Bud. I'll be right back. ( into radio ) Stay there, John.
SATCH: Where were you last night, Frank?
FRANK: What do you mean?
SATCH: Do you know where I found this?
FRANK: No. This isn't what you think.
SATCH: I wanna be wrong here. But we need to go to the precinct and talk about it.
FRANK: Okay, okay. I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio.
SATCH: You can talk to Julia. Forget the radio.
FRANK: Trust me, Bud. Do that for me.
FRANK: John, you there?
FRANK: Satch is busting me for Sissy Clark's murder. John.
FRANK: .you gotta help me, Chief.
SATCH: That's not the deal, Frank. Don't do this to your family.
JOHN'S POV: We see what John sees in 1998. But we also go inside his mind and glimpse flashes of new childhood memories. Memories of seeing his father arrested for murder. Images that match JOHNNY'S POV from moments ago in 1969.
FRANK: Carl Shepard. Detective out of the 15th
SATCH: Uh, huh. Uh, huh. And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
FRANK: As nuts as that sounds, yes.
SATCH: Uh, huh.
FRANK: Satch, would you listen to me here. Just you and me. Can I talk to you here,
SATCH: Give me a little time with this guy.
FRANK: He's not gonna stop, Satch. He's gonna keep on.
SATCH: Are you listening to me? You're in a world of shit. An eye witness has you outside the dead girl's apartment. We got your prints all over the place. Plus the fucking driver's license, Frank. You gotta give me something here. Something I can believe.
FRANK: What if I could prove it to you, Satch?
SATCH: How's that?
FRANK: What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0. And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the Frank, please.
SATCH: Frank, please.
FRANK: The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
SATCH: Frank, this is insane.
FRANK: In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run. Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th. The Mets are gonna win 5-3. Go watch the game, Satch.
SATCH: Go watch the game? Go watch the fucking game? Frank, they're gonna make you for Sissy Clark's murderer. It matches the Nightingale's profile. You understand what that means?
PHIL: His wife is here. She wants to talk to
SATCH: Whatta you want me to tell her?
FRANK: She's in harm's way. He's gonna be coming for her.
SATCH: ( after a beat ) Let's walk, get a cup of coffee.
SHEPARD: You got a collar in here for the Nightingale murders?
SHEPARD: I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North. You mind I take a shot at him?
SHEPARD: They around?
SHEPARD: Where's the collar, in the cells?
SHEPARD: I'll go find Hayes.
SHEPARD: On your feet.
FRANK: ( facing the wall ) You twisted animal.
SHEPARD: Evidence says you're the animal. That's why you hung yourself.
FRANK: You try putting that thing around my neck and I'll rip your throat out. You want me dead, use the gun.
SHEPARD: Let me draw you a picture. You live at 1060 41st Ave. You have a wife who works at New York Hospital. And a six-year old at P.S. 130.
PHIL: What the hell is going on here?
FRANK: You got to help me. He's trying to kill
SHEPARD: Mind if we take it outside?
SHEPARD: .didn't mean t step on your toes. They sent me up from downstairs, I thought you'd be in there with him.
PHIL: What are you looking at him for?
PHIL: Yeah, half the uniforms are either at the game or on the street. It's gonna be a riot if they pull it off.
SHEPARD: ( glancing down the hall - in What's the score?
TV ANNOUNCER: Hadges is coming outta the dug out. He's calling for the ball. Can we get a shot of the ball?
SATCH: Can you excuse me for a second?
TV ANNOUNCER: There's a scuff mark on the ball! The umpire has reversed his decision. He's sending Jones to first base!
SHEPARD: ( yelling over the noise ) You mind I go back at teh fire boy for a while? I won't lay a hand on him, just want to see what he's got?
PHIL: Go ahead, knock yourself out.
JULIA: What's going on, Satch? I don't know.
SATCH: ( dumbfounded ) I don't know.
SATCH: ( yelling over the madness ) He was right! Everything he said. He was telling the truth.
JULIA: Then you believe him?
SATCH: Yeah I do. You bet your life I do.
FRANK: ( little smile ) Elvis has left the building.
SHEPARD: ( over phone ) You have the right to remain silent. If you give up that right.
JOHN: You have the right to remain silent. If you give up that right.
SHEPARD: Who the fuck is this?
JOHN: Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
SHEPARD: You have the right to speak to an att
JOHN: You have the right to speak to an att
SHEPARD: Fuck you, asshole.
JOHN: It's a small world, Carl. And I'm gonna find you. Real soon.
CLOSE ON: Frank's hand, groping for the handle of a glass pitcher atop the kitchen counter. Shepard reaches for his gun, points the .357 at Frank's head. Shepard's finger squeezing the trigger. It's over. But. FRANK SMASHES THE GLASS PITCHER down on Shepard's skull. Shepard drops. CRACK, the gun fires, BLASTING AIR. FRANK scrambles for the window. He's outta there, expertly thundering down fire escape.
FRANK: Detective Deleon.
SATCH: INTERCUT FRANK.
FRANK: Satch, you gotta listen to me.
SATCH: Frank. We know. We know it's Shepard.
FRANK: No kidding. I'm on the corner of 65th and CPW. Come get me.
JULIA: ( over phone )
SATCH: You missed a hell of a game, Frank.
FRANK: Next time lets put some money on it.
SATCH: ( to the uniform driver ) Get him home safe.
FRANK: Hey, bud.
JULIA: And she is out of the chair. They meet in a hug. Over her shoulder Frank takes a long look at his sleeping son.
JOHN: I'm here, Dad. I'm here.
FRANK: We did it, John. We stopped him.
JOHN: Wait. Something's wrong. I don't.
FRANK: What's wrong?
JOHN: I don't remember. Why don't I remember?
JOHN: Dad? Dad? What's.
SHEPARD: My turn to steal your life.
SHEPARD: You're a clever fuck, fireboy.
SHEPARD: Time to meet the family.
FRANK: ( struggling to breathe ) This is between you and me.
SHEPARD: Not any more.
JULIA: Hey, Bud. Want to join me?
SHEPARD: Sure do.
SHEPARD: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - CONTINUOUS Frank's wrists are bleeding. He can't get out. But then he sees something. Something he can use. His WATCH. Frank struggles to unfasten the watch strap. He does it. He pinches the metal clasp with his thumb and forefinger and guides it to the keyhole in the left handcuff. He works it. Nothing. Then CLICK. He's out!
FRANK: Get your fucking hands off my wife.
SHEPARD: Don't. Don't do it, Frank. You're not a
SHEPARD: You were the kid. I remember now.
FRANK: I'm still here, Chief.
LATER: We are soaring high above a baseball diamond. Clear light air, you can see for miles. Float down to the field. The first taste of Spring and Softball. Picnic baskets. Flowers. Kites flying. Children running. The bleachers filled with families and loved ones. Among them sits SAMANTHA. She's smiling, she's glowing.she's pregnant. PULL BACK to reveal SATCH, GORDO, ELLEN & GORDY JR. A dalmation puppy scampers at their feet, barking in recognition as. Frank Sullivan steps into the batter's box.
CLOSE ON: Pitcher: 22 year-old African-Amerasian, a muscular beanpole. Embroidered on the back of the his FDNY jersey is his nickname: PHIRE POWER. Quick shot of first baseman. GRAHAM GIBSON - once a nervous PROBIE, now a seasoned vet. And one hell of proud father.
GIBSON: ( to pitcher ) Take it easy on him son, he's older than
CLOSE ON: John as he makes his way to the plate. Check out his eyes: they're different, he looks like his father. They've got that Frank Sullivan sparkle. John steps into the batter's box, cocks back to wood.
FRANK: Bring me home, son! Bring me home!
JOHN: Hey there, Chief.
CLOSE ON: John's face. In his eyes, bliss. CUE Bruce Springsteen's: TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALLGAME.
