FRANKENSTEIN: Written by Steph Lady & Frank Darabont From the novel by Mary W. Shelley
WALTON: PULL, YOU BASTARDS! PULL!
WALTON: Cut the damn rigging free before we lose the mast!
IIIICEBEEEEERG!: THE CROW'S NEST ( MAST #2 ) The LOOKOUT is lashed to the mast by means of a safety rope knotted at the chest. He points ahead. WALTON and the others spin to look as A PANORAMIC SHOT OF THE BARENTS SEA reveals a magnificent vista of storming fury. The ship is heading into an enormous field of icebergs dotting the ocean like boulders in a quarry, The Nevsky is plying these waters like a man running pell-mell through a mine An iceberg passes massively and unexpectedly in the foreground, rumbling within yards of the camera, wiping us into darkness.
WALTON: HARD TO PORT!
GRIGORI: It's going to ram us.
WALTON: It wouldn't dare.
SHIP'S POV: Crashing through the swells. Rising and falling. Tilting the world and the audience on its ear. iceberg looming. For a brief moment we seem to be veering past. But then we swing back in a final, churning, vertiginous plunge. .and smack the ice.
WALTON: Put your backs into it!
SAILOR #1: What's the use? This godless ice stretches for miles! Would you have us chow our way back to England?
WALTON: No. But we'll chop our way to the North Pole if we have to. Inch by bloody inch.
GRIGORI: You can't mean to go on! Our journey is ended! The best we can hope for now is to get out of this alive!
SAILOR #2: Aye, if the ice ever lets us!
WALTON: The ice will break. And when it does, we proceed north. as planned.
GRIGORI: At the cost of how many more lives?
GRIGORI: There's something out there.
WALTON: You five come with me! The rest stay with the ship!
GRIGORI: They follow his gaze. Bloody tracks lead away from the bodies, ascending the rocks. Most are smeared and vague. but one is clearly a bare human footprint. Several men cross themselves. Walton shoulders the rifle, aims down at the surviving dog. BLAM! A single bullet to the brain ends its misery, punching a halo of blood onto the ice. The shot echoes for miles.
WALTON: Back to the ship.
OLD SAILOR: Only the ice to starboard, boy.
YOUNG SAILOR: Is it breaking up?
OLD SAILOR: Just dancing on the current. It'll freeze even tighter come next wind.
SAILOR #4: It was a polar bear. That's what I Say all you want, but you weren't there. It left human tracks.
SAILOR #5: Say all you want, but you weren't there. It left human tracks.
SAILOR #6: No man could tear those dogs apart.
SAILOR #5: No human. We've roused a demon from the ice.
SAILOR: Something. In the mist.
YOUNG SAILOR: It's the demon! Shoot while you've a
WALTON: Grigori cautiously eases his hand into the darkness of the furred hood to search the neck for a pulse. .and the figure scares the shit out of him. With a convulsive shudder and a gasping intake of breath, the hood rises up, revealing a haggard face tortured white with frost, beard frozen solid, eyes blazingly intelligent and aware. Walton finds himself in an extended beat of eye contact with
GRIGORI: Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back Then you run the danger of pushing them to mutiny.
WALTON: They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back Then you run the danger of pushing them to mutiny.
GRIGORI: Then you run the danger of pushing them to mutiny.
WALTON: ( low, tight ) Let them try.
WALTON: You're awake. I've prepared some broth. It'll help restore you.
VICTOR: ( hoarse, faltering ) I'm. dying.
VICTOR: Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple Are you a physician?
WALTON: Are you a physician?
VICTOR: ( faint smile ) How is it you come to be here?
WALTON: There's a startling question, coming from you. I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole.
VICTOR: Ah. An explorer.
WALTON: Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
VICTOR: I heard.
WALTON: I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of. creature.
VICTOR: Creature? A. human like creature?
WALTON: ( stunned ) You know of it?
VICTOR: Your men are right to be afraid.
WALTON: Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
VICTOR: You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
WALTON: Lives are ephemeral. The knowledge we gain, the achievements we leave behind. those live on.
VICTOR: Do you share my madness?
WALTON: CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY on Victor's face.
VICTOR: We are kindred, you and I. Men of ambition. Let me tell you all that I have lost in such pursuits. I pray my story will come to mean for you all that is capricious and evil in Who are you?
WALTON: ( angry, frightened ) Who are you?
VICTOR: ( beat ) My name is Frankenstein.
FATHER: Mrs. Moritz, would you and your daughter excuse us?
MRS. MORITZ: Of course, Doctor. Madam. Come along, Justine. Bring your dolly.
MOTHER: Victor. This is Elizabeth. She's coming to live with us.
FATHER: She has lost her parents to scarlet fever. She is an orphan.
MOTHER: You must think of her as your own sister. You must look after her. And be kind to her.
MOTHER: Victor. Elizabeth is frightened by the storm. Go comfort her.
VICTOR: Don't cry, Elizabeth.
ELIZABETH: ( frightened ) Aren't you?
VICTOR: We'll build a fort. So the lightning can't get us.
ELIZABETH: Are you sure it can't hurt us?
VICTOR: Nothing can. Not ever.
MRS. MORITZ: You must lead, Victor. The lady will always look to you for guidance, so your steps must be sure and strong.
VICTOR: Mrs. Moritz.
MRS. MORITZ: .aaand, one-two-three, one-two- three, twirl-two-three.
JUSTINE: Mama, can I dance with Victor?
MRS. MORITZ: Nonsense, Justine. Hush. And now a sweeping arc about the room! one- two-three, twirl-two-three.
MRS. MORITZ: .one-two-three, twirl-two-three. Excellent! You'll be the envy of all the young ladies and gentlemen!
MRS. MORITZ: Justine. Surely you can maintain better time than that.
JUSTINE: Yes, Mama.
ELIZABETH: She'll be all right.
MRS. MORITZ: You can do nothing here. Wait
VICTOR: Victor, do as you're told!
FATHER: Victor, do as you're told!
VICTOR: As a boy, I stood at this window and watched God destroy our tree.
VICTOR: A FLASH OF LIGHTNING floods the room, revealing Victor's father on the staircase. Face haggard. Eyes hollow. Clothes spattered with blood. Hands glistening wetly red.
ELIZABETH: Oh God. The blood.
FATHER: I did everything I could.
VICTOR: How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?
ELIZABETH: It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.
VICTOR: What kind of God is He to will this?
ELIZABETH: She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him. I cannot do that alone.
VICTOR: God took her from us.
ELIZABETH: He left a beautiful gift in her place. A baby boy. To cherish and love as our very own. Your brother
VICTOR: Our brother.
JUSTINE: Poor William! What indignant tears!
ELIZABETH: There, there. shhh.
ELIZABETH: Victor, have a care! You'll make him The world is a dizzying place.
VICTOR: The world is a dizzying place.
ELIZABETH: Oh, do give him here! He needs to be comforted and held!
VICTOR: He needs to vent his outrage to the skies! Make yourself heard, Willie! Learning to walk is not an easy thing! Why should it be so?
ELIZABETH: That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.
JUSTINE: Quite right!
VICTOR: Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a feast to be consumed. Women would have you believe you must walk before you can run. Or run before you can Give me that child before you fill his head with drivel!
ELIZABETH: ( laughing ) Give me that child before you fill his head with drivel!
VICTOR: Devil take walking, ladies! My brother shall learn to waltz!
JUSTINE: Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!
ELIZABETH: Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
JUSTINE: ( thinks a beat ) One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl-
WILLIE: Auntie Justine, Papa said I could have a sweet.
JUSTINE: You can. But not before dinner.
JUSTINE: You dance so beautifully together.
ELIZABETH: And you look so lovely.
JUSTINE: Victor? Spare me one dance?
ELIZABETH: Go on, ask her. Please. I'm quite out of breath.
FATHER: My friends, fatherly pride won't allow this occasion to pass without my raising a toast.
FATHER: To Victor. My son. Who read every medical book in my library by age thirteen. and then re-read them, which seemed excessive even to me. Drape yourself in glory, my boy. Study well. When you return, you return a man of medicine. I will then be honored to call you But never your equal.
VICTOR: But never your equal.
FATHER: No. You'll surpass me.
ELIZABETH: Smell the air. Wonderful.
VICTOR: Quite a send-off, isn't it?
ELIZABETH: Father's so proud.
VICTOR: And you?
ELIZABETH: Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
VICTOR: I'll have to do better than that.
ELIZABETH: You will. What do you want, Victor?
VICTOR: To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams. to eradicate disease and pestilence. to purge mankind of ignorance and fear.
VICTOR: I'm not mad.
ELIZABETH: No. Just very earnest. And very dear. I've loved you all my life
VICTOR: I've loved you all my life
ELIZABETH: All my life I've known.
VICTOR: This feels. incestuous.
ELIZABETH: Is that what makes it so delicious?
ELIZABETH: Brother and sister still?
VICTOR: I wish to be your husband.
ELIZABETH: I wish to be your wife.
VICTOR: Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
ELIZABETH: If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
VICTOR: Only you.
ELIZABETH: I will be here when you return.
ELIZABETH: My head is spinning. I want to give myself to you.
ELIZABETH: If we're to be married, must we wait?
VICTOR: You make me weak.
ELIZABETH: Not as weak as I.
ELIZABETH: Our decision. Together.
VICTOR: Your decision. For us.
ELIZABETH: ( hesitates ) I give you my soul.
VICTOR: ( nods ) .until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.
ELIZABETH: Victor. I love you,
VICTOR: Elizabeth. My more than sister.
VICTOR: I'll make you so proud, Mother.
FATHER: Write to us often.
VICTOR: We never finished our dance. Someday we shall.
VICTOR: The others will look to you while I'm gone, Willie. Be strong.
VICTOR: He mounts the carriage. CLAUDE snaps the reins and lurches away, speeding Victor off to his future. Victor turns back for a final look at the home and family he loves so much. William runs after him until he's gone from sight.
FRAU BRACH: No real rooms left. All we've got is attic space. No one ever wants the attic space.
VICTOR: This will do nicely.
KREMPE: In science, the letter of fact is the letter of law. Our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept. Think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect. Someday you may be priests. but only if you learn the scripture chapter and Any questions?
VICTOR: ( hand shoots up ) But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more. philosophical works.
KREMPE: Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. Paracelsus, for one.
VICTOR: Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. Paracelsus, for one.
KREMPE: Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius What is your name?
VICTOR: Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius What is your name?
KREMPE: What is your name?
VICTOR: Victor Frankenstein, sir. Of geneva.
KREMPE: Of Geneva. Tell me, Mr. Frankenstein of Geneva. Do you wish to study medicine? Or
KREMPE: Those of you unfamiliar with Mr. Frankenstein's suggested reading list. thankfully, that would be most of you. would be well advised to avoid it. Here at Ingolstadt, we concern ourselves with immutable .not the ravings of lunatics and alchemists hundreds of years in their graves. Understood?
KREMPE: I am relieved. Are there any relevant Lecture hall dismissed.
HENRY: I was just clearing my throat.
VICTOR: Very well then.
HENRY: You know, you're quite mad.
VICTOR: ( low, measured ) I am not mad.
HENRY: ( matching Victor's tone ) As a march hare.
VICTOR: Are you having me on?
HENRY: Of course I am. It pays to humor the
HENRY: Henry Clerval.
VICTOR: Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
HENRY: I know. You have a way of making an
VICTOR: Do you really think I'm mad?
HENRY: Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing you know, you'll be teaching toadstools to speak.
SCHILLER: If it isn't the sorcerer. Found yourself an apprentice?
VICTOR: I'm afraid I rejected his application. He merely dabbles.
HENRY: Dilettantes need not apply. What about you? Schiller, isn't it?
SCHILLER: Von Schiller. I'm interested in real medicine. Treating the sick.
HENRY: Really? I myself find sick people rather revolting. I'm here to secure my degree with a minimum of fuss and hard work that I might settle into a life of privilege treating rich old ladies with gout and dallying with their daughters.
SCHILLER: You two disgust me.
VICTOR: Rich old ladies and their daughters?
HENRY: Can you think of a better reason?
VICTOR: Quite a few.
HENRY: Do me a favor then. .keep them to yourself.
CLAUDE: It's turning out to be a good year.
ELIZABETH: Let's return a tenth of the crop to the tenants. They had a hard winter.
CLAUDE: Not even your father would be that Then there's no need to tell him, is
ELIZABETH: Then there's no need to tell him, is
STABLEBOY: Miss! The mail arrived! There's one from Master Victor!
ELIZABETH: .and not a day goes by that I do not cherish your faces in my mind's eye or ache to see you all again. Be assured that I am with you in spirit, and you are never far from my thoughts. I remain, as always, your loving and devoted Victor. P.S.
ELIZABETH: glances up at their expectant faces.
WILLIE: What does it say?
ELIZABETH: It says, give Willie an extra big hug for me.
WILLIAM: ( beaming ) Read it again?
KREMPE: I'll see you thrown out of this university! I'll go to the dean himself! Take me at my word, Frankenstein! The dean himself!
HENRY: The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss.
VICTOR: You're a comfort to me, Henry.
HENRY: What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
VICTOR: ( quietly ) It's a letter to my father.
VICTOR: Professor Waldman.
WALDMAN: ( takes a seat ) Victor, explain yourself.
VICTOR: Krempe has a way of provoking my You have a way of provoking his. I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
WALDMAN: You have a way of provoking his. I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
VICTOR: To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.
WALDMAN: You disdain accepted wisdom?
VICTOR: No, I embrace it. as something to be used or discarded as we advance the boundaries of what is known.
HENRY: ( mutters to Waldman ) Now you've got him started.
VICTOR: These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought
HENRY: .yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before.
VICTOR: But you haven't listened, Never in history has so much seemed possible. We're on the verge of answers undreamt of. but only if we have the courage to ask the questions.
WALDMAN: I understand your frustration. I was young once myself. Walk me home. Something I'd like to show you.
WALDMAN: You know for thousands of years the Chinese have based their medical science on the belief that the human body is a chemical engine run by electricity? They say we all contain streams of energy which flow through us like currents in the ocean, or rivers in the earth.
WALDMAN: Their doctors treat patients by inserting needles like these into the flesh at various key points to manipulate these electric streams.
VICTOR: I once saw it done, as a boy in Canton. My parents were missionaries. The cure was nothing short of I've never forgotten it. Been fascinated ever since.
WALDMAN: I once saw it done, as a boy in Canton. My parents were missionaries. The cure was nothing short of I've never forgotten it. Been fascinated ever since.
HENRY: It smacks of magic.
WALDMAN: Magic. Seems alive, doesn't it?
WALDMAN: It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!
VICTOR: It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!
WALDMAN: Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
VICTOR: But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous. Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go. What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.

You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.
VICTOR: I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
WALDMAN: ( waves ) Nonsense. Tonight you will draft an apology to Professor Krempe.
WALDMAN: ".a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty.
VICTOR: ( draws close ) Our profession needs talent like yours. Destroy your career over an issue of pride? What a waste.
WALDMAN: ( draws close ) Our profession needs talent like yours. Destroy your career over an issue of pride? What a waste.
WALDMAN: Go home, Victor. Write the letter,
VICTOR: .and I further wish to extend my sincerest regrets to Professor Krempe for my display. My behavior toward him was both rash and inexcusable.
JUSTINE: Must've been a terrible row.
ELIZABETH: He was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a "pompous. He always was opinionated.
FATHER: He always was opinionated.
ELIZABETH: ( reads on, laughs ) He set things right with a proper apology. and now they've put him in charge of dissection lab!
WILLIE: What's that?
FATHER: That's where they cut things open and peer about inside.
WILLIE: Things? What sort of things?
ELIZABETH: It's far too ghoulish for your young
ELIZABETH: The point is, your brother is a brilliant student well on his way to becoming the finest-and most compassionate doctor ever.
WALDMAN: Re-configure the leads?
VICTOR: Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?
WALDMAN: Worth a try.
VICTOR: .and the medulla oblongata is the transition between the spinal cord and the two parts I've already named. cerebrum and cerebellum. Any freshmen feeling queasy yet? All of you, from the look of it. We'll resume your torture tomorrow.
KREMPE: You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.
VICTOR: Despite the lack of challenge.
WALDMAN: Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
VICTOR: The strain was evident.
HENRY: Come now, you must take some satisfaction. You've risen to the top of your class. A position of prominence and regard.
VICTOR: What keeps me going are my friends.
HENRY: Leave off!
HENRY: Your Elizabeth must be quite a treasure, Victor .to justify these prices.
HENRY: ( deadpan ) Shouldn't the nose be above the mouth?
WALDMAN: I'm quite serious. Look at all the charity and clinic work we do. Up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of.
HENRY: You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
WALDMAN: I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
HENRY: ( turning serious ) Do you foresee this happening in our No. But someday.
WALDMAN: No. But someday.
HENRY: Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.
VICTOR: Only you would think of that!
HENRY: ( laughing ) Somebody has to!
VICTOR: I tell you what we need, my friends. Forget the symptoms and diseases. What we need is a vaccine for death Oh, now you have gone too far. There's only one God, Victor.
WALDMAN: ( laughter ) Oh, now you have gone too far. There's only one God, Victor.
HENRY: ( raises his glass ) And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.
VICTOR: ( grins ) Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
MAN: Yer not stickin' it in me! Got pox in it, I hear tell!
FAT WOMAN: Pox? They givin' us pox?
WALDMAN: No, it's not pox, it's a vaccine.
FAT WOMAN: .vaccine, from the Latin vacca, meaning cow .or vaccinia, meaning cowpox.
WALDMAN: .vaccine, from the Latin vacca, meaning cow .or vaccinia, meaning cowpox.
MAN: I told you there was pox in it!
WALDMAN: .no, no, cowpox in a minute quantity, perfectly harmless, gives you a natural immunity to small ox, which is the point of this whole bloody exercise.
MAN: You doctors kill people! I don' care what you say, you ain't stickin' it in me!
WALDMAN: I most assuredly am! It prevents disease and it's the law! Why am I explaining myself? Somebody restrain this damn fool!
HENRY: ( softly ) Oh God.
WALDMAN: ( softly ) Oh God.
HENRY: They just caught the man who did it.
VICTOR: He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
HENRY: They'll hang him all the same.
VICTOR: Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap.
HENRY: Keep your voice down. You don't know what you're saying.
VICTOR: It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't have happened! The bastard deserves to die.
HENRY: You're making a scene!
VICTOR: Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!
HENRY: You can't. Death is God's will!
VICTOR: I resent God's monopoly.
HENRY: That's blasphemy!
VICTOR: Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
HENRY: All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
VICTOR: ( beat, low ) No. He had more important work.
HENRY: There are sick people who need our help. Here and now. Not in some future time. Consider that.
VICTOR: Life and death. Why should You alone have the final
VICTOR: To understand the causes of life, we must first have recourse to death. and examine the process in minutest
MAGISTRATE: .his body to be left on public display for a twenty-four hour period, thereafter to be consigned to an unmarked pauper's grave. So the court has spoken.
VICTOR: No longer pathetic and useless
HENRY: Victor. This has got to stop. Nobody's seen you in months. You haven't attended a single class.
VICTOR: I've been preoccupied.
HENRY: We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.
VICTOR: That is my concern. I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's How much longer?
HENRY: How much longer?
VICTOR: Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now.
VICTOR: Materials. That's all they are Tissue to be re-used.
ELIZABETH: Nothing. Still nothing.
JUSTINE: It's been months. It's not like him.
ELIZABETH: Something's wrong. I know it. I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
JUSTINE: So have I
ELIZABETH: I should go. I should leave today.
JUSTINE: Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt. Besides, they're only rumors.
ELIZABETH: ( beat, nods ) And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
JUSTINE: Read him one of the old letters and rephrase it. We'll say it came today. It'll set his mind at ease.
VICTOR: That one.
MAN: With this cholera come to town, we'll have plenty more for you.
VICTOR: Not optimal. Must use. No time to replace. Body can't wait.
HENRY: God's sake, what is that stench?
VICTOR: This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy just now. What do you want?
HENRY: Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.
VICTOR: Yes? And?
HENRY: Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
VICTOR: You'll be leaving then. Just as well. You never were cut out for this, Henry. Goodbye.
HENRY: VICTOR! OPEN THE DOOR! LISTEN TO
REASON!: Nothing. Stunned and hurt, Henry turns from the door and heads back down the stairs.
HENRY: Schiller? You're leaving? Where's all that high talk about treating the sick?
SCHILLER: ( icy ) To hell with them. And you.
VICTOR: Time running out. Rate of decay accelerating. Must strike now. or start again from scratch.
VICTOR: ( muffled through the glass ) Live, you bastard!
VICTOR: It's alive. It's alive.
VICTOR: What have I done?
VICTOR: LET GO OF ME!
VICTOR: Massive birth defects. Result is malfunctional and vile. Have chosen to abort.
VICTOR: Stay away!
ROUGH MAN: Stupid bastard!
VENDOR'S WIFE: BURN HIM! BURN HIM!
WORKER #1: Over here!
WORKER #2: Oh my God.
HENRY: Worker #2 also sweeps his mask aside. Professor Krempe.
KREMPE: Don't dawdle, lad! The sick cart! Lift on three! One, two, three!
VICTOR: ( delirious, struggling ) No. no. I'm not dead. please. Don't put me on the cart! I'm not dead! I'm not dead! I'M NOT DEAD!
ANOTHER ANGLE: .and walks around the corner of the house just as the Creature scrambles from view behind the chicken coops. The Creature watches through the wire and wood as Felix approaches and stops, only his legs visible. Feed is scattered through the wire. The chickens begins to eat. The Creature backs up
MARIE: Bring Grandfather to the table.
HENRY: Thank God your fever broke. Slowly, now. Just a sip. I've been worried we might lose you. It's been touch-and-go for a week.
VICTOR: A. week?
HENRY: We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.
VICTOR: Is that your diagnosis?
HENRY: Mine and Professor Krempe's. We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
VICTOR: You've been going round-the-clock?
HENRY: We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.
VICTOR: ( deeply moved ) Everything in moderation, Clerval.
HENRY: Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein.
HENRY: It's the down-and-outs I pity most. Those who can't fend for themselves. They'll be dead by the thousands before this is done. They don't stand a chance out there.
VICTOR: ( thinking of his creation ) No. They don't.
HENRY: Victor. This place looked like a charnel house. What went on here?
VICTOR: I want to go home.
HENRY: It'll be months before you're well enough. Meantime, your family must be frantic not hearing from you.
HENRY: I found these. Some of the postmarks go back nine months. Why don't you open them? And when you've the strength, have the decency to ease their minds with a reply. Soon as the city ends quarantine, I'll even mail it for you. Along with this. It's a beautiful gift. Does her no good lying here.
VICTOR: It can't survive.
FELIX: Not much to look at. Even less to eat. I don't how we're going to get through the winter with this yield.
MARIE: We'll sell another pig at market.
FELIX: One less for us.
MARIE: We'll make do. We always have.
FELIX: I'll see if I can scratch a few more out of the ground.
GRANDFATHER: I wish we could thank our benefactor.
FELIX: Nothing in this life comes free of cost. I'd like to know who and why.
MAGGIE: It's the Good Spirit of the forest.
FELIX: Who's been filling your head?
GRANDFATHER: It does no harm.
FELIX: ( peers at him ) Oh, I see.
THOMAS: Is it, Papa? Is it the Good Spirit?
MARIE: Of course it is. Now finish your food before it gets cold.
GRANDFATHER: Who's there? Felix? Children?
MAGGIE: ff..reh..nn..nd. Friend? Friend.

HENRY: A woman like that is far too rare to be taken lightly.

CREATURE: It's me! It's mmmmeeeeee!
CREATURE: HOUSE - NIGHT We hear furniture CRASHING, glass SHATTERING, shelves being ripped from walls. A faint glow kicks up. Flames rise within. The Creature exits with a flaming torch, spins back to watch. He has new possessions: an armload of books jammed in a satchel, some extra clothes on his body, the old man's recorder jammed in his belt. A HOWLING WIND whips up, billowing his coat and hair, fanning the flames even higher. He raises his torch, HOWLING along with the wind, reflected fire seething in his eyes, exulting as the house is consumed.
CREATURE: AERIAL SHOT sweeps up the slope of the glacier like the wind itself, rising magnificently past the tiny figure standing on the ridge, sailing up over the crest. to reveal the valley and lake of Geneva below.
HENRY: Our carriage is here.
MRS. KREMPE: ( watching the gates ) Such a terrible winter. I'll praise God to see those gates open again.
KREMPE: I'll have all your things sent on. They should arrive soon after. It's been a rough time, lad. For us all. But if you'd like to come back and finish out your final term once university re-opens.
VICTOR: Thank you, Professor. For everything.
KREMPE: Write and let us know you've arrived
VICTOR: Take me home, my friend.
WILLIAM: HE'S COMING HOME!
WILLIAM: Elizabeth! Justine!
FATHER: What's all the fuss? Why are you He's coming home! Tonight!
WILLIAM: He's coming home! Tonight!
ELIZABETH: Who? Victor?
WILLIAM: That's what I'm telling you!
ELIZABETH: ( swept with relief ) Thank God.
FATHER: Open it.
WILLIAM: It's Victor!
JUSTINE: It's beautiful! May I? He looks so handsome.
FATHER: What does it say?
ELIZABETH: Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left. He's coming home to marry me.
WILLIAM: Married! The two of you?
FATHER: Brilliant! I knew it! Ever since you were children!
JUSTINE: ( softly ) That's wonderful.
WILLIAM: Elizabeth? Can I take this to show Willie, it's not a toy for your I'll take extra special care, I promise! Pete's never seen what Victor looks like! He'll admire it
ELIZABETH: Willie, it's not a toy for your I'll take extra special care, I promise! Pete's never seen what Victor looks like! He'll admire it

MRS. MORITZ: Justine! Pay attention!
JUSTINE: ( tight ) Yes, Mother.
ELIZABETH: ( pulls her aside ) Are you all right?
JUSTINE: ( even tighter )
JUSTINE: I'll be all right. Really.
FATHER: Have you seen Willie?
ELIZABETH: Is he not back yet?
FATHER: Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.
ELIZABETH: It's far too late for him to still be out.
CLAUDE: Don't worry, Monsieur, we'll find
ELIZABETH: LIGHTNING dances on the horizon. A storm approaching.
WILLIE!: LIGHTNING dances on the horizon. A storm approaching.

VICTOR: There! Look!
HENRY: Quite a place.
VICTOR: Thank you, Henry.
HENRY: For what?
VICTOR: This. My home. My family. If not for you, I'd be dead in a burial pit somewhere.
VICTOR: .and now others are converging on the scene, dark screaming figures in the storm. Victor reaches her first as the others crowd around in a panic of confusion, crushing and jostling as she collapses into Victor's arms, all of them cradling Willie, and then Father is there, shoving his way through, seeing his dead boy and collapsing in the muck with a SCREAM, and suddenly Henry is there shouting for the men to lift him and everybody is scrambling and screaming as we
MRS. MORITZ: Sir. I'm terrified for my girl.
VICTOR: ( softly ) We'll organize another search now that it's light enough. We'll find her, Mrs. Moritz, I promise.
ELIZABETH: What is Father's outlook?
HENRY: I am cautiously hopeful. With quiet and proper care he may eventually regain some or most of his strength.
ELIZABETH: Thank you, Henry.
POLICEMAN #1: Mr. Frankenstein. We've apprehended the murderer. Not five miles from here, hiding in a barn.
VICTOR: Who is it?
POLICEMAN #2: It's very unsettling, sir. And quite strange. Perhaps you'd better come with us.
FEMALE VOICE: .and leans into the light. Justine. Pale. Dazed. Scared
JUSTINE: Victor! It's you! Thank God!
JUSTINE: Is it true? What they say about Willie? Is it true?
VICTOR: She dissolves into tears. Barely able to breathe.
JUSTINE: Willie. My poor little angel. Victor! They think I did it!
VICTOR: Did you?
JUSTINE: ( low ) I don't believe. I am in need of your comfort. anymore.
VICTOR: ( a whisper ) Did you, Justine?
JUSTINE: Get out!
KITCHEN MAID: I found her sobbing her eyes out. Poor thing, I said, what's all this? And she spilled her heart to me about Master Victor. How she'd always loved him, and now he was coming home to marry mistress Elizabeth.
KITCHEN MAID: She cried and cried about the beautiful locket he'd sent. How she wished it was hers. She swore me never to tell a soul. That was before the boy went missing,
VICTOR: I always viewed her with brotherly affection. I had no idea of her feelings for me.
PROSECUTOR: Rejection can be a powerful wound. People have been known to do uncanny But to commit so ghastly and terrible a crime against a child she loved?
VICTOR: But to commit so ghastly and terrible a crime against a child she loved?
VICTOR: It's hard to believe.
ELIZABETH: Justine and I grew up as sisters. I know her better than anybody.
DEFENDING COUNSEL: Do you think it possible she committed this crime?
ELIZABETH: William was as much her child as mine. We were both mother to him. I believe she would sooner have strangled the life from her own body.
DEFENDING COUNSEL: Then you consider the charge without I consider the charge imbecilic.
ELIZABETH: I consider the charge imbecilic.
JUSTINE: Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer.
PROSECUTOR: And is it true, Miss Moritz, that you love Victor Frankenstein? That your heart was broken? Answer the question. Do you love Victor Frankenstein? I have always loved him.
JUSTINE: I have always loved him.
PROSECUTOR: Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
JUSTINE: Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my So you have claimed. Yet you have no explanation for this. The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. The locket you so coveted. How did it come to be in your I have no knowledge of that.

JUSTINE: I have no knowledge of that.
CREATURE: Victor is speechless with horror. The Creature raises his arm, pointing with an impossibly long and bony finger. Look there. Victor does. LIGHTNING dances in the sky, illuminating Mont Blanc with a crackling halo of electricity. and then the Creature is gone, vanishing like a shadow in the darkness. Victor falls gasping. The awful truth dawning. He rises, gazing at the scaffold, horrified.
VICTOR: Oh God. Oh God! No! NOOOOOOO!
VICTOR: Oh God. Justine. Forgive me.
VICTOR: My mind was not playing tricks. He was there in the storm. gloating over his crimes. challenging me to But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
ELIZABETH: But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
VICTOR: I've no choice
ELIZABETH: If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
VICTOR: They've done a fine job. Hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend.
ELIZABETH: ( softly ) Do you know this man? Is there something between you?
VICTOR: I know only that he is a killer. And I shall bring back his carcass.
VICTOR: WHERE ARE YOU?
CREATURE: Come warm yourself if you like.
VICTOR: You speak.
CREATURE: Yes, I speak. And read. And think. and know the ways of Man. I've been waiting for you. Two months How did you find me?
VICTOR: How did you find me?
CREATURE: The letters in your journal. That and a geography book. Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.
VICTOR: Kill me and have done with it.
CREATURE: Kill you? Hardly that.
VICTOR: Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
CREATURE: More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me? What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice. Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?
VICTOR: Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother.
CREATURE: Your crime. as well as mine.
VICTOR: How dare you. You're disgusting and Do you believe in evil?
CREATURE: ( scurries closer ) Do you believe in evil?
VICTOR: I see it before me.
CREATURE: I'm not sure I believe. But then I had no one to instruct me. I had no mother. and my father abandoned me at birth.
CREATURE: Were the dying cries of your brother music in my ears?
CREATURE: I took him by the throat with one hand. lifted him off the ground. And slowly crushed his neck. That poor, innocent child died in my grip. because all I could see was your face. and all I could feel was my rage. And when I let him go, he fluttered to the grass like a
CREATURE: Later, when they were searching, I followed the pretty lady who got lost in the woods.
CREATURE: You gave me these emotions, but you didn't tell me how to use them. Now two people are dead. Because of us.
CREATURE: Why, Victor? Why? What were you There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
VICTOR: There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
CREATURE: What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out? Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
VICTOR: Materials. Nothing more.
CREATURE: You're wrong. Do you know I knew how to play this?
CREATURE: In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart? And reading and speaking. Not things learned. so much as things Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
VICTOR: Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
CREATURE: Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these? Who am I?
VICTOR: ( hollow ) I don't know.
CREATURE: Then perhaps I believe in evil after
VICTOR: What can I do?
CREATURE: There is something I want. A friend.
VICTOR: A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
CREATURE: A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
VICTOR: Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
CREATURE: I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all. I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours. You're the one who set this in motion, And if I consent?
VICTOR: And if I consent?
CREATURE: We'd travel north, my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. No human eye would ever see us again. This I vow.
CREATURE: Yes. I want this over and done with.
VICTOR: Yes. I want this over and done with.
CREATURE: I'll be waiting. And watching.
ELIZABETH: I thought I'd never see you again!
VICTOR: I'm all right. I'm safe,
HENRY: What happened up there?
VICTOR: I didn't find what I was looking What did you find?
CLAUDE: What did you find?
CLAUDE: These have been fired.
VICTOR: At shadows. My nerves got the better of me.
ELIZABETH: What sort of task?
VICTOR: It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
ELIZABETH: What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
VICTOR: So do I.
ELIZABETH: We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
VICTOR: A month at most, that's all I ask. Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake. You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.
VICTOR: You must regain your strength to preside at our wedding. and spoil your grandchildren later on. These are duties you cannot shirk.
VICTOR: We're all safe now. I promise
VICTOR: God forgive me.
HENRY: Whatever they are.
HENRY: I won't bother asking what or why. You wouldn't tell me anyway. I just hope you know what you're doing. .because if this is a repeat of Ingolstadt, I won't be around to pick up the pieces.
CREATURE: I want her.
VICTOR: Why. her?
CREATURE: Her body pleases me.
CREATURE: Materials, remember? Nothing more. Your words.
VICTOR: My words.
VICTOR: The brain stem was destroyed by the hanging. We'll need another. The body looks like it will do, but some extremities are too decayed. They'll have to be replaced. The fresher the
PROSTITUTE: Want some yourself? Or just like to What do you say, lover? I can make it good for you.
CREATURE: I know you can.
VICTOR: What is this?
CREATURE: A brain. Extremities.
VICTOR: This was not taken from a grave.
CREATURE: What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.
VICTOR: No. I draw the line.
CREATURE: You will honor your promise to me!
VICTOR: ( through gritted teeth ) I will not! Kill me now!
CREATURE: That is mild compared to what will come. If you deny me my wedding night. I'll be with you on yours.
VICTOR: No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.
ELIZABETH: Why the change? What about your work?
VICTOR: It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
ELIZABETH: It is
VICTOR: We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
ELIZABETH: Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
VICTOR: ( hesitates ) Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
ELIZABETH: Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
VICTOR: I do. But you must trust me for now.
FATHER: This is not. the grand wedding. I had hoped to give you.
PRIEST: We gather now in the sight of God to witness this man and woman bond their lives in matrimonial vow.
VICTOR: Be especially on your guard. Stay cautious to a fault.
STABLE HAND: Who is this man, sir? How shall we know him?
VICTOR: He is huge and deformed. and quite He killed Master William and sent Justine Moritz to the noose! No hesitation, lads! Shoot the bastard on sight!
CLAUDE: He killed Master William and sent Justine Moritz to the noose! No hesitation, lads! Shoot the bastard on sight!
VICTOR: Are you sure you'll be all right?
HENRY: Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
VICTOR: I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend down together.
HENRY: Only if you'll tell me who he is.
VICTOR: ( hesitates ) I owe you that. Done.
FATHER: .and sees the Creature turn toward him. Father's eyes go wide as his final stroke is triggered. His life ends with a prolonged death-rattle. and a soft exhale. The Creature reaches down, closes his eyes. A tender gesture. A LOUD GASP. The Creature whirls. There stands the priest, dropping his tea to the floor. The Creature sweeps across the room, presses him against the wall.
PRIEST: ( breathless with horror ) You're the Devil himself.
CREATURE: Yes, and I've come to snatch your .unless you tell me where they've
CLAUDE: That was the last ferry. There's nothing else till morning.
VICTOR: Damn it
CLAUDE: We'll ride on ahead and secure you lodging for the night.
VICTOR: Make sure you keep your pistols dry
GUARD #2: They're dry enough. And if they fail, we've others. And if those fail. .we can always gut the bastard.
CLAUDE: Don't worry, sir. You're well guarded. Now why don't you go upstairs to your wife? It's not often a man has his wedding night.
ELIZABETH: You're soaking.
ELIZABETH: Brother and sister no more.
VICTOR: Now husband and wife.
VICTOR: I remember the first time I ever saw you. Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side. So beautiful even then.
ELIZABETH: ( a whisper ) I have been waiting for this ever
ELIZABETH: Open this door for no-one!
VICTOR: Open this door for no-one!
GUARD #2: I saw him in a flash of lightning! He vanished toward the lake!
CLAUDE: Get after him!
CREATURE: Don't bother to scream.
GUARD #3: We lost him.
GUARD #4: Why are those open?
VICTOR: INT - BRIDAL SUITE - NIGHT Elizabeth watches, transfixed, as the huge shadow moves inexorably toward her. Her eyes dart toward the door. She makes a break for it. He catches her halfway across the room, spinning her around by the arm. Her face is lit by the light of the fireplace. The Creature pauses, stunned at her beauty. A moment passes between them. She senses the softening in his heart. She peers at him, trying to understand. Realizing:
ELIZABETH: You don't want to hurt me.
CREATURE: You're more lovely than I could ever have imagined.
VICTOR: .and it changes back in an instant, The Creature snarls. She tries to wrench away. He spins her around so he won't have to look at her in the light, casting her face in shadow. He cooks his arm back and plunges his fist toward her chest with pile-driver force.

CREATURE: I keep my promises.
VICTOR: ( softly ) Oh God. he took her heart. he took her heart from me.
VICTOR: Her eyes flies open as consciousness hits, mouth gaping to draw air but finding fluid in the lungs. She erupts, thrashing in the vat. He clutches her tight, pounding her back to start her breathing, calming the convulsing Creaturess with soft murmured words of tenderness and love as her lungs heave violently to dispel the fluid. He lifts her gently out. Wipes off the muck as she shivers and shakes, spasms easing off. Cleansing her face. Clasping her hand in his. Comfort and strength. Helping her to her feet. Jerky and unsure. Lean on me. Replacing the sheer nightgown on her scarred and naked body, draping it. and finally, exhaustingly, tilting her chin up with his fingers to gaze into her eyes. A whisper:
VICTOR: Say my name.
VICTOR: Elizabeth. Say my name. Say you remember. Say my name.
VICTOR: You must. You must.
VICTOR: Say my name. Say you remember.
VICTOR: Yes. I'll help you remember.
VICTOR: .one-two-three, twirl-two-three.
CREATURE: She's beautiful.
VICTOR: She's not for you.
CREATURE: I'm sure the lady knows her own mind. Doesn't she? Let her decide the proper
VICTOR: Elizabeth, no! Say my name.
ELIZABETH: Vic. tor?
CREATURE: .and she lets out a SHRIEK, a banshee wail from the deepest pits of hell. Screaming at them both. Screaming at herself. She goes berserk, trying to claw her flesh away, trying to find the real Elizabeth underneath the horror, trying to peel it away, clawing at her face. Trying to claw out her own eyes. Victor lunges to restrain her, screaming himself, veering toward final utter madness like strings snapping on a violin. The Creature grabs him, hurls him aside.
CREATURE: GET AWAY FROM HER! SHE'S MINE! SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY NAME! SHE REMEMBERS!
VICTOR: SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY NAME! SHE REMEMBERS!
VICTOR: She spins to face them, holding them breathlessly at bay with the threat of the lamp, twitching from one to the other. But it's not just the lamp, it's the look of sheer loathing in her eyes. Loathing for them for what they've done to her. loathing for herself for what she's become. It turns out the lady does know her own mind. She wants no part of it. or them. Decision made. She crushes the lamp in her bare hands, drenching herself in a cascade of kerosene. WHOOOOSH! She goes up like a blazing matchstick and darts past them, still SHRIEKING, still trying to claw the dead flesh away, pulling off giant flaming pieces of herself as she careens out the door and down the steps, Victor and the Creature racing after her.

VICTOR: You killed her! You killed her!
CREATURE: We killed her.
HENRY: No reaction. For a long moment it seems Victor hasn't heard. He rouses as if from a trance, turn and walks to his pack horse. The animal stands saddled and ready. He starts to mount up, but Henry intercepts him with a restraining hand. Victor snaps a look as if seeing a stranger. and then his features soften.
VICTOR: All that I once loved lies in a shallow grave. By my hand.
HENRY: Let it go.
VICTOR: You should have been my father's son. He would have been so proud.
HENRY: VICTOR! COME BACK!
VICTOR: A year now I've followed him. Perhaps more. Only to arrive at this place. Tired. So very tired. I never did find. whatever it was. I was looking for. and neither will you, my friend. Value life above ambition. or those glittering prizes you seek will crumble to dust in your fingers. as they have in mine. See your loved ones again. I cannot. Rest now.
WALTON: Rest now.
WALTON: A warming wind.
GRIGORI: This ice will break yet. How's our guest?
WALTON: He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil. Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.
GRIGORI: Aye, Captain.
WALTON: Who are you?
CREATURE: He never gave me a name.
CREATURE: You were with him at the end.
WALTON: ( finds his voice ) I was watching.
CREATURE: I was watching.
CREATURE: I longed to be with him. But I wanted his final moments to have peace. I could see you were a friend to him.
WALTON: What is that to you? Evil as you I am as he made me. In his own image.
CREATURE: ( swivels his gaze ) I am as he made me. In his own image.
WALTON: You drove him to his torment.
CREATURE: And he drove me to mine.
WALTON: Then why weep for him?
CREATURE: Would you not? He was father. And mother. We fell from grace together. He from his God. I from mine.
CREATURE: Could we ever have forgiven?
CREATURE: I've never been shown a kindness. Show me one now.
WALTON: What kindness?
CREATURE: Build for him a pyre. Light up the sky with his passing.
PILOT: ( softly )
WALTON: It has a right to bear witness.
WALTON: Stand fast. All of you.
OLD SAILOR: THE BITCH IS BREAKIN' UP!
GRIGORI: ( whips toward Walton )
WALTON: BACK TO THE SHIP!
GRIGORI: LEAVE IT!
LEAVE IT!: .and then the matter is decided for them as a huge rift opens at their feet, running an explosive zig-zag course across the ice, separating them from the torch. They fall back to join the retreat, stumbling after the others, pursued by the ice dissolving at their heels. THE CREATURE watches his last wish for Victor Frankenstein snatched away by God's whim and breaking ice.
NO: He starts forward. Behind him, a detonation of ice throws a massive fist into the air, creating a magnificent halo of cascading water and spinning fragments.
THE NEVSKY: The first wave of fleeing men reach the ship, crowding to the drop-net for salvation, scrambling up the side. WALTON AND GRIGORI stumble along, closing distance to the ship. Walton glances back, amazed to see:
THE CREATURE: racing across the ice, making for the torch, teeth set in a wide grimace of effort. Detonations threaten to swallow him from all sides. Suddenly, things go from bad to worse.
THE NEVSKY: breaks free with an enormous groan, heeling slowly over, triggering massive eruptions in all directions. The crew hang onto the drop-net for dear life. Several men plummet into the icy water. THE CREATURE is propelled by a detonation as if held stepped on a land mine, cartwheeling helplessly through the air to plunge headfirst into the water, huge plates of spinning ice crashing down after him. Gone. WALTON AND GRIGORI are knocked flat as a fissure appears between them. Grigori, dazed, is lifted into the air on a teetering table of ice, desperately trying to scramble back but sliding forward nonetheless, rising up and up, a gaping maw of frigid water yawning wider and wider before him. Walton grabs the back of Grigori's coat and tries to drag him off. but the coat is snatched from his fingers as the ice see-saws forward in a complete flip and slams Grigori thunderously into the drink.
WALTON: THE NEVSKY finishes righting itself, swaying ponderously as she finds honest ocean beneath her hull. Some men are reaching the top of the net, hurling themselves over the gunwale to the deck. Those lower on the drop-net are helping their fellows from the water, hauling them to safety. FRANKENSTEIN'S BIER is now corkscrewing in slow circles on its own ice floe. THE TORCH is drifting on a chunk of ice. Still burning.

WALTON: The first mate breaks surface in the foreground, gasping and strangling for breath, face already turning blue, arms thrashing wildly, dragged down by the now-impossible weight of his own clothing. Walton strains to reach him, nearly going into the water himself. Grigori keeps thrashing and gasping. Dying. He's dying right in front of Walton's eyes.

WALTON: SOMEBODY THROW ME A GAFF!
WALTON: The Creature swivels his gaze. The burning torch is drifting away. He looks grimly back to Walton. Walton beckoning to him. Come. Grab my hand. The Creature swims away, knifing through the water after the torch. Walton turns, drags Grigori gasping to his feet, helps him limp toward the Nevsky across the lurching ice. CREATURE struggles through the water, crushed and battered by ice floes on all sides. Going under. WALTON AND GRIGORI slog grimly on across the disintegrated ice, knee-deep and nearly walking on water. They sink, finding nothing beneath their feet. Lines are thrown down and caught. Walton and Grigori are hauled from the frigid arctic water and hoisted up the side of the ship. The last ones aboard. BURNING TORCH is spinning slowly on its chunk of ice. Bony fingers break the surface of the water. A straining hand. The Creature's eyes rise from the murk. Bleary with exhaustion and cold. He seizes the torch. Raises it high. Swims grimly on.
THE CREATURE: turns his gaze one last time toward Heaven. Eyelids fluttering in near-religious ecstasy. Finding in these last moments the sympathy held so long sought. A whisper:
CREATURE: For God's sake. I will.
WALTON: EXT - ARCTIC - TWILIGHT HIGH AERIAL SHOT. An ocean of broken ice beneath us. The Alexander Nevsky heels gingerly about, corkscrewing through a slow turn toward the open sea as we FADE TO BLACK.
