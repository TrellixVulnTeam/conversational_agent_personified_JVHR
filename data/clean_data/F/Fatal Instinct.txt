SHOOTING DRAFT: FADE IN ON: EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - NIGHT The sultry dampness of a blistering summer hangs in the night air. People stroll the boardwalk looking for a cool breeze. The soft rhythms of a jazz concert float from the band shell.
ARCH: ( interrupts ) Jeez. knock off the chatter, will Just trying to keep you awake, Arch.
NED: Just trying to keep you awake, Arch.
ARCH: I'm awake! Where do you come up with all that crap about women?
NED: It's true. Women are very complex, but if you know how to read 'em. they're an open book. You can always tell the rotten apples from the Are you kiddin'?
ARCH: Are you kiddin'?
NED: I'd stake my career on it. Anybody ever proves me wrong, I'll throw away my badge.
ARCH: Aayyhh. women are trouble.
NED: I used to believe that too. Until I married Lana. Now, she. is a peach.
ARCH: Yeah, well you're a lucky stiff, pal. Ya hold down two jobs. Got a beautiful wife waitin' for ya at home. Everything a guy could ever want, including NO kids.
NED: I'd love to have kids.
ARCH: What?! Rug-rats? Give me a break! Jeez, I hate stakeouts. What makes you think Milo's gonna show up here?
NED: Logic. He knocked off all those banks. He's got cash. He's gonna want to spend it. This is one of the few places that still takes cash. Sooner or later. he's gotta turn up.
ARCH: And how we s'posed to recognize this The "Support Hose Bandit"? When you see him. you'll know him.
NED: The "Support Hose Bandit"? When you see him. you'll know him.
ARCH: These are the best damn Nachos in North America. Maybe the world!
ARCH: I'm empty. I'm gonna get a refill. You want some?
LOLA: Got a light?
NED: Ned pulls out a small flashlight, shines it in her purse. She pulls a cigarette out of the pack, puts it to her lips. her eyes on Ned, sizing him up.
LOLA: How about a match?
NED: No thanks. I have plenty.
LOLA: You really are incredibly stupid, aren't you? I like that in a man.
NED: I'd be insulted, but I know you're You sound so sure of yourself.

NED: Police emergency! I need your car!
OMIT: Sequence omitted from original script.
NED: You take science in high school, I skipped high school, cop!
MILO: I skipped high school, cop!
NED: Then you're probably not familiar with the theory of inverse proportionate explosive dynamics.
MILO: What about it?
NED: If you fire a weapon with the barrel obstructed, the explosive force multiplies by twenty-three point five nine eight and reverses on itself with diametric polarity?
MILO: Yeah. So?
NED: The gun will blow up in your hand. and it won't even scorch my pinkie.
MILO: Ha! That's just theoretical hypothesis. Inverse proportionate explosive dynamics has never been demonstrated conclusively in a laboratory environment.
NED: Oh yeah. Then pull the trigger, smart guy. Let's find out.

LANA: Better watch your tongue, sweetie, or I'll have my husband arrest you.
FRANK: Busy man. Cop and a lawyer. When does he ever find time for you?
LANA: He doesn't. That's why I need you to keep my engine tuned, Frank. Why drive a jalopy when you can have a hot rod?
FRANK: Maybe you should trade him in on a new model.
LANA: I would. if I could make any money on the deal.
FRANK: ( reaches for her ) Want to go for another test drive?
LANA: Pull over and park it, Frank. I'm still under warranty.
NED: Morning sweetheart.
LANA: Uh huh. Want some coffee?
NED: No thanks.

NED: And ya still haven't found the Think I got my finger on it though.
FRANK: ( a leering smile ) Think I got my finger on it though.
NED: I know what he's doing, Lana. I wasn't born yesterday. He's not fixing your car. He's SCREWING you!
NED: YOU are screwing my wife! I can see what your game is, Frank. You open up her hood, poke around in there. squirt some lubrication in. play around with all her parts. then take an old used piston and stick it in. then pull it out. in, out, in, out! Every day! There's no end to it. You just keep coming and COMING!. and the bill just gets bigger and BIGGER!

NED: Laura. do you know where.?
LAURA: ( hands him file ) Right here. The judge decided to skip arraignment and take Milo direct to trial. You're six minutes late, but don't sweat it. You got Judge Allen. He's always eleven minutes
LAURA: I suggest you try Lemming versus Florida, 1956. where the guy jumped in the water and everybody followed.
NED: ( thinks about it ) Yeah. Good idea.
NED: I don't know what I'd do without
LAURA: She sits down on the toilet seat, watching him adoringly as he shaves with an electric razor.
NED: Laura, how long have you worked for Two years, seven months, twenty-three days, nineteen hours. .six minutes and fifty-two seconds. .fifty-three. fifty-four. fifty- five. fifty-six.

LAURA: Never. But that's okay. I don't need a raise. In fact. I was thinking of giving you a rebate on my salary.
NED: Naw. That's okay. You keep it.
LAURA'S HUSBAND: Did we forget something?
LAURA'S HUSBAND: Did we forget something?
END FLASHBACK: BACK TO LAURA SCREAMING out in terror! Ned rushes in, shaking her.
NED: Laura. Laura! What is it?
LAURA: ( coming out of it ) I'm okay, I'm okay. I just get a bit. claustrophobic. in the Maybe we should try some prune juice. Wear the blue one.
NED: Maybe we should try some prune juice. Wear the blue one.
LAURA: Wear the blue one.
NED: Ladies and gentlemen. I ask you. does this look like the face of a
NED: Of course it does. But the question of my client's guilt or innocence is not the issue here today. I'm certain every member of the jury can clearly see that he's guilty!
BLIND JUROR: I can't.
NED: Put yourself in his shoes. Look through his eyes. See the world the way HE sees it!
NED: Things just don't look the same. It's fuzzy. and frightening!
NED: Ladies and gentlemen. Milo Crumley is not the perpetrator here. He is the VICTIM!
NED: Like ALL of us. this man is the unfortunate victim of these tragically difficult economic times. And what does that mean? He can't support his
NED: For God's sake!. He can't even support his own FACE!
JUDGE ALLEN: Mr. Crumley. you cannot chew gum in my courtroom. unless you have enough for everyone. Bailiff. Pass these out.
JUDGE ALLEN: Bailiff. Pass these out.
JUDGE ALLEN: And don't forget the jury.
NED: And so, desperate and broke, with no other options before him, Mr. Crumley went to eleven Savings & Loans and did what any of you would have done. He stole back the money that the S&Ls had stolen from him!
JUDGE ALLEN: ( interrupting ) Mr. Ravine. please approach the
JUDGE ALLEN: You're not running for congress here, so knock off the speeches and quit inciting these brainless morons! Now pick up the pace and wrap this son- of-a-bitch up! Call your first
NED: I call. Detective Ned Ravine.
BAILIFF: Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
NED: I do.
NED: Detective Ravine, at the time of the arrest, did you read the defendant his Miranda rights?
NED: Of course. That's standard procedure.
NED: Are these the cards Officer Brooks used to prompt you while reading Mr. Crumley his rights?
NED: Yeah. These are them. Reading from the cards now. quote "You have the right to remain silent, if you waive that right, anything you say. may be used against you in a court of law." Is that right?
NED: Reading from the cards now. quote "You have the right to remain silent, if you waive that right, anything you say. may be used against you in a court of law." Is that right?
NED: ( back in the chair ) That's right.
NED: ( stands up, announces ) WRONG! The official Miranda warning is. "anything you say CAN be used against you in a court of law." Not "may". "CAN!" ( on the attack ) Don't you know the difference between "can" and "may", Detective? Every school kid knows "can" is a verb that indicates ability to perform, while "may" is a verbal auxiliary indicating the permission to act.
NED: I didn't have time to worry about past participles or interrogative pronouns! I was trying to protect society from a deranged MADMAN! But this ivy league fop.!!!
NED: I have no more use for this witness.
JUDGE ALLEN: Mr. Ravine.
JUDGE ALLEN: I'm dismissing this case on the grounds of improper grammar.
NED: ( jumps up ) But your Honor.!
PROSECUTOR: ( jumps up ) But your Honor.!
JUDGE ALLEN: I know, I know. It's a technicality. But it's the kind of technicality that makes the American legal system what it is today! Court's adjourned!
NED: pushes the door open. It's Lola. She wears a tight white dress, long white gloves and broad-brimmed hat. The hat tips up slowly, revealing her eyes.
LOLA: I waited. You never came back.
NED: I got busy. Here's that paper towel I promised.
LOLA: How'd you get in? The door was locked.
NED: How'd you get in? The door was locked.
LOLA: It's miraculous what a real woman can do. with a bobbie pin.
LOLA: ( offering ) No. thanks. They're bad for ya.
NED: No. thanks. They're bad for ya.
LOLA: Yes, I know. I like things that are bad for me. So. I hear you go both ways.
NED: Only once. It was a fraternity prank. I never saw him again.
LOLA: No, I mean. you're a cop and a Oh. Yeah. Well, there's a lot of scum out there on the streets. but they all deserve a fair and costly
NED: Oh. Yeah. Well, there's a lot of scum out there on the streets. but they all deserve a fair and costly
LAURA: I'll get that.
NED: Oh. Laura. this is, uh.
LOLA: Lola Cain.
LOLA: ( sarcastic ) So lovely to meet you, Laura.
NED: Gotta keep these darn books in their right place or we'll never find the ones we need. Let's see, Q thru M. R thru B. W thru F.
LAURA: It's getting late. I'll give you a ride home, Ned.
NED: I have my car.
LAURA: I'll tow you.
NED: Not today. You don't need to wait. I'll see you tomorrow.
LAURA: I should call someone to fix this.
NED: She instantly spins around, heads back toward the door.
LAURA: I'll call from home.
LOLA: I think I should warn you, Mr. Ravine. I'm not wearing any
NED: Try these on. So. what can I do for you?
NED: So. what can I do for you?
LOLA: I've run across some. papers. and I thought you might be able to tell me what they are. You see, I'm not very experienced when it comes to. papers.
NED: I'll help you Miss Cain, if I'm able. Do you have the. papers. here?
LOLA: No. they're at home. I thought you might stop by.
NED: I'm on duty tonight.
LOLA: Don't they ever give you a night Yeah. Tomorrow.
NED: Yeah. Tomorrow.
LOLA: ( picks up cigarette ) Why don't we meet tomorrow evening
LOLA: I'll let you know where.
NED: ( steps over to her ) What's wrong with my office?
LOLA: Nothing a good interior decorator couldn't fix.
LOLA: Take care of this for me, will ya?
FRANK: I came back for my shower cap.
LANA: Yeah, well you came to the right
LANA: Sit down.
FRANK: Where is he?
LANA: On duty all night. By the time he wraps up his reports, it'll be close to noon tomorrow.
LANA: I was just reading over.
LANA: Take off the hat, Frank.
LANA: I was just reading over my husband's insurance policies. You wouldn't know anything about insurance, would you, Frankie?
FRANK: Yeah, matter of fact, I sell policies part-time. I got half a brain. or didn't you notice?
LANA: I musta had my eye on something else. How about a translation.
FRANK: Standard accident policy. all the usual stuff. blah, blah, blah. The face value is. Wow. Not bad. Three million bucks! And there's a triple indemnity rider.
LANA: Aw, it's just something agents throw in so we can boost the premium. If the policy holder dies under very specific conditions, it pays off three times the face value of the Nine million dollars.?
FRANK: Aw, it's just something agents throw in so we can boost the premium. If the policy holder dies under very specific conditions, it pays off three times the face value of the Nine million dollars.?
LANA: Nine million dollars.?
FRANK: Yeah. but it's a sure bet for the company. Nobody ever collects.
LANA: Why not?
FRANK: Well, like here. it only pays off if he's shot with a pistol, falls from a moving northbound train and drowns in a fresh water stream.
LANA: All three?
FRANK: See what I mean, sweetheart? What are the odds of that?
LANA: It could happen. Suppose it did happen?
FRANK: Then you'd be rich.
LANA: Then we'd be rich.
FRANK: What're you sayin'.?
LANA: We're gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch! And I know exactly how! He has a legal symposium in Santa Barbara this weekend. All we have to do is get him to take the train up instead of driving.
FRANK: How we gonna do that? Didn't you tell me he hates trains?
LANA: That's where you come in, baby. You're gonna rig his car so it doesn't work. That should be no problem for you.
LANA: Then. we give him a lift to the train station. through Dealey Plaza, past the Book Suppository and around the grassy knoll.
FRANK: Isn't that out of our way?
LANA: Move, Frank.
LANA: And pay attention.
LANA: Ten minutes out of the station he'll be standing in the vestibule between cars. trying to avoid a panic attack. Fourteen minutes and ten seconds out, the train crosses the Santa Ynez River. So at thirteen minutes and fifty-four seconds, I shoot him, shove him out the door. he hits the river and drowns. Bingo! A triple play. We're rich!
FRANK: You been thinking about this a lot, haven't you?
LANA: No. It just came to me. I had this image of a big, powerful, throbbing train. plunging into a long, dark, wet tunnel.
NED: Stand over there and shut up!
NED: Watch your mouth, punk! I don't want to hear language like that! Whoa, hold on, hoss! Take it easy. You seem a little tense tonight. What is it?
ARCH: Whoa, hold on, hoss! Take it easy. You seem a little tense tonight. What is it?
NED: Aw. I don't know. I guess it's Lana. It's just. I know she wants to have a baby so bad.
NED: .but I never get to spend any time with her. And when I am home. it's like she's, you know. avoiding
NED: That can't be it. I'm the tenderest guy on the force. Nah. I think she's just afraid she won't be able to get pregnant.
ARCH: What's to be afraid! It's like making breakfast! You bring home the bacon. she's got the eggs. Ya scramble it up. Ba-da-boom ba-da-bing! She's got an omelette in the oven! Why don't you knock off early. go home. It'd be nice for Lana to wake up in the morning and find you there for a change.
NED: Naw. I can't. I got all this Don't worry about that.
ARCH: Don't worry about that.
WILLARD SCOTT: ( on television ) .and Mrs. Prudy Ann Camomile of Delphi, Georgia is one-hundred and thirteen! What a gorgeous hunk of female! Smokes three cigars a day, drinks a straight shot of vodka at bedtime. and still has sex!
NED: Damn birds!

NED: Not again.
NED: Hello, Mrs. Shady.
NED: Laura. check on my insurance. Make sure it's paid up.
MRS. SHADY: Good idea, Mr. Ravine. My son, Max, is getting out of prison tomorrow.
NED: ( checks his watch ) Gee, has it been seven years already?
MRS. SHADY: Seven long, miserable years in the slammer. And he's a bit pissed off.
NED: Well, being locked in a tiny room with no TV can make a guy feel pretty I'm very concerned about him, Mr. Ravine. He said you were a two-bit shyster. and he's going to rip your head off and use it for a bowling
MRS. SHADY: I'm very concerned about him, Mr. Ravine. He said you were a two-bit shyster. and he's going to rip your head off and use it for a bowling

MRS. SHADY: Maybe so. but he said he's going to punch you in the testicles.
MRS. SHADY: .smash your face.
MRS. SHADY: .and decimate your wardrobe. And I wouldn't want that to happen. He's a naughty naughty boy. I just thought I should warn you.
MRS. SHADY: And I wouldn't want that to happen. He's a naughty naughty boy. I just thought I should warn you.
MRS. SHADY: ( to Laura ) Bye for now. ( pauses by desk ) Oh. may I have a cookie?
LAURA: ( at file cabinet )
MRS. SHADY: Thank yooooooooou.
LAURA: Oh my God, Ned.
NED: I hate when she comes to see me.
LAURA: Don't you realize, Ned?. you could be in real danger.
NED: ( sees file ) What's that?
LAURA: Extreme peril. You know, the risk of personal bodily harm.
NED: ( points at file ) No. I mean that.
LAURA: Your insurance file. But the policy's missing. Did you take it home?
NED: I don't think so.
LAURA: Oh, wait a second.
LAURA'S HUSBAND: EXT. BEACH - NIGHT Laura paddles ashore, grasping a little kid's inflatable float ring. She struggles onto the sand and looks out to sea, triumphant. tossing the plastic float aside.
WET!: Laura retrieves a bra and a package of Twinkies from a secret hiding place. and stuffs them into a small brown paper bag. Laura hurriedly mops up her water tracks, then. She uses an industrial buffer to wax the hardwood floor. Laura removes her wedding ring. throws it in the toilet. She reaches for the handle to flush it. hesitates, seeing the "CONSERVE WATER - THIS MEANS YOU!" sticker on the toilet. She reaches into the bowl and retrieves the ring. On the deck, Laura throws the wedding ring toward the ocean. A SEAGULL swoops down, snatching it in mid-air and flies off.
OMIT: Sequence omitted from original script. In the bathroom. the Seagull flies in through the open window, lands on the back of the toilet and drops the ring. into the toilet bowl!
NED: Laura! Are you alright? That was a very long flashback you had.
LAURA: Yes. I know. It's okay. I'm just a little. pre-menstrual.
LAURA: That Lola Cain. "person". stopped by. She left this!
NED: Oh yeah, before I forget. you asked me to take care of this.
LOLA: She takes it. inhales a drag, then lets the smoke flow out through her smile. It flows out for a loooooooooong time! More smoke than she could ever have inhaled. Then.
NED: You smoke too much. It's hot tonight.
LOLA: Is it? I never know. My body heat runs about twenty degrees above
NED: Maybe we should look for a cooler I doubt we'll find one. Even the wind chimes on my porch aren't moving much these days. They keep thudding softly, like dairy cows bumping butts in the night. I go out there expecting to find a cool breeze. but it's just a lot of hot air.
LOLA: I doubt we'll find one. Even the wind chimes on my porch aren't moving much these days. They keep thudding softly, like dairy cows bumping butts in the night. I go out there expecting to find a cool breeze. but it's just a lot of hot air.

NED: .they'll think I'm a putz for passing up a sure thing.
LOLA: ( for all to hear ) Now leave me alone!
NED: Well, here we are. in the dark.
LOLA: I have The Clapper.
NED: You what?
LOLA: My wind chimes.
NED: You know, these would work a lot better if you took them out of the

NED: Why don't we take a look at those. Papers. Right.
LOLA: ( remembering ) Papers. Right.
NED: That's it? These are the. papers?
LOLA: Yes. They're so confusing to me. Can you tell me what they are?
NED: This one's a laundry receipt. and the other one's an expired lottery
LOLA: No. You keep them. as a memento of our time together. I'm so grateful. How can I ever repay you for all you've done?
LOLA: I'm so grateful. How can I ever repay you for all you've done?
NED: Cash would be nice.
LOLA: Isn't there some other way?
NED: I suppose you could wash my car.
LOLA: No, I mean, isn't there something else you want? Something I could give you?
NED: Hey. slow down. there's a speed limit in this state. Sixty-five miles an hour.
LOLA: How fast was I going, officer?
NED: Oh, about a hundred and twenty-three.

NED: ( rapid run-on ) Suppose I do and then we lose the key and while I'm gone to get a duplicate made the house catches on fire and I can't get back to save you because the bridge is washed out and so you die a horrible death toasted like a Polish sausage on a flaming spit! ( shakes his head ) Nah. I better be going.
LOLA: You're not so tough. Last chance.
NED: No thanks. I got a cold shower and a wife who trusts me waiting at home.
LOLA: What's the matter? Don't you want me? It's the way I look, isn't it?
NED: Don't forget to lock up.
LOLA: I knew you'd come back.
NED: ( looking past her ) I forgot my car keys.
LOLA: That's not what you came back for.
NED: Yes it is.
OMIT: Sequence omitted from original script.
LOLA: ( breathless ) .don't. stop.
LOLA: .Oh Ned. please. don't.
LOLA: That takes care of foreplay.
GUARD: It's time, Max.
BLACK FRAME: EXT. FEDERAL PRISON - MORNING Two huge iron doors swing open and a mob of milling REPORTERS rushes forward, surrounding Max Shady. He wears a blue suit just like Ned's. The Reporters have no microphones, but shove their empty hands at Max as if they do. They shout questions.
REPORTER #1: Mr. Shady! What's the first thing you're gonna do now that you're out?
MAX SHADY: Find Ned Ravine. rip his head off and use it for a bowling ball!
REPORTER #2: Are you a good bowler?

MAX SHADY: Yeah. The bastard gave it to me as a gift. to make up for losing my case. Now I'm going to wear it to his friggin' funeral!!
MAX SHADY: INT. LOLA'S HOUSE - MORNING A ceiling fan rotates slowly. a pair of shorts and a nylon stocking hanging from the blades. The house is a wreck! The CAMERA MOVES DOWN to Ned and Lola, both reclining in a big claw-foot bathtub, facing each other, their arms draped lazily over the sides. Ned's eyes are closed. "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" plays on the stereo in the b.g. Lola's hand reaches for an ICE PICK on the floor, raising it up slowly. Then. CLICK!. ignites the cigarette lighter in the handle, touching the flame to the end of her cigarette. She chips away a big chunk of ice from the block in a silver ice bucket beside her. then sensuously rubs the ice across her breasts. Ned winces at the sight of this. Lola smiles at him, then lets the chunk of ice slide into the water. and pushes it between Ned's legs. He cringes, eyes crossed. The familiar repetition of MUSICAL notes from the stereo DRONES LOUDER. grabbing Ned's attention.
NED: That's Madam Butterfly, isn't it?
LOLA: Iron Butterfly. In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida.
NED: ( listening ) Oh yeah, sure. now I can hear it.
LOLA: It tells the sad story of a woman who is rejected by her lover after a brief, but torrid, affair. so she stalks him with an ice pick and stabs him with it more than a thousand Really? I never could understand the
NED: Really? I never could understand the

LOLA: Yes. it was. I should check on my homeowners insurance.
NED: But we can't ever let it happen again. What are you saying, Ned? That you're rejecting me, your lover, after a brief, but torrid, affair?!
LOLA: What are you saying, Ned? That you're rejecting me, your lover, after a brief, but torrid, affair?!
NED: I wouldn't put it exactly like that. It's just that. well, I'm married to a wonderful woman. who is very, very attractive. .not that you aren't very

NED: I'd like to buy a pet.
CLERK: Yeah. For what purpose?
NED: It's a gift. for my wife.
CLERK: Right. They all say that.
NED: She spends a lot of time alone. I thought it might be nice if she had something to keep her company.
CLERK: Yeah. Sure. I bet. How do I know you're not the kind of guy who punches out parakeets? Or takes some poor defenseless animal, throws it in a sack and runs over it with your car five or six times.
NED: I would never hurt an animal.
CLERK: Boy, I would. They're driving me
CRAZY!: Turns and SHOUTS at the noisy birds.
CLERK: They do. She turns back to Ned.
CLERK: Okay. tell me more about this broad you're married to. I like to match people with the pets they deserve.
ARCH: The Gang Member drops the chip. Arch pops it in his mouth, continues singing. The Gang Members join in with harmony. Ned enters in the background, carrying a box with airholes in it. He steps over to his desk, looking at the singing Gang Members, then motions like a choir leader, cutting them off neatly.
NED: ( doubtful ) You do all my paperwork?
NED: Get out of here.
ARCH: And a damn good job, too. One of 'em even did it in Spanish.
ARCH: Hey Ned! Catch this! Friend of yours.

ARCH: Are you kiddin'! He'll do it! The guy's a friggin' looney!

MAX: ( on T.V. ) I'd like to mash his head like a ripe melon.
NED: He gets a little melon-dramatic.

LANA: ( sarcastic ) You could have called. But then, I suppose you were tied up.
NED: ( reflecting back ) Only part of the time.
LANA: I never know when you're coming home, Ned. How can I ever make any plans?
NED: I promise I'll spend more time with you. I know it's been rough, being alone so much. But I'll make it up to you. Maybe we should try again, you know. to have a baby.
LANA: So what's in the box?

JUDGE ARUGULA: The jury will be remanded to the Center For Unclear Thinking in Simi Valley. Court's adjourned.

LAURA: ( hopeful ) What would you think of a married man who gave in to those wild, sensual, raging desires?
NED: What would you think of a married man who gave in to those wild, sensual, raging desires?
LAURA: Oh. wow. golly.
NED: What if, for just one crazy moment, he couldn't resist.? He got knocked for a loop and lost control?
LAURA: ( smiles, eager ) Gosh. that might be okay.
NED: What if a tidal wave of lust crashed over him and he was sucked into a vortex of wild, thrashing urges?
NED: Well. it's not your problem. I'll work it out.
LOLA: ( to Laura ) Like some ice for your drink?
LOLA: Does your wife know you're. "working" late? I certainly hope so, Mr. Ravine.
LANA: Hurry up, darling. You'll be late!
FRANK: ( whispering ) It's all taken care of. When do I knock on the door?
LANA: Wait until I signal you. When I raise the blinds. you knock.

LANA: That's right.
NED: But I just can't get over this stupid nagging fear that.
LANA: Fear! What about our baby, Ned? I don't want to raise a child in a home filled with fear!
LANA: But if you can conquer your fear. maybe I can conquer my fear of having a baby with a father who's fearful. Ned. don't let a train kill our child before it's even conceived!
