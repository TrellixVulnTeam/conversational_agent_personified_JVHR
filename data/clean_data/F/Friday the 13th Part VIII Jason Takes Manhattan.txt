JIM: Well.how do you feel?
SUZY: Ask me in about five minutes. She bites his ear, giggles, then kisses him fully..
JIM: I'm talking about graduation. Being totally free to do whatever we want Her hands slip inside his Pendleton shirt. He sighs.
SUZY: It feels excellent. Her mouth finds his again. After a long kiss, he gently pulls away from her with a teasing smile.
JIM: Gotta throw the anchor over. He leaves the cabin. She slips under the bed sheets.
JIM: glances at the lake, at their eerie surroundings. He feels a chill, heading back inside.
SUZY: What's wrong?
JIM: He starts to pull off his shirt and join her. She senses his anxiety.
SUZY: C'mon, Jimmy. Something's bothering Jim pauses, turning off the mood music.
JIM: It's just that we're right around that old summer camp where all those murders took place. The boat creaks. She's instantly nervous.
SUZY: What murders?
JIM: Never mind, you don't want to know about it.
SUZY: Tell me.
JIM: There's nothing to worry about, Suzy. The guy's dead now, somewhere at the bottom of this lake.if you believe the stories. Let's drop it, okay? He starts to kiss her again. She stops him.
SUZY: What stories? He doesn't want to go into it but Suzy's face insists.
JIM: There was this boy named Jason Voorhees who drowned in Crystal Eight year old JASON is desperately trying to tread water, flailing his arms like a marionette to get attention as he gulps down gallons of mossy lake water.
FLASHBACK: Eight year old JASON is desperately trying to tread water, flailing his arms like a marionette to get attention as he gulps down gallons of mossy lake water.
YOUNG JASON: Hhhhelp..me..I'm drowning.
YOUNG JASON: .And Jason finally slips under the surface for good.
JIM: A bunch of years went by and everybody forgot about it. That's when the murders started.
SUZY: Jason did it.?
JIM': That's what some people thought. But they were wrong.
JIM: His mother blamed the counselors for his death and tried to kill them all. She got her head chopped off by one of We don't need to see this clip.Suzy's reaction is quite So the murders stopped? He gives her a long, penetrating look.
SUZY: So the murders stopped? He gives her a long, penetrating look.
JIM: FLASHBACK MONTAGE ( STOCK ) We're bombarded with QUICK FLASHES of a hockey masked JASON wreaking havoc on assorted teenagers.brandishing everything from hatchets to knives to chainsaws. Just as Jason is about to stab us, CUT BACK TO:
JIM: Legend has it that Jason came back to avenge his mother's death, vowing to kill every teenager from the area. And every now and then, the murders start up again. The boat lurches slightly, tugging at the anchor cable. She's scared: he's frightened himself a little, too.
JIM: Forget about it, Suzy. They're just He brushes her hair back, kissing her cheek gently, finding the nape of her neck again. She closes her eyes, trying to dismiss what he's dredged up. But she can't. Suzy begins to rationalize.
SUZY: We're the last graduating class, Jim's kissing her body, putting Jason behind him.
JIM: I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
SUZY: I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
JIM: So there's no reason for him to come back because there won't be any of us Jim stops, looking her squarely in the eyes.
SUZY: So there's no reason for him to come back because there won't be any of us Jim stops, looking her squarely in the eyes.
JIM: Right. Except that Jason isn't real so none of it matters anyway. She starts to relax, returning his kisses.
SUZY: Did you hear that?
JIM: Hear what? He pulls her back down.
SUZY: C'mon, I'm serious. He knows the mood is broken.
JIM: All right, I'll check it out. He slips on his jeans, exiting the cabin. She pulls the sheet up around her fearfully.
SUZY: No answer. Her heart starts to pound.
SUZY: Again, nothing. She wraps herself in the sheet, moving towards the open door. The ship creaks again.
SUZY: Stop screwing around, Jim. I mean .And just as she reaches the door:
SUZY: stands there in speechless shock, looking down at her mortal wound. But there's no blood.
THE MONSTER: pulls the knife back out, pushing the blade in and out with his hand. It's a retractable rubber knife. JIM pulls off the hockey mask with a huge grin, tossing it She doesn't know whether to hug him with relief or kick him in the balls. He pulls her back onto the bed, EXT. HOUSEBOAT - CLOSE ON HOCKEY MASK sitting dormant on the deck, where Jim tossed it. A SHADOW FALLS ACROSS IT.followed by a SLIMY, DECOMPOSING HAND. The hand grabs it like it's an old friend, pulling it away.
JIM: Gotcha good, baby cakes. She doesn't know whether to hug him with relief or kick him in the balls. He pulls her back onto the bed, EXT. HOUSEBOAT - CLOSE ON HOCKEY MASK sitting dormant on the deck, where Jim tossed it. A SHADOW FALLS ACROSS IT.followed by a SLIMY, DECOMPOSING HAND. The hand grabs it like it's an old friend, pulling it away.
JIM: All right, all right I'm a major And you'll never do it again.
SUZY: And you'll never do it again.
JIM: And I'll never do it again. Forgive She's resisting only for effect. Her legs curl around him, finally giving in.
SUZY: She's resisting only for effect. Her legs curl around him, finally giving in.
SUZY: closes her eyes with pleasure.
SUZY: lets out a broad smile, her eyelids fluttering. They stay open long enough to regard the visitor in the doorway. She tries to choke out a warning to Jim, who's just collapsed himself.
SUZY: He doesn't follow her glance, smiling instead.
JIM: Uh-huh. You must really think I'm an But she continues to stare in horror as:
JASON: raises the spear, taking aim.
JIM: Jim springs off the bed, looking around for anything to defend himself with, grabbing the bedside lamp. He SMASHES IT OVER JASON'S HEAD which has little effect. Jim scrambles to get past him, but Jason LIFTS JIM IN THE
MCCULLOCH: Remember girls, the shuffleboard tournament will start at six p.m. sharp. A non-attendance will restrict your time in port, understood? They nod for his benefit, exchanging derogatory whispers as they head up the ramp. Camera ADJUSTS to find a small parking lot adjacent to the docks, where several cars are just now arriving parents dropping off their high school seniors, hugging them bon voyage.
MILES: You're telling me this boat has a pool with a three meter board?
SEAN: It's a ship and that's right. Plus a disco, gym, game room and a lot more.
MILES: I think I'm gonna blow off New York and just stay on this thing.
MCCULLOCH: You'll do no such thing, Mr. Wolfe. Camera ADJUSTS to reveal McCulloch, holding his list, checking off their names.
MCCULLOCH: Your itinerary has been carefully planned and make no mistake, it will be executed accordingly.
MILES: ( under his breath ) Of course.wouldn't want to risk enjoying this trip. McCulloch gives him a frown. Sean steps up to him Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. Rennie's not coming. He's devastated.
SEAN: Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. Rennie's not coming. He's devastated.
MCCULLOCH: Rennie's not coming. He's devastated.
SEAN: But I thought.
MCCULLOCH: She changed her mind. Let's see.Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are in two-twenty-five. A booming VOICE from above interrupts them:
ANOTHER ANGLE: Standing on the upper deck is a no-nonsense, uniformed Navy man, ADMIRAL ROBERTSON. The captain of the ship. And Sean's father. Sean's sadness about Rennie's absence is immediately replaced with anxiety.
SEAN: Be right up, Dad. He and Miles head up the gangway, both boys giving McCulloch one last glare.
RENNIE: Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
RENNIE: What about not-so-great writers? Rennie smiles self-deprecatingly, Miss Van Deusen grinning back. But Rennie's smiles are few and far between, this one disappearing as she glances out the RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW ( SECOND UNIT ) as the countless gallons of harbor and lake water spread out before her, eery in the bog. A small ROWBOAT grazes across it occupied by two indistinguishable people.
RENNIE: Just felt a little chill. Rennie rubs her arms, faking coldness.
RENNIE: MISS VAN DEUSEN Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody.
RENNIE: That's wonderful, Miss Van Deusen.what's it about? She parks the car, turning off the ignition.
RENNIE: I don't know what to say.
. TAMARA: Are you ready for drugs, sex and rock 'n roll or what, girl? Eva gives her a warning glance, nodding to her left. Eva's MOTHER appears by the passenger door, forcing a smile at Tamara.
MRS. WATANABE: Hello, Tamara.
TAMARA: Hi, Mrs. Watanabe. Just kidding.
MRS. WATANABE: Yes, I'm sure. Embarrassed, Eva hurries to her Mom, rushing a kiss Don't worry about a thing, Mom. I'll have a terrific time and I won't do anything stupid, okay? Before Mrs. Watanabe can squeeze a word in, her daughter is gone. She waves a bittersweet goodbye to her graduate.
EVA: Don't worry about a thing, Mom. I'll have a terrific time and I won't do anything stupid, okay? Before Mrs. Watanabe can squeeze a word in, her daughter is gone. She waves a bittersweet goodbye to her graduate.
MRS. WATANABE: I love you.
TAMARA: I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.
EVA: I'm sure we'll have no problem getting them to party with us.especially with this. Tamara unzips her purse, revealing a baggie filled with fine white powder. Eva looks very nervous.
TAMARA: I'm sure we'll have no problem getting them to party with us.especially with this. Tamara unzips her purse, revealing a baggie filled with fine white powder. Eva looks very nervous.
TAMARA: It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best.
EVA: He bought you that?
TAMARA: More or less. It's part of my college She grins coquettishly, walking on. Camera HOLDS on the calm, foggy harbor.where the faint image of a HOUSEBOAT is aimlessly drifting into port.
MCCULLOCH: You can stop right there, Miss Mason. He motions the others onward. Busted. Tamara instantly hands Eva her drug-filled purse, paralyzing Eva.
MCCULL40CH: Only graduating seniors are allowed on this cruise.
TAMARA: What are you talking about?
MCCULLOCB: You never turned in your final biology project, so I've had your diploma You can't do that.
TAMARA: You can't do that.
MCCULLOCH: It's already been done. Congratulations on the 3.9 average, Miss Watanabe. You're in stateroom two- Eva smiles awkwardly, reaching for her luggage, stalling to see what happens with Tamara.
TAMARA: Look, Mr. McCulloch, I got in a car accident yesterday and missed our appointment. It's okay, no big deal, just a bruised arm. .so I brought my project along today. It's in my suitcase. Really. He looks at her suitcase, not buying a word of this.
EVA: She's telling the truth, Mr. McCulloch. I saw her pack it. He's surprised to hear this.and so is Tamara.
MCCULLOCH: All right. But if it mysteriously disappears en route, I'll have you sent back home the minute we dock. She grabs her purse back from Eva, quickly moving on before he changes his mind. Their voices become whispers.
TAMARA: She grabs her purse back from Eva, quickly moving on before he changes his mind. Their voices become whispers.
TAMARA: A major prick.
EVA: What are you going to do?
TAMARA: Improvise, of course.
MCCULLOCH: Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.
MCCULLOCH: Let's go we're running two minutes Charles, there's someone else coming along too. He stops, following her glance. His face tightens.
ANOTHER ANGLE: Rennie is walking toward them with a small suitcase, her dog Toby striding next to her. She walks up to him, starts to say something, then decides against it. Rennie heads up the gangway. HOLD on McCulloch and Miss Van Deusen. He's livid.
MCCULLOCH: You have no right.
MCCULLOCH: She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life.
MCCULLOCH: I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.
RENNIE'S PUPILS: contract, her blood pumping faster. Then she hears a
YOUNG JASON: Hhhhelp me..I'm drowning.
RENNIE: leans back in terror, falling into Miss Van Deusen.
RENNIE: I just got a little dizzy. I'm fine. She continues up the ramp. HOLD on Miss Van Deusen, watching her go, somewhat troubled by it. RACK to McCulloch below her, also watching. Extremely concerned.
RENNIE: continues along the starboard side, not risking another glance overboard. She passes an older, very deranged DECK HAND, mopping the deck. HOLD on him, his bloodshot eyes following her like a crazed raven.
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON: ( checking watch ) Let's take in the brow.
CHIEF ENGINEER: Yes Sir. Take in the gangway and single up all SEAN and MILES enter the room; Sean gets a glance from his Dad. Miles is very impressed with the bridge.
SEAN: Hello, Dad.
MILES: Hey, Admiral Robertson. Love your She's a beauty, isn't she? I should've retired from the Navy ten years ago.
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON: She's a beauty, isn't she? I should've retired from the Navy ten years ago.
MILES: You've really been generous to give us this cruise. I know I speak for everybody on board. Everybody.with the possible exception of Sean. He avoids eye contact with his father.
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON: Hell, there's just twenty or so of you we only need a skeleton crew and it's a pleasure to sail her anyway. By the way, congratulations on winning the intramural diving championships, Miles. I'm sure you made your old man Admiral Robertson gives his own son a glance; maybe Sean should think about doing the same.
CHIEF ENGINEER: Have you decided on your departure protocol, Admiral?
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON: Actually, I thought I'd leave the honors to my son.
SEAN: Dad, I don't think.
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON: ( to Chief Engineer, ignoring Sean ) Relinquishing command of the Princess Ruby to Captain Sean Robertson. Sean has no say in the matter. Miles can feel his friend's nervousness as well.
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON: But before you take the helm, take He tosses Sean a wrapped box. Sean opens it. Inside is a navigational computer the size of a calculator, sitting next to a rusty old sextant.
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON: Something old and something new. I used the sextant when I was your age, but now they have these goddamn computers to do all the work for you.
CHIEF ENGINEER: ( to Sean ) Have you decided on a plan of departure, Captain? Sean's nervous. He eyes the Omega, quickly glancing at the LORAN, briefly referring to the navigational chart.
SEAN: How about if we start up the forward engines and come around. 180 Aren't you forgetting something? Sean looks flustered. Admiral Robertson storms to a large button, pressing it three times, piercing the air with three long blasts of the ship's horn. It underscores his frustration.
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON: Aren't you forgetting something? Sean looks flustered. Admiral Robertson storms to a large button, pressing it three times, piercing the air with three long blasts of the ship's horn. It underscores his frustration.
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON: We're in foggy weather! Send out the international maritime signal that a vessel is backing down, followed by a security broadcast warning other He shoves the mike out at Sean, but he doesn't grab it, leaving the bridge, humiliated. There's an awkward moment for Miles, unable to find any appropriate words. He exits as well. Admiral Robertson stares out the bridge window, saddened and frustrated. It wasn't supposed to go this EXT. DECK - ON SEAN as he continues away, his retreat blocked by the DECK HAND. The crazy old man pierces a dead serious stare at This voyage is doomed.
DECK HAND: This voyage is doomed.
SEAN: Yeah, tell me about it. Sean sidesteps him, moving on.
SEAN: Hi, Sean.
RENNIE: Hi, Sean.
SEAN: I heard you weren't coming.
RENNIE: ( glances at Toby ) We changed our minds. Sean pats her dog. There's an awkward pause.they are obviously in the early stages-of a relationship. Sean reaches into his coat pocket, bringing back a small necklace-sized box.
SEAN: I got you a present.
RENNIE: But I didn't get you one.
SEAN: Forget it. It's a dumb little thing Rennie opens it up, exposing a petite silver necklace with a Statue of Liberty pendant on it. She's touched.
RENNIE: Sean.it's beautiful. Sean takes it from her, snapping it around her neck.
SEAN: I thought maybe we could hike to the top of the Statue when we got there, if you felt like it. It's supposed to be 22 stories tall.
RENNIE: I'd love to.
SEAN: I guess I'll see you later. Sean leaves. McCulloch steps up to Rennie, pointing out to the foggy sea. Her respiration increases as she psyches herself up to look.
MCCULLOCH: There's a storm predicted tonight. Rennie looks at the ocean, forcing herself not to turn You're making a big mistake, Rennie. It's not too late to put you back on I'm staying.
MCCULLOCH: You're making a big mistake, Rennie. It's not too late to put you back on I'm staying.
RENNIE: I'm staying.
MCCULLOCH: If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of.
RENNIE: She didn't push me into coming.
MCCULLOCH: Why are you doing this to yourself?
RENNIE: I don't even know why I'm afraid, Uncle Charles. I can't even remember when it started. Don't you think it's time I found out and got over it? He takes a measured pause.
MCCULLOCH: Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it.
RENNIE: I'm staying. He's not going to change her mind.
WAYNE: Too cool, J.J. Your parents came She pops out the guitar cable from her practice amp.
WAYNE: Sure.but I gotta shoot some shockumentary footage first. He avoids eye contact when he says it. She gives him a Man, don't tell me you're still trying to scam on Tamara. His non-answer means yes. J.J. walks over to him, grabbing his cheeks, shaking them like jello.
WAYNE: She's sexy.
WAYNE: I'll catch you later.
JASON'S FACE: appears for an instant through the vapor, then vanishes.
JASON: emerging from a cloud of vapor like her worst nightmare.
JASON: swings the guitar downward and buries it in J.J.'s skull.
RENNIE: What do you think.time for some personal experiences to fuel our The dog's eyes blink, but no more than that.
RENNIE: I agree. Rennie moves to her closet, finding a silk blouse and some black satin pants.
REVERSE ANGLE: Nobody is there, her porthole window empty. But there's something surreal about the window.
RENNIE: feels her throat catch with terror and an instant later:
DOG TOBY: begins to bark vociferously, rushing to her cabin door, scratching to get out.
RENNIE'S EYES: are distracted to Toby for a second; when she looks back at the porthole, she sees:
RENNIE: snaps out of it, moving to the door, where her dog is frantically clawing with his fur up.
RENNIE: Okay Toby, calm down. She's talking to herself as much as the dog. Rennie closes the curtains on her window, then steps to her door. She swings the door open for Toby.and exposes an empty hall. Toby scrapes his way out of the room, dashing off down the hall, snarling.
EVA: I'm not sure we're supposed to be here, Tamara. A couple of skinny boys wearing only towels walk by. But Tamara doesn't notice them, her face pressed up against the glass, watching Julius.
TAMARA: Is that a muscular bod or what? Tamara puts on a sexy smile. The other boxer sees her instead, instantly distracted. Julius lays him out with a left-right-left combination. The onlookers applaud. Julius pulls out his mouthpiece, giving Tamara a wicked He's undefeated, you know that? Julius is the only senior I'd even consider doing it with. If he wasn't black, that is.
TAMARA: He's undefeated, you know that? Julius is the only senior I'd even consider doing it with. If he wasn't black, that is.
EVA: ( awkward ) My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.
TAMARA: My stepmom couldn't care less, but Daddy would have a shit fit. He might even pay some attention to Tamara quickly puts up her veneer again, spotting Gorgeous guy at ten o'clock. Look Both girls slip into instant sultry as a CREW MEMBER in his mid-twenties passes them, wearing a tool belt. Very masculine. He gives the girls a pleasant smile. Tamara turns around to check out his back side.
TAMARA: Gorgeous guy at ten o'clock. Look Both girls slip into instant sultry as a CREW MEMBER in his mid-twenties passes them, wearing a tool belt. Very masculine. He gives the girls a pleasant smile. Tamara turns around to check out his back side.
TAMARA: I think it's time for some recreational activity, girl.
EVA: Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck it might be kinds cool.
TAMARA: You're joking, right? She wasn't, but Eva tries to act like she was. Tamara walks on, Eva following.
MCCULLOCH: Have you seen my niece anywhere?
WAYNE: Yeah, motivating downstairs, I think. What's the problem, Mr. McCulloch?
MCCULLOCH: Senior predictions started five minutes ago and she hasn't shown up.
WAYNE: Some of us don't want our futures In your case I'm sure that's true. He brushes past Wayne angrily.
MCCULLOCH: In your case I'm sure that's true. He brushes past Wayne angrily.
TAMARA: The night time is the right time. Tamara hands the straw to Eva.
EVA: ( nervous ) No thanks.
TAMARA: What? Don't be a lightweight.this is top dollar toot.
EVA: It's not that, it's just that. It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything.
TAMARA: You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
EVA: ( a pause ) I guess not.
TAMARA: Do you realize how many people would kill to be sitting here right now? Come on, it's grad night. You've got your whole life to be uptight. Eva takes the straw.
TAMARA: Is that unbelievable or what? Tamara giggles, getting ready to tap out another line. But the snickering stops upon the sound of APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS. They both look up, every muscle tensing with fear as:
RENNIE: appears from the shadows, just as startled to see them. It's not Jason at all. Rennie can't help noticing the cocaine, trying hard to ignore it.
TAMARA: Jesus, you scared the hell out of us.
RENNIE: Have you seen my dog? I think he came this way.
TAMARA: No, we haven't. Care for a hit?
RENNIE: No thanks. Rennie continues on. After she's gone.
TAMARA: A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll narc on us.
EVA: I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.
TAMARA: Nobody related to McCulloch can be Tamara puts the straw to her nose.
RENNIE: No reply. She walks on, turning down the left hallway. but camera turns down the right hallway. Suddenly JASON REVEALS HIMSELF, quietly stepping from the GAME ROOM. He's holding a pool cue, which he proceeds to snap in half, providing a splintery sharp shaft.
TAMARA: Oh yeah. Ready to party and then some. She rolls up her baggie, stuffing it into her purse.
REVERSE ANGLE: They are facing McCulloch.
MCCULLOCH: What are you doing in here?
TAMARA: He eyes the broken mirror. He wasn't born yesterday.
MCCULLOCH: Are you girls using drugs?
EVA: Do you think I would use drugs, Mr. McCulloch? We were just exploring the He doesn't want to believe Eva is a druggie. But Tamara is a different matter. He levels his eyes on her.
MCCULLOCH: I'11 be coming around your stateroom in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss Mason. You'd better have your biology project ready or I'm phoning your They're out of town.
TAMARA: They're out of town.
MCCULLOCH: Then I'll make sure you remain on board while your classmates see the He's gotten to her with that one. McCulloch storms away.
EVA: What are you going to do?
TAMARA: Relax, I've got McCulloch covered. but that little narcing bitch niece of his is a different matter. Rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid of the water.
SPLASH!: as a body pierces the surface of the deck swimming pool. It's MILES, having just completed a dive from the high board. Miss Van Deusen and several others stand at poolside, giving him some applause.
MILES: A half-twist short. I'll hone that dive yet. He swims to the side, leading us to a view of Rennie. She's very cautious about getting too close to the pool edge as she approaches Miss Van Deusen.
RENNIE: Have you seen my dog anywhere?
TOBY: rears back with teeth bared, but:
THE BODY: is quite dead: Toby is snarling at the corpse of the TEENAGE BOXER who lost his bout against Julius. He's still in his boxing shorts.BUT JASON'S SPLINTERY POOL
RENNIE: ( lying ) Yeah.a lot.
RENNIE: ( a pause ) There's something I haven't told .But before she can begin the next sentence, Rennie is shoved from behind.
WATER ANGLE: as she SPLASHES INTO THE POOL'S DEEP END.
TAMARA: Wow, sorry.
RENNIE: flounders at the surface, nobody realizing the terror she's experiencing. She's too scared to even cry for MISS VAN DEUSEN isn't looking at Rennie, her attention on admonishing
TAMARA: It was an accident, I swear. Eva avoids eye contact, feeling awful. Sean comes walking up, seeing Rennie.
SEAN: What happened? Rennie, are you okay?
SEAN: realizes she's in trouble. He immediately dives in after her, pulling her to the pool's edge, where Miss Van Deusen helps to lift her out.
TAMARA: That was truly excellent.
EVA: ( feels like shit ) Time to check out the waiters.
TAMARA: Time to check out the waiters.
EVA: I think I'll pass. See you later, But.wait a minute! Eva walks away. Tamara acts angry, but deep down she's Some friend you are.
TAMARA: But.wait a minute! Eva walks away. Tamara acts angry, but deep down she's Some friend you are.
TAMARA: Some friend you are.
RENNIE: I can't swim.
RENNIE: It's not that simple.
RENNIE: ( long pause ) Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him. The teacher didn't expect this, taking a thoughtful When did this start?
RENNIE: About four years ago.at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding After your parents passed away? Rennie nods somberly.
RENNIE: No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
ANOTHER ANGLE: as McCulloch rushes over to Rennie, seeing that she's soaked. He's livid.
MCCULLOCH: Oh, I can see that. You've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids, Miss Van Deusen.
RENNIE: It wasn't her fault. He gets Rennie to her feet just as Sean runs back with a towel. McCulloch grabs it from him, wrapping it around his niece, facing both Miss Van Deusen and Sean.
MCCULLOCH: Stay away from her.both of you. He starts to lead her away. The crazy DECK HAND blocks their path, slipping his flask away.
DECK HAND: He's come back and you're all going to Rennie gazes at the Deck Hand, then back at McCulloch.
RENNIE: Just.leave me alone. She pulls away from him, hurrying off, confused and frightened. McCulloch's retinas pierce the Deck Hand with scorn. He checks his watch, then storms off.
MCCULLOCH: I'm in no mood for any more stall tactics, Miss Mason. Where is your final project?
REVERSE ANGLE: as Tamara fills a pair of champagne glasses with a bottle of Dom Perignon. She's wearing a full body robe.
TAMARA: Wouldn't you like a glass of champagne first, Charles? He's about to lose his temper. McCulloch steps closer.
MCCULLOCH: Where did you get that alcohol?
TAMARA: I packed it. Just for us.
MCCULLOCH: That's it. You're not setting foot off this ship until we return home.
TAMARA: But I haven't even shown you my biology project. Tamara unties her robe. PAN DOWN to the floor with it as it softly piles at her bare feet.
TAMARA: Take a closer look, Charles. I want to make sure I labeled all my organs EXT. TAMARA'S STATEROOM - STALKING POINT OF VIEW as we approach her door, still cracked open from McCulloch's entrance. We get there just in time to see Tamara slip her arms around McCulloch, planting her lips on his, pressing her nubile flesh up against his stiffly starched shirt.
MCCULLOCH: Oh, you've done it now. Not only are you going home, I'll see to it that you spend next year back in a high school classroom! He storms for the door, swinging it open, coming face to face with:
WAYNE: who casually lowers his camcorder.
TAMARA: I don't think so, Mr. McCulloch. Did you get anything good? His eyes are unable to leave her nakedness.
WAYNE: Oh yeah. She quickly slips on her robe again, all business. McCulloch realizes what has just transpired.
MCCULLOCH: You'll never get away with it. And you can forget about ever attending any film school. You're both going to be very, very He storms off. Wayne looks very, very nervous. Tamara steps over to him, cuddling up.
TAMARA: Relax, Wayne. He won't risk doing a Can I have the tape? He pops the eject button, absently handing it over. Wayne steps into her room, nervous and excited to be there. He lifts the glass of champagne she poured for McCulloch.
WAYNE: This is going to sound supremely lame.but I've had the major hots for you since our sophomore year, Tamara. He gulps down the fizz. She forces a smile, stashing the incriminating videotape.
TAMARA: That's sweet, Wayne. Look, I'd love to chat but I'm really pressed for time. Let's try to get together later, okey- But I thought.
WAYNE: But I thought.
TAMARA: Thanks for the camerawork. And out he goes, the door shut in his face. Wayne stands outside her room, realizing he's a major chump.
WAYNE: Wayne, you're an asshole. He despondently exits.
RENNIE: It's not real, it's not real.
ANOTHER ANGLE: as Tamara reaches for her robe, slipping it on. Her body paint has been washed off. She steps from the shower, glancing in her vanity mirror AND SEEING THE REAL JASON REFLECTED IN IT. Tamara spins around, looking face to face with JASON IN HER BATHROOM. Just as she SCREAMS:
TAMARA: Please.please don't. Jason raises the shard above her and just as she
SEAN: It's okay.you're going to be okay.
RENNIE: I want to go home. I want off this After a moment.
SEAN: Me too. Let's go talk to my Dad. He puts his arm around her, leading her toward the INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT as wind and rain pummel the bridge window.. Admiral Robertson turns to his Chief Engineer.
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON: Let's kick in the stablilizers, Mr. Carlson, and get the seas off the quarter. These kids are in for one hell of a storm.
CHIEF ENGINEER: Yes Sir. Activating comfort cruise The Chief Engineer moves to a bank of toggle switches, flipping a row of them.
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON: gets a reflective look in his weary eyes.
CHIEF ENGINEER: Nineteen months.
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON: A tremendous age. Take some advice from a salty old man: don't push him too hard. The Chief Engineer nods with a sympathetic smile as the Admiral steps off the bridge, onto the stormy deck, contemplating the sea. The Chief Engineer moves to the radio/intercom console. He lifts a telephone, punching in a three digit number. PUSH IN TIGHT ON HIS FACE.
CHIEF ENGINEER: This is the bridge. Approaching weather suggests we secure the main deck and. His sentence is sharply cut off, his head jerking from excruciating, instant pain. His mouth contorts with words no one will ever hear as he stares into the face of:
JASON: holding the opposite end of the harpoon. He shoves it forward with one more staccato jerk and:
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON: returns to the bridge as LIGHTNING flashes outside.
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON: Better have them doublecheck the lifeboat stations as well. Admiral Robertson stops cold upon the sight of Mr. Carlson. He hurries over to him, kneeling down, freezing as a pair of MUDDY FEET ENTER FRAME. Admiral Robertson bends his neck upwards to face:
JASON: hovering over him, now clutching one of the scaling INT. BRIDGE CORRIDOR - NIGHT as Sean and Rennie walk up the corridor leading to the
RENNIE: Can he really take us home?
SEAN: Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you.
RENNIE: What about you?
SEAN: If I go with you, he'll never speak to me again. But I'm never going to live up to his expectations anyway.so maybe it's the right thing to do. He's made a big decision. Sean takes her hand as they walk on.
SEAN: knocks on the bridge door. No answer. He's confused. He pushes the door open but something is blocking it. Sean puts his weight into it, shoving hard.
SEAN: Oh Jesus.Dad?? Sean looks over at the helm.where his father is still sitting in the swivel chair, his back to them. Silent. Sean sidesteps the Chief Engineer's corpse, moving toward his father as Rennie remains frozen in shock.
SEAN: reaches out and swivels the chair around. It is his father BUT HIS THROAT HAS BEEN SLIT. Sean staggers backwards, uncomprehending, his senses overloaded. We MOVE with him until he's backed into Rennie, clutching onto him tightly.
SEAN: He's.he's dead.
MCCULLOCH: I thought I told you to stay away from Where is she?
MCCULLOCB: ( accusing ) That's a very good question and I'd appreciate an answer. A LOUD BUZZER blares out of an intercom speaker next to their heads, causing the teachers to both jump. Sean's unsteady voice immediately follows.
WAYNE: Miles have you seen J.J.? She was supposed to be jamming down in the power room but. Miles gestures for him to be quiet, listening very Repeat, this is an emergency.
JULIUS: What the fuck is this? The others shrug, concerned.
RENNIE: What is happening??? Sean regains his balance, moving to the computer console, looking at the OMEGA and LORAN like he's never seen them I don't know.we've gone off course or something.
SEAN: I don't know.we've gone off course or something.
RENNIE: What do you mean??? Another wave hammers the bow. She's in a state of awful I don't know what I mean! All's I know is that there's no one guiding this ship anymore. Sean is starting to lose it. The fear of the ocean guiding her, Rennie rushes to him, gripping and shaking Can't you call for help?? Sean tries to get a grip and assess the situation, pacing I think so. But we have to lower the anchors so we don't drift any Where are they?
SEAN: I don't know what I mean! All's I know is that there's no one guiding this ship anymore. Sean is starting to lose it. The fear of the ocean guiding her, Rennie rushes to him, gripping and shaking Can't you call for help?? Sean tries to get a grip and assess the situation, pacing I think so. But we have to lower the anchors so we don't drift any Where are they?
RENNIE: Can't you call for help?? Sean tries to get a grip and assess the situation, pacing I think so. But we have to lower the anchors so we don't drift any Where are they?
SEAN: I think so. But we have to lower the anchors so we don't drift any Where are they?
RENNIE: Where are they?
SEAN: The bow.front of the ship. There's a hoist on each side that lowers them She starts to exit.
SEAN: I didn't mean for you to go!
RENNIE: Just radio for help, okay??? She hurries out the door, working on terror-induced adrenaline. Sean rushes to the radio console, depressing the keying button, speaking into the mike.
SEAN: Mayday, mayday, mayday.
ANOTHER ANGLE: as JULIUS arrives with the others from the locker room. They react to the dead bodies while Sean continues at the No response. WAYNE and MILES rush in.
SEAN: Please.can anybody out there hear No response. WAYNE and MILES rush in.
MILES: Sean, what's going on? Then he sees the corpses. He needs no further answer.
WAYNE: Jesus Christ. He's too scared to even videotape it. Sean is bombarded with questions as he tries to figure out the radio.
JULIUS: Who did this, man?
WAYNE: Is the radio even working??
MILES: Isn't there some international S.O.S. thing you can do???
SEAN: ( suddenly remembers ) Channel 16.the distress frequency. ( dialing knob ) Mayday, mayday, mayday.this is the Princess Ruby. Please, somebody EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT ( STOCK ) as a COAST GUARD CUTTER tracks through stormy seas.
SEAN: The Captain and Chief Engineer. they've been.they're dead.
SEAN: I.I don't know.
SEAN: RADIO OFFICER ( FILTERED V.O. ) The LORAN has a digital printout of your latitude and longitude. Give me the coordinates and we'll be there as quick as we can. Sean hurries to the LORAN, reading the numbers.
SEAN: I've got the numbers.
SEAN: Hello? Are you there?? No response. A lump sinks into everyone's throat.
MCCULLOCH: I demand to know what is going on.
MCCULLOCH: Where's the radio?
SEAN: DECK HAND ( O.S. ) You're all going to die. All heads spin as the deranged DECK HAND treads out from a shadowy corridor.
DECK HAND: You're the last ones. He's come back for you.
MCCULLOCH: What are you talking about? The Deck Hand takes a final swig from his flask, dropping it with unsteady hands.
DECK HAND: Jason Voorhees. There is a collective, disconcerting silence triggered by the infamous name.
MCCULLOCH: You're insane, old man. Jason Voorhees has been dead for over thirty years.
DECK HAND: He walks this ship, here and now.
MCCULLOCH: A killer walks this ship indeed. And it's certainly none of us. The crazed old man gets his drift. Everyone looks at him suspiciously. McCulloch grabs a SCALING KNIFE off the wall, taking a step towards him.
DECK HAND: You're the one who's insane!! The raving man flees back the way he came. McCulloch raises the flare gun; Miss Van Deusen grabs McCulloch's arm, stopping him.
MCCULLOCH: That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded. It's no coincidence.
MCCULLOCH: Walking corpses are not real!
JULIUS: Yeah, well these dead bodies are sure enough real. I say we regroup and find this motherfucker before he finds us. There's a murmur; it makes sense.
MCCULLOCH: You'll do no.such thing and watch your mouth, young man! I'm in charge here! They all look at McCulloch defiantly.
JULIUS: School's out, McCulloch. Let's go. Julius walks off the bridge; all the seniors follow except Sean.
MCCULLOCH: Christ.where's Rennie??
SEAN: She's.she's dropping the anchors. I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if.
MCCULLOCH: What?? You sent her out there with a murderer running around loose??
EVA: What's going on? I heard on the P.A. system that.
WAYNE: ( interrupting ) The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
EVA: She knows the legend as weld as everybody else. Wayne nods gravely, moving to catch up with the others. Eva rushes up to him again.
EVA: Have you seen Tamara?
WAYNE: No. And I'm not losing any sleep over But she might be in trouble.
EVA: But she might be in trouble.
WAYNE: So what else is new? Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise up it's not hip to be her friend.
EVA: I don't care about being hip anymore. She means it. Wayne nods with understanding.
WAYNE: I'm sorry, but I've gotta find J.J. He hurries on.
RENNIE: She turns, catching a glimpse of her dog running down the side of the deck. Rennie leaves the hoist, going after JASON'S POINT OF VIEW through the crack in the door, watching Rennie unexpectedly take off. He's about to move after her when ha hears:
EVA: JASON'S POINT OF VIEW moving down the same corridor, catching a glimpse of Eva before she turns a corner and disappears.
EVA: ( no response ) I just want to talk with you. She steps into Tamara's room and we go in with her. The quarters are empty. Eva stands there for a beat, confused and scared. She's about to leave when a CREAKING SOUND causes her to look back at:
EVA: shrieks, running back out the door.
EVA: decides this is the wrong place to be. She moves for the corridor again and:
JASON: appears on the corridor steps for a brief second. The spotlight goes black, then flashes on again. Now he's backs away, sliding along the edge of the dance floor like she's on a building ledge. Chaser lights and mirror balls fondle her body as she moves as far away from the point where she last saw him. But:
EVA: backs away, sliding along the edge of the dance floor like she's on a building ledge. Chaser lights and mirror balls fondle her body as she moves as far away from the point where she last saw him. But:
JASON: illuminates only ten feet from her, a crimson strobe assaulting his hockey mask. She's on a collision course with him.
EVA: whirls dizzily to the center of the dance floor upon the sight of him. Camera SPINS with her in 360 degree arcs, PUSHING IN on her face.
EVA: stops, looking everywhere.
RENNIE: Toby? Where'd you go? No sign of her dog. She remembers her mission, heading to the anchors again.
RENNIE: is oblivious as she reads the directions above the INSERT - HOIST LEVER ( SECOND UNIT ) as Rennie's hand grabs it, shoving it forward.
RENNIE: remains in the hoist box, making certain it is operating correctly. A second later, we see the fleeting outline of a HUMAN SHAPE appear behind her.
REVERSE ANGLE: She's facing MCCULLOCH. He immediately reaches past her, yanking the lever back to its center position, and:
MCCULLOCH: You had me worried to death!
RENNIE: But Sean said.
MCCULLOCH: I'm the one you should be listening to! Do you think dropping an anchor in the middle of a storm makes any sense She tries to find some defense, but McCulloch leads her off before any wards come forth.
JULIUS: I managed to scrounge this shit from the game room and hallways. Grab what you want. Wayne takes one of the rifles; Miles grabs the axe.
WAYNE: What are you taking, Julius?
JULIUS: ( flexes fists ) ( dead serious ) We're talking the possibility of Jason Voorhees here. Julius pauses. He's not stupid.
WAYNE: ( dead serious ) We're talking the possibility of Jason Voorhees here. Julius pauses. He's not stupid.
JULIUS: Nothin' but this gun. He reaches down, picking up the other rifle. And they INT. STATEROOM HALLWAY/RENNIE'S ROOM - NIGHT as McCulloch guides his niece down the hallway, swinging her door open.
RENNIE: Can't we at least talk about it?
MCCULLOCH: I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.
RENNIE: But what about the drowning boy I've been seeing? He avoids eye contact. McCulloch takes her hand, ushering her across the threshold. She's standing inside her room now; he's in the hallway.
MCCULLOCH: Whatever you've been.imagining. has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees. I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about.
RENNIE: I'm not staying in my room, Uncle This isn't a request. He closes the door on her face, pulling out a key, locking the dead bolt. She pounds on it from the other Uncle Charles! He ignores her, briskly walking away.
MCCULLOCH: This isn't a request. He closes the door on her face, pulling out a key, locking the dead bolt. She pounds on it from the other Uncle Charles! He ignores her, briskly walking away.
WAYNE: J.J. you down here?
CLOSER ANGLE: as Wayne carefully lets his light guide him down the precarious walkway. An unexpected blast of steam scares the crap out of him, causing him to stumble.
WAYNE: lies helplessly on the metal grid work, realizing his bleak predicament has just been squared. He pulls himself to a standing position again.
WAYNE: We got a major problem, Wayne.
WAYNE: takes another step, almost tripping on a set of stairs leading down to the next level. And when he arrives WAYNE'S BLURRY POINT OF VIEW .A LARGE FIGURE STEPS OUT, HOLDING WHAT APPEARS TO BE A instantly raises the rifle and FIRES.
WAYNE: instantly raises the rifle and FIRES.
WAYNE: stands there, breathing some relief. He gets an idea, looking through his camcorder eyepiece. Wayne begins to adjust the eyepiece diaptor.
WAYNE: slowly lowers his camera as his heart rises into his He raises his camcorder again, hoping a second view will reveal a dead Jason rather than this young man.
WAYNE: He raises his camcorder again, hoping a second view will reveal a dead Jason rather than this young man.
WAYNE: screams, blindly running as fast as he can. He trips, picking himself up, stumbling down the catwalk stairs. Wayne makes it about ten feet before he stumbles over something, bringing with it a harsh strum from an
WAYNE: No no no.
REVERSE ANGLE: Wayne's hands are touching J.J.'S BLOODY FACE, A LARGE CRACK IN HER SKULL. He doesn't have time to scream or cry hoists him off of J.J.'s body and flings him into:
JASON: hoists him off of J.J.'s body and flings him into:
SEAN: ( very worried ) I don't know.
SEAN: ( beat ) We could hit a reef, collide with another ship.we could be out here for weeks before anybody spotted us. They are suddenly jolted with a DOOR SLAM as McCulloch storms onto the bridge.
MCCULLOCH: She's locked safe in her room, no thanks to either of you. Has he brought it back on course yet? Sean doesn't look at him, still trying to assimilate the wall of components.
MCCULLOCH: He's the son of the Captain, for Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able to operate this thing! Sean closes his eyes, trying to keep from losing his mind and temper. A fierce WAVE slaps the windows in front of Sean's face, motivating him to get his shit together. He checks the Omega and LORAN.
MCCULLOCH: Sean doesn't answer, moving to the seat behind the helm. His father's seat. Sean takes the chair, adjusting the wheel, watching the compass. He studies a series of buttons on the console.
SEAN: It worked.we're back on course! Sean feels his confidence instantly rejuvenated. Miss Van Deuten immediately embraces him. But a fraction of time TIGHT ON FIRE ALARM BUTTON Jason's fist SMASHES the alarm button.
MCCULLOCH: What's that?
SEAN: The fire alarm.
MCCULLOCH: Can you shut that damn thing off?? Sean moves to a bank of switches, his eyes darting around for the appropriate switch. Miss Van Deusen sees McCulloch remove the FLARE GUN from the cabinet.
MCCULIACH: There's only one person who needs to see it. And I'm going to find him.
MCCULLOCH: I doubt very much that one even What are you talking about?
MCCULLOCH: Use some common sense! Setting off a fire alarm causes panic.the same kind of panic caused by suggesting Jason Voorhees is on board. Enough is enough. He marches out the door. Sean finds the alarm kill switch, flipping it. The excruciating siren vanishes. He grabs a pair of rain jackets, tossing one to Miss Van We have to get everybody together just in case the fire's for real. Sean heads for the door, shoving it forward.
SEAN: We have to get everybody together just in case the fire's for real. Sean heads for the door, shoving it forward.
JULIUS: shoves the gun stock into his shoulder and takes instantaneous aim.but he doesn't shoot. He slowly lowers the rifle.
ANOTHER ANGLE: as MILES lowers the axe. They've just scared the shit out of each other.
MILES: I'll take the upper deck. Julius nods. They separate. Neither boy notices the smoke which is starting to emerge from a deck vent.
ANOTHER ANGLE: Only darkness and rain for a beat, then Miles materializes, curving around the gargantuan smokestack. He passes us and we SWING AROUND, now looking at the back of his head. He takes three more steps and JASON STEPS INTO THE FOREGROUND. Miles senses his presence and JERKS
JULIUS: His answer is a LOUD CRACK OF LIGHTNING. At the same RUNNING WITH MILES He's scrambling as fast as he can across the slippery deck as the monster relentlessly pursues him.
MILES: slips on a rung, regains control, and continues upward. He makes it three more steps, almost at the uppermost point when JASON GRABS THE BACK OF HIS COAT, TEARING HIM
STUNT FREEFALL: Miles cries out as he FREEFALLS BACKWARDS, somersaulting and twisting like he's doing one of his better dives.
JULIUS: doesn't get the chance to grasp the reality of it because
YOUNG JASON: Hhhhelp me..I'm drowning.
RENNIE: stands frozen, feeling herself drawn to him like a magnet. She crawls to the edge of her rug, which is now a deep lake, and extends her arms to him.
YOUNG JASON: grabs her hand, pulling hard, then grinning wide.
RENNIE: feels the skin on her face crawling off her skull, her eyes expanding because she's now looking at:
HERSELF!: Rennie is holding onto herself, about four years younger in a bathing suit, drowning in the lake. YOUNG RENNIE.
YOUNG RENNIE: screams with guttural fear, letting go of herself, watching her younger self drown in the hole in her room.
RENNIE: screams with guttural fear, letting go of herself, watching her younger self drown in the hole in her room.
YOUNG RENNIE: disappears under the surface of the water.which seconds later CHANGES BACK INTO HER OVAL RUG.
NEW ANGLE: as Rennie moves away, tears rolling down her face, utterly confused. She backs against the wall next to her porthole window and THE REAL JASON'S FIST SMASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW, GRABBING HER THROAT. Rennie struggles, gasping for air as he attempts to strangle her.
RENNIE: sinks to the floor, scrambling on all fours to get as far away from the porthole as possible. She makes it across the room to her stateroom door just as:
THE DOOR: is SLAMMED OPEN FROM THE OTHER SIDE. She shrieks in terror but it's SEAN who is standing there.
SEAN: ( pointing ) The window. Sean rushes to the shattered porthole, looking out, seeing nothing. He steps back to her.
RENNIE: ( pointing ) The window. Sean rushes to the shattered porthole, looking out, seeing nothing. He steps back to her.
RENNIE: I don't understand what is happening to me. She breaks down; he holds her.
SEAN: It's gonna be okay.
RENNIE: What is it?? One second later, the lights begin to flicker.
SEAN: The power room.
MCCULLOCH: almost flinches when the lights die and he's plunged into blackness. He moves forward, every step tentative. He passes the convection ovens and we REMAIN on them, spotting the frightened face of the DECK HAND in the shadows. The deranged old man is very sober now, clutching a LARGE KITCHEN KNIFE for defense.
SEAN: Rule one, don't panic. Rule two, assess the damage and act Is the ship going to sink?? He returns to Rennie, the panic settling back in.
RENNIE: Is the ship going to sink?? He returns to Rennie, the panic settling back in.
SEAN: I don't know. Her ultimate fear is staring her straight in the face. Suddenly the dim blue lights flicker on.
SEAN: The emergency lights just kicked in. Sean makes Rennie look into his eyes. His words are meant to convince himself as much as Rennie.
SEAN: We'll be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case.
RENNIE: ( terrified ) I'm not going near any lifeboat!
SEAN: But Rennie.
RENNIE: I'm not!!
MCCULLOCH: MCCULLOCH'S POINT OF VIEW The room is empty, shards of the porthole glass scattered across her rug. He steps over to it, bringing his head up to the gaping hole, peering outside. We wait for his attack.but it doesn't come. McCulloch's eyes take us to something across the room. The bathroom door is afar.
MCCULLOCH: cautiously steps up to the door, silently grabbing the knob and SWINGING IT OPEN. It's empty. He hears something, spinning around. Again, nothing is there. McCulloch quickly moves to the telephone and dials. A few seconds pass.
MCCULLOCH: Come on, answer!!
SEAN: Water has gotten to the engines. We have to get everybody off this INSERT - ABANDON SHIP BUTTON as Jason presses it with firm deliberation, and:
REVERSE ANGLE: It's MCCULLOCH who's approached them. He grabs Miss Van Deusen, shaking her violently.
MCCULLOCH: What did you do with Rennie??
MCCULLOCH: She never should've set foot on this ship. This is your fault!
SEAN: This is Jason's fault!
MCCULLOCH: ( shouting ) Not another word, do you hear me??
MCCULLOCH: Why aren't you with the others, Finally the message comes forth:
MCCULLOCH: Jason Voorhees is dead!! A PRIMAL SCREAM OF AGONY immediately cries out behind them, the words unintelligible. They turn around to witness THE DECK HANG STAGGERING TOWARDS THEM, GRIPPING
MCCULLOCH: raises the flare gun with zero hesitation and FIRES IT.
MCCULLOCH: Dear Christ.
SEAN: We have to get off this ship!! They back away from the horrid sight and begin to run, the Abandon Ship alarm still attacking their ears.
SEAN: Everybody in I'll get the hoists McCulloch has no time for politeness, moving to the lifeboat ahead of the women. Rennie stops cold, gazing classy-eyed at the small boat.
MCCULLOCH: Get in the boat, Rennie!
RENNIE: I.I can't.
MCCULLOCH: ( shaking her ) You can and you will!! He tries to slap her out of it, dragging her over to the boat, ignoring her terror-stricken frenzy.
SEAN: Stop it!!
RENNIE: She climbs in, moving to her equally, relieved dog, McCulloch and Miss Van Deusen right behind her.
JASON: rapidly moving down the staircase towards them. Sean's view is CUT OFF as the lifeboat sinks below deck level.
SEAN: Come on.faster..
JASON: standing by the hoist, hovering over the edge. Very SEAN ( TANK ) grabs an oar, turning back to McCulloch.
SEAN: Start rowing!! McCulloch takes the oar as Miss Van Deusen holds onto Rennie tightly, the girl's eyes squeezed shut. Sean looks up at the ship again, and:
SEAN: He's gone.
SEAN: It's Julius! Miss Van Deusen moves to help him and we:
MCCULLOCH: ( miserable ) If we don't find the shore soon we're all going to die. Sean tries to ignore him, keeping his mind on rowing.
JULIUS: Hey man, if I can make it, so can. Sean slowly nods, turning on the calculator.
JULIUS: Hey man, wake up! Check it out!! The other stir as well, opening their eyes, not sure if it's some kind of vision or if they are genuinely here.
JULIUS: God damn, we're in New York! You did it, my man!! Julius howls with delight, Miss Van Deusen hugging Rennie as Julius gives Sean the high-five. Toby barks.
CLOSER ANGLE: as they climb onto the barge. Rennie breathes with relief as she steps off the boat. She takes a final glance back at it and sees:
YOUNG RENNIE: flailing her arms in the water right next to the lifeboat, drowning.
YOUNG RENNIE: Suddenly a DECOMPOSED HAND REACHES UP FROM BELOW,
RENNIE: They all follow her eyeline.but the water is calm, nothing there.
MCCULLOCH: Come on everybody up the ladder. He's the first one up. Sean looks at Rennie, concerned, then hoists Toby up in his arms. They all begin climbing the ladder.
JASON: looks at it long and hard. He tears off his life preserver wits renewed ambition.
MCCULLOCH: A wonderful choice of places to dock a boat, Mr. Robertson. Sean looks away, trying to keep from losing his temper.
RENNIE: She pushes his arm to the side just as the bullet
JULIUS: We can't let those gang-bangers get away, man. Julius starts to move after them. McCulloch grabs him.
MCCULLOCH: You heard him! We have to call the Julius jerks away from McCulloch's grasp. But he knows McCulloch is right.
MCCULLOCH: Everyone split up we'll cover more ground that way.
MCCULLOCH: My niece's life hangs in the balance right now!! Every second counts. No more rebuttal. They hurry off.
ANOTHER ANGLE: looking back at the steam vent. JASON APPEARS IN THE
RENNIE: Please don't.
WIDER ANGLE: Jason is standing right behind him, shoving something into his back, out of frame. He thrusts it again, bringing with it one more horrific grunt from the kid. Jason goes for number three and:
RENNIE: opens her eyes, looking into the dead boy's face as blood drips from his mouth. He collapses in front of her, giving way to a view of JASON TOWERING OVER HER. At the same time:
BANG!: .but Jason keeps on coming. Five shots later and Jason's still standing, easily picking up the slime ball and SHOVING HIM HEAD FIRST INTO THE MOSSY BRICK WALL. The kid falls in a bloody heap.
RENNIE: shoves Gang Banger #1 off of her as Jason returns his attention to her. She grabs a loose brick and FLINGS IT AT HIM, CRACKING HIS HOCKEY MASK, momentarily disorienting him. Rennie sprints away.
JULIUS: slams open the booth door, grabbing the receiver, punching the "operator" digit. SLOWLY PUSH IN on him as he waits for an answer. Several more rings.
JULIUS: Finally a click and muffled words from the operator.
JULIUS: Get me the police this is an SMASH! as JASON'S FIST CRASHES THROUGH THE BOOTH WINDOW, GRABBING JULIUS BY THE THROAT. Julius grips Jason's scaly arm with all his strength, staring at the cracked hockey mask framed in the shattered window. Julius summons all his strength, tearing free of Jason's grasp and running out the door. The phone is left dangling.
REVERSE ANGLE: as Julius soon learns the awful truth that the only way up is the only way down.with the exception of a head- splitting freefall. No way is he gonna jump. Julius turns back to Jason, raising his fists, psyching himself up for the fight of his life. He whispers to himself:
JULIUS: Use the combos and keep the feet THE FIGHT BEGINS, man against monster, each sizing the other up. Jason takes the first swing, Julius deftly dodging him and countering with left-right-left combination. They have absolutely no effect. Julius follows up with a round of kidney punches. Again, nothing. Julius finds himself being forced back against the rings, which in this case is the edge of the roof. He risks a glance backwards and JULIUS' POINT OF VIEW It's a long, rough way down. It's do or die time.
JULIUS: Take your best shot, motherfucker. Jason gladly obliges, winding up and recoiling with a punch none of us expected.
SEAN: Rennie.what'd they do to you??
RENNIE: ( serious pause ) Then Jason came. He's here, Sean. Oh Jesus. He never expected this.
SEAN: We have to find the others. Together they run off.
TRACKING SHOT: She moves forward, the only sound being her shoes against wet asphalt. Four more steps, then a DARK, OUT OF FOCUS
VOICE: RACK FOCUS to find a uniformed IRISH COP standing there, service revolver raised. McCulloch steps out from the alcove as well, recognizing Miss Van Deusen.
MCCULLOCH: It's okay she's with me. She turns around, lowering her hands, utterly relieved.
IRISH COP: My apologies, Miss. My unit's right over here. They head through an ABANDONED PARKING LOT towards a concrete wall with stairs; about six feet above the wall is an upper street, where his patrol car is parked. They get halfway through the lot when they hear:
REVERSE ANGLE: as Sean and Rennie run to join them from the alley. McCulloch rushes to his niece.
MCCULLOCH: Rennie, thank God. But Rennie goes to Miss Van Deusen instead. It's a bitter pill for McCulloch.
SEAN: Jason's here in New York.
MCCULLOCH: Don't be ridiculous!
IRISH COP: Is this the lass in question?
MCCULLOCH: ( stewing ) Who is.Jason?
IRISH COP: Who is.Jason?
MCCULLOCH: He's a walking corpse, a phantasm from The others stare at McCulloch angrily. Miss Van Deusen turns to the confused policeman.
IRISH COP: So try me.
IRISH COP: You're right I find it a tall tale But you seem like honest folks so I'm inclined to believe at least some of Thank you. The first thing we' have to do is find Julius.
IRISH COP: I'm sure he'll pop up soon enough. Why don't you climb in the back while I radio for backup.
SEAN: There aren't any handles!! Cocaine flowing through her veins, Rennie acts hyperkinetically, scratching her way over the seats just appears at the parking lot stairs, STALKING STRAIGHT
JASON: appears at the parking lot stairs, STALKING STRAIGHT
RENNIE: slams on the brakes, jerks it into reverse and FLOORS IT
RENNIE: stomps on the brake pedal and the tires SCREECH TO A HALT. They all take a moment to catch their breath, looking out the front window.
RENNIE: desperately throws it into forward again, gripping the wheel and RACING FORWARD.
MCCULLOCH: Rennie, for God's sake slow down!! She doesn't hear him, or anything for that matter. Her eyes remain straight ahead, never blinking.
ANOTHER ANGLE: as the front passenger door is shoved open by Sean, who drags out Rennie. McCulloch follows close behind, helping Sean carry her away from the wreckage, over by a row of old oil drums filled with slime and rainwater. Then it suddenly hits Sean.
SEAN: Miss Van Deusen. He takes two steps back to the car when:
RENNIE: opens her dazed eyes, seeing Miss Van Deusen's body charring inside the wreckage. It's incomprehensible. She numbly gets to her feet, stepping towards it. Something makes her hesitate: she peers down at the asphalt.
YOUNG RENNIE: What a beautiful day.
MCCULLOCH: Perfect for a swim, isn't it? She frowns at him, looking away.
MCCULLOCH: You've been coming out here every summer for the last three years, young lady, and you still haven't learned I'll take some lessons this time. I She bends over, splashing the water.
YOUNG RENNIE: I'll take some lessons this time. I She bends over, splashing the water.
MCCULLOCH: That's what you said last year. I think the time for your first swimming lesson has just come. The splashing stops.
MCCULLOCH: You don't want to end up drowning like that Voorhees boy, do you? She's instantly tense.
MCCULLOCH: He never learned how either and he's still at the bottom of this lake.
YOUNG RENNIE: He is not.
MCCULLOCH: Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull down anybody who falls in and can't You're telling a lie.
YOUNG RENNIE: You're telling a lie.
MCCULLOCH: Am I? Let's find out. .And quicker than she's able to react to it, MCCULLOCH
SPLASH!: as Rennie's body violently disrupts the calm surface. She immediately begins to flounder. McCulloch calmly leans over the edge.
MCCULLOCH: Better swim before Jason drags you down, Rennie. Come on, you can do .but Rennie thrashes in the water, struggling to keep from sinking under the surface.
YOUNG RENNIE: I.I can't.
MCCULLOCH: You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!
RENNIE: is too panicked to obey.
YOUNG RENNIE: She coughs on some water then disappears.
RENNIE: You pushed me.
MCCULLOCH: ( defensively ) I was only trying to teach you. But I pulled you out, Rennie. I saved your Rennie just stares, incredulous.
SEAN: You son of a bitch. She lets it build until she's ready to explode.then:
RENNIE: He was down there!!! And Rennie runs off. McCulloch starts to follow but Sean grabs him, shoving him down.
SEAN: You keep away from her! Sean chases after Rennie. Camera methodically PANS BACK TO MCCULLOCH, crumpled on the ground. A very bitter man. He wipes his hands, getting ready to stand when THE SHADOW FALLS OVER HIM. His skin fades to porcelain white.
MCCULLOCH: You.are.NOT POSSIBLE. But possible, and actual, he is. A PAIR OF ROTTED ARMS
RENNIE: I was at school when they told me. 'Rennie, we have some very bad news. your parents have been killed in an auto accident.' Sean gently takes her hand, sharing her internal agony.
RENNIE: It seems like everybody I care about ends up. She can't finish. PUSH IN as Sean kisses her on the forehead, then makes her look into his eyes.
SEAN: Not this time. He caresses her face; it develops into a tender kiss. Finally she holds him back, letting it out. At the same STALKING POINT OF VIEW Somebody is creeping at a low angle towards them.
TOBY: cautiously approaching them. Rennie stands, absolutely She starts to move towards him and her dog SNARLS
RENNIE: She starts to move towards him and her dog SNARLS
RENNIE: What's wrong, boy? Another protective growl, then:
CRASH!: as Jason stampedes through a stack of crates and garbage cans behind them.
TICKET TAKER: The teenagers are soon forgotten as JASON SMASHES THROUGH
SEAN: Come on. .but Jason arrives before the train. Toby barks and snarls, trying to protect them. Jason is unfazed. He treads toward them and:
DOG TOBY: leaps onto Jason, sinking his teeth into the monster's throat. Jason wrestles the animal into submission just THE SUBWAY TRAIN streaks into the station. A fraction of time later:
JASON: heaves the dog in front of the train.
RENNIE: shrieks in horror as Toby disappears inside the pit just as the train roars by.
SEAN: makes Rennie look away, dragging her with him along the platform edge in retreat as Jason returns his attention to them. They reach the end of the platform, having no choice but to board the front car.
TRAIN ENGINEER: Hey pal, you can't do that. A second later he's gotten a good look at Jason. It's too late for a retraction as JASON SAVAGELY JAMS HIS HEAD
JASON: fires out from the tunnel, grabbing onto Sean's ankle. Rennie screams as Sean is dragged down.but he manages to latch onto a chain securing a garbage receptacle. Jason pulls harder, stretching Sean to his limit as Rennie watches helplessly.
RENNIE: runs straight towards the track pit like a football punter, RECOILING WITH HER RIGHT LEG, KICKING JASON
NO!!!: runs straight towards the track pit like a football punter, RECOILING WITH HER RIGHT LEG, KICKING JASON
RENNIE: runs straight towards the track pit like a football punter, RECOILING WITH HER RIGHT LEG, KICKING JASON
SEAN: It's over, Rennie. It's finally over. Camera RISES ABOVE THEM, RACKING BACK TO THE SUBWAY EXIT. Guess who has just made an encore.with more energy than ever!!!
SEAN: God.please no. But Jason keeps on coming.
RENNIE: Somebody help us!! He's going to kill But the heavy Times Square foot traffic ignores her, bustling onward. Rennie and Sean have no choice but to flee again.
JASON: shoves his way through the preoccupied pedestrians; they've certainly seen weirder characters than him here. He moves past a group of STREET URCHINS listening to some rap from their ghetto blaster. His foot obliterates their stereo system with one stride. They instantly pull out switchblades and chains.
STREET URCHIN: You're dead meat, slime bag. Jason stops, turning around, towering over the kids. He has blood and gore caked everywhere, his skin charred from the electrocution. Jason starts to remove his mask, facing them squarely.
STREET URCHIN: Hey man, it's cool, it's cool. They turn tail and race like the wind. Jason steps forward so that we're looking at the back of his head, never seeing his naked face. He slips his hockey mask on again, turns into a CLOSE UP, then exits.
SEAN: ( out of breath ) You have to call the police.
RENNIE: Please, hurry. A telephone sits right next to her, but this is New York.
WAITRESS: There's a pay phone in back. They start to run.
WAITRESS: .but it's broken.
RENNIE: You don't understand there's a maniac trying to kill us!!!
WAITRESS: ( blase ) Welcome to New York. There's no time for further response as JASON CRASHES
ANOTHER ANGLE: as the BURLY CHEF comes out to confront him. Jason FLINGS
THE WAITRESS: picks up the telephone, really pissed off.
A BIKER: climbs off his counter stool, revealing a HUGE BOWIE KNIFE. Jason plows straight for him and the Biker STABS JASON IN THE HEART. Jason has little reaction, pulling it out, tossing it aside. The Biker's face goes wan, backing THE WAITRESS stops in mid-dial. Fear is starting to register now.
THE WAITRESS: stops in mid-dial. Fear is starting to register now.
JASON: lifts the very large man and EFFORTLESSLY HEAVES HIM INTO
THE WAITRESS: feels the phone receiver slipping from her grasp, her mouth trembling. She backs away from the beast as far as she can. Jason has no time to waste on her, trampling out the back after Rennie and Sean as the other patrons shrink from him.
RENNIE: She's spotted a MANHOLE COVER, slightly ajar. They haven't the luxury of thinking about it, Sean sliding the cover back as Jason comes forth.
TRACKING SHOT: as they come forward at a brisk but cautious pace, strangers in a very strange land.
REVERSE ANGLE: .but it's a middle-aged SANITATION ENGINEER who lowers the wrench, as frightened as they are.
SANITATION ENGINEER: What the hell are you kids doing down Can you help us get out??
SEAN: Can you help us get out??
SANITATION ENGINEER: I sure can and we don't have a minute to waste. He begins quickly packing up his tools.
SEAN: What do you mean?
SANITATION ENGINEER: Toxic waste, son. This sewer floods out with the stuff on the 13th of every month, right at midnight. And that's less than ten minutes from Rennie looks down the dark tunnels in all directions, swallowing hard.
SANITATION ENGINEER: Follow me. He clicks on his high powered flashlight and quickly leads them down:
THE FLASHLIGHT: rolls through the muck, its beam splashing erratically across the polluted walls.
RENNIE: tries to help up Sean but he's been knocked into the opposite wall, barely conscious.
SEAN: Run, Rennie. She's struck with indecisive shock, looking into Tunnel #3, seeing:
RENNIE: backs away but does not run. The time has come to face her fears.
RENNIE: You never got me in the lake, Jason. And you're not going to get me now Her voice is defiant. She carefully backstops, the irritating light never leaving us.
JASON: has been sufficiently taunted. He moves after her.
RENNIE: drops the can, fumbling for the flashlight again.
ANOTHER ANGLE: as Rennie skirts past the blinded creature: WHIP PAN WITH HER as she turns down Tunnel #2, heading back toward Sean. CONTINUE TO QUICKLY PAN AROUND until we've come around 360 degrees and are back on JASON, in no way ready to give up. He staggers after Rennie.
RENNIE: Get up, Sean!!! His eyes blink, only half coherent. Then an inconceivable terror registers in her ears.A LOW, DEEP RUMBLING SOUND, COMING FROM UP AHEAD. Her head jerks in the direction of her planned retreat:
RENNIE: rotates her head and sees:
JASON: vision or no vision, he is lurching towards her relentlessly. She is literally sandwiched between hell and high water.
RENNIE: drags Sean to his feet with the strength of a possessed woman, pulling him over to a SERVICE LADDER attached to the intersecting alcove wall.
RENNIE: ( screaming ) She shoves him up it from below, Sean summoning everything he's got to obey her. Rennie shoots a stare back down the tunnel.
JASON: within ten feet of them, shifting directly for the ladder like he's working on some kind of radar.
RENNIE: slips on the rusty ladder, regaining her footing. and rushing higher. She takes her final glance into the tunnel, the ultimate horror registering in her corneas as she sees:
JASON: has just started to climb the ladder when the wind and smell of the rushing toxic waste bombards him. His decomposed head swivels to face:
JASON: Mmmmmmmmmommy.DON'T LET ME DROWN,
YOUNG JASON: Hhhhelp me.. A split second later:
SEAN: I hear there's a statue here that's 22 stories tall. Rennie would smile if she could. She kisses his cheek. They amble on.
TOBY!: Limping on all fours, filthy with grease-matted fur. The whimpering dog crawls up to her, Rennie bending down, hugging her animal like she'll never let go.
RENNIE: Oh Toby.
