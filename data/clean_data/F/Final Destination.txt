"FINAL DESTINATION": Originally Called "FLIGHT 180" By James Wong and Glen Morgan January 15, 1999 Awaiting..each of us; a cold.dark.lonely place. Deny its finality. Deride its totality. Dread the inescapable inevitability..it will arrive. The BLACK SILENT SCREEN senses this moment before a distant blues harp introduces a contemporary band's cover of Blood, Sweat, and Tears' campy, yet haunting, gospel, "And When I Die." As the Introduction closes, RESONATES. A FLASH OF LIGHTING!
THE BED: A Paris guidebook is tossed atop the plane ticket. CAMERA PUSHES IN ON THE BOOK as the fan's breezes flip through the pages.
BARBARA: CAMERA ADJUSTS, to fully reveal Alex Browning as he turns toward the bedroom door. Alex is an average kid; handsome. A high school "everyman." One the wall amongst Yankee and Knicks posters, hangs a pennant; "Mt. Abraham High School, New York. The Fighting Colonials!" Alex's mother, BARBARA, 45, walks in, excited and a bit anxious. Barbara moves towards the suitcase to help him pack. Alex's father, KEN BROWNING, 48 appears, leaning against the door threshold, smiling enviously at his son.
KEN: My suitcase workin' out for ya?
ALEX: Whoa! Whoa! Mom, you gotta leave that on. It's like. the tag made the last flight without crashin' or anything, right? So, it should stay on, or with, the bag for good luck.
BARBARA: Where would you get a nutball idea like that?
RETURN: As Barbara picks up the suitcase to place it on the floor. a dozen old baggage I.D. tickets spill from the outer compartment. She looks at Ken, as if "you?" The guilty party shrugs.
KEN: I'm still here. Seventeen and on the loose. Ten Got your whole life ahead of you.
ALEX: CAMERA CREEPS IN as, oddly, the words strike him portentously.
THE WINDOWS: which. are closed.
ALEX: puzzled, checks.
ALEX: perplexed, rolls over toward his digital clock. It's 1:00 a.m., however. the middle digit bar in the first zero faintly flickers so this time appears to read. 1:80.
MR. WAGGNER: Alright, you guys got everything?
TOD: Yeah, we're all set Dad.
MR. MURNAU: Les estudients, allons en France!
MR. WAGGNER: Does that mean "go?"
MR. WAGGNER: I'll miss you guys.
MR. WAGGNER: Take care of those two, Alex.
ALEX: I will. Don't worry.
TOD: I didn't think anything could worse than my yearbook picture.
GEORGE: Now you know how I feel havin' to look at you all the time.
MR. MURNAU: Entendez classe, qu'est ce que c'est l'announce?
CARTER HORTON: is the class dickhead who mix and matches his role models in the most superficial manner. His hand is tucked into his girlfriend, TERRY CHANEY'S, waistband.
CARTER: ( re: MURNAU ) What the fuck's he want?
CLEAR: The airport doesn't endorse Tres bien, Clear! Tout droit!
MR. MURNAU: Tres bien, Clear! Tout droit!
ALEX: Fuh-ck, do we have to put up with
HARE KRISHANA: Death is not the end.
MS. LEWTON: It will be for you if you harass my students.
HARE KRISHANA: ( pissy ) Hare Rama.
MS. LEWTON: ( mouths ) Fuck off.
TICKET CLERK: I have a few questions to ask you
ALEX: CAMARA CREEPS IN on his dawning paranoia.
TICKET DESK: Alex is still considering the "messages."
TICKET CLERK: Have you recieved any packages from persons unknown to you?
RETURN: Alex eyes the new tag hoping it's "good luck." As the clerk returns his ticket and passport. CLACK, CLACK, CLACK.
TICKET CLERK: Same as your birthday.
BILLY: I can't believe they let that
GEORGE: His parents bought a ton of those
TOD: Dude, I so worked the ticket clerk so you're sittin' next to Christa
TOD: Dude, if we don't get someone going on this flight, we should just call Dr. Kervorkian and put ourselves out of our fuckn' misery.
CLEAR: The student continues down toward the observation deck. Clear looks at the opened guidebook.
CLEAR: CAMERA INCHES IN as she shakes off a shiver down her spine. She looks up from the book toward the student who handed it to her, the identity of which is fully REVEALED to be Alex Browning. He stands at the gate window, looking out at the plane.
ALEX: CAMERA inches in on him.
ALEX: Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay.
TOD: Dude, get wisdom. We're about to a wicked cable and then right after
ALEX: John Denver.
ALEX: He died in a plane crash.
P.A. SYSTEM: Ladies and Gentlemen, thank-you for your patience, at this time we would like to begin pre-boarding of Euro-Air Flight 180 to Paris through gate 39.
ALEX: looks down the paasenger ramp.
WIDER: There is something more emotionally tense about the moment of boarding than take-off. CAMERA PICKS UP Ms. Lewton searching.
MS. LEWTON: Anyone seen Billy Hitchcock? How'd we lose him?
MR. MURNAU: Vingt huit, vingt neuf.
PASSENGER RAMP: Alex, Tod, and George catch up to Christa and Blake, excited. As always, everyone becomes bottlenecked just at the point of entering the plane. Alex looks out the ramp's side porthole window toward the back of the plane.
ALEX: looks away. Just ahead, in the plane, FLIGHT ATTENDANTS greet the passengers. He is next to enter the plane.
ALEX: CAMERA PUSHES INTO HIM as he takes his first step into the plane.
GEORGE: Good sign. Younger the better. It would be a fucked-up God to take down this plane.
GEORGE: A REALLY fucked-up God.
ALEX: climbs into the row, carrying his backpack. He takes his window seat and reaches up to the air flow valve.
CHRISTA: Could you trade seats with Blake so she and I can sit together? I asked Tod, but he says he's got some medical thing?
ALEX: sneaks a quick check with Tod.
TOD: ( mouths ) C'mon, man, like you really thought
ALEX: C'mon, man, like you really thought
TOD: Because of you, I gotta sit here and
ALEX: The jet lurches. He looks.
ALEX: As he looks back, searching for the nearst flight attendant.
ALEX: lifts a bit out of his seat, searching for any flight attendant O.S., A PING.
ALEX: O.S., the ENGINE VOLUME INCREASES in PITCH and INTENSITY as the jet begins to taxi. Alex sits back as the tray over his lap. He looks out the window.
ALEX: The ENGINES WHIR as the jet gathers SPEED. He checks the window.
ALEX: O.S., his classmates CHEER and "raise the roof." The trip has begun. CAMERA PULLS AWAY FROM ALEX, as if reflecting his easing of annoyance with the tray situation. He finally appears to notice the raucous reaction and settles back in his seat, slightly pushed by mild-g force. The upwarding angle increasing. The cabin buffets, as if passing mild turbulance. Then. The cabin sharply JOLTS! Everyone tenses, GASPS. CAMERA SWEEPS BACK TO ALEX. And just as he clenches his backpack. the cabin BANGS, ROCKS. THE ENGINES SPOOL TO A STALL. METAL TWISTS under extreme PRESSURE. The cabin dips, angles, sharply to the right.
OXYGEN MASKS: deploy from the overhead compartments. A prerecorded message, like that recorded by the black box of the crash of JAL# 123 August 12, 1985, BLARES over the P.A., with erie calm.
ALEX: his hand trembles as he reaches for the oxygen mask and places it over his face. The ENGINES resuscitate. SCREAMING. WHINING. Alex checks out his window.
ALEX: breaths deep into his oxygen cup. The JET ENGINES GRIND AND WHIR, as if the craft were in the midst of a last-ditch effort to regain stability; the sounds DEAFENING over the PASSENGERS' cruelly hopeless SCREAMS. A DEVASTATING EXPLOSION ERUPTS across the cabin, blasting a five foot hole in the fuseluge. Human limbs and blood spray, craft and passengers torn to shreds. Dead students sit lifeless in their seats. Every unrestrained object on board flies to the hole and through the fire; paper, books, luggage, pillows. A PARENT and a STUDENT clutch their seat in terror, SCREAMING before they are pulled into the sky. Wind. Screams. Dying engines, a deafening blare.
ALEX: Drenched with sweat, trembling in his seat, his eyes dart toward Christa and Blake. They look great and they're workin' the sex appeal.
CHRISTA: Could you trade seats with Blake so
TOD: Dude, what up?
ALEX: grabs the tray table latch before the vacent seat. IT BREAKS OFF, JUST AS BEFORE. CAMERA PUSHES INTO ALEX, terrified. He begins to hyperventilate.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Is there a a problem, sir?
CARTER: What's your fuckin' problem?
MR. MURNAU: Alex? Qu'est-ce se?
ALEX: Qu'est-ce se?! THE PLANE'S GONNA
EXPLODE!: Obviously, no one ever wants to ever hear that. The students tense.
ALEX: frenzied, begins moving toward the aisle.
ALEX: We have to get out!
CLEAR RIVERS: CAMERA PUSHES INTO HER, hearing Alex's declaration.
RETURN: Alex is desperately climbing over Tod, who is trying to calmly restrain his friend. Across the aisle, Carter Horton stands ready to quiet Alex, with force.
CARTER: Sit! DOWN! Browning!
ALEX: I'm not joking! I'm not joking!
ALEX: Listen to me! This plane will explode on take-off!
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Sir, we will remove you from the aircraft if this continues.
CARTER: I'll remove him.
ALEX: Fuck you! I'll remove myself!
TERRY: He didn't do nothin'!
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: ( he's had it ) Anybody in the aisle is off the No, wait, I was late. that's my
BILLY: No, wait, I was late. that's my
TOD: starts off down the aisles. CAMERA COUNTERS. ADJUSTING TO CLEAR RIVERS. Amongst the chaos, she considers for a beat, then grabs her backpack, stands and moves into the aisle to exit the plane.
BILLY: I didn't do anything! I have my
MS. LEWTON: PLEASE. I've got forty students
ALEX: CAMERA MATCHES THE MOVE TO HIM AS TOD and Mr. Murnau attempt to calm him down.
TOD: It's alright. It's alright. You're
MS. LEWTON: Airline's not taking this very well. They'll let one of us back on and the rest can grab a six-ten flight. Gets in two hours later at DeGaulle. It's alright. It's not that big of a I'll stay.
MR. MURNAU: I'll stay.
MS. LEWTON: No, you know the whole French thing.
BILLY: I was in the bathroom. The lock was
TOD: I called your mom and dad and
MS. LEWTON: Alex, talk to me. What happened?
ALEX: I. I saw it. like, I don't know. the plane took off. I saw it leave the runway. I looked down and saw the ground.
TOD: Been on many planes that blew up,
MS. LEWTON: You must have fallen asleep.
CARTER: We get thrown off the plane and blow It's going to explode! It's going to Fuck off, Horton.
TOD: Fuck off, Horton.
MS. LEWTON: A raw nerve, Alex stands.
ALEX: Only trip you're gonna take is to
OBSERVATION DECK: CAMERA PUSHES INTO Billy Hitchcock, depressed as he watches the plane take off.
BILLY: There they go and here we stay.
AIRPORT TERMINAL: One guard restrains Alex; another Carter. In the b.g. out of the observation deck window. Flight 180 lifts off the runway.
CARTER: You're payin' for my trip, Browning!
ALEX: I wish you were on the plane!
CLEAR RIVERS: CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HER, rattled, afraid, but aware of Alex as she is first to turn her eyes toward him.
GATE 39: Billy Hitchcock walks backward from the window, shocked by shocked step. Ms. Lewton drops to her chair as her legs give out. O.S., ALARMS BEGIN. The two security guards tear off toward more urgent duties. O.S., OUTSIDE, SIRENS WAIL as emergency vehicles race to the tragedy. CAMERA BEGINS TO MOVE toward ALEX. as Tod's head turns toward him, then Terry's. then Carter's. In the chair, beginning to cry, Ms. Lewton eyes Alex, as if afraid of him. CAMERA CONTINUES. SIRENS PIERCING. The emergency vehicles' strobing red lights reflect in Alex's eyes, now in TIGHT as he looks out, frozen with shock. upon the doomed FLIGHT 180.
SILENCE: A pair of Airline REPRESENTATIVES sit with the seven survivors, each numb with shock. Everyone is too raw with residual fear to show any emotion. They sit on folding metal chairs in an empty room, too bright from the fluorescent lights. Beneath their obvious trauma resulting from the catastrophe. each feels uneasy by Alex's presance. The others sit away from Alex and Tod. Alex appears wrought with guilt. He checks the others out of the corner of his eye.
ALEX: frightened as anyone over what has happened, tenses, defensive and scared. With softspoken strength.
ALEX: You're lookin' at me as if I caused
MS. LEWTON: Is everyone dead? Are there any
WIDER: Alex is taken aback by the question, yet even his best friend looks at him for an answer.
ALEX: How would I know? You think I'm some sort of.
CLEAR: He's not a witch.
WIDER: Causing a startle, the DOOR OPENS. Everyone's head whips reflexively toward the entrance. The strange event of the flickering lights is quickly forgotten. A half dozen MEN and WOMEN enter the room, displaying official badges and passes. All but two are dressed in casual clothing, having been called in from home; the pair being F.B.I. Special Agents WEINE and SCHRECK. HOWARD SEIGEL and DON HAWKS are representatives of the National Transportation Safety Board. EILEEN WHALE and JACK ARNOLD are members of the Euro-Air "Trauma Team." The officials are sympathetic and calm, exuding the confidence and security trauma victims look for at this time.
SEIGEL: Hello. I'm Howard Seigel, National Transportation Safety Board vice chairmen. We've notified your families and they are on their way. Does anyone feel they need medical attention or spiritual counseling at this time?
MS. LEWTON: Have they found any survivors? What's going on?
SEIGEL: The cause of the explosion is search and rescue are en route.
WEINE: We understand how you must be feeling at this hour. and although we know it may be difficult, we must ask you some questions. regarding today's events, while it's still fresh in your minds.
WEINE: It may be valuable to our rescue attempts, or any potential. criminal investigation.
ALEX: reacts, puzzled, as he realizes the Agents are focused on him.
SCHRECK: You said. "Listen to me! This plane will explode on take-off." How did you know that?
ALEX: CAMERA PUSHES IN as he looks up, nervous. not about suspicion toward him, but trying to explain what even he doesn't understand.
ALEX: I got this. feeling. a weird feeling. I can't explain it.
WEINE: Did you take any seditives before boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping No. I saw it. I saw it!
ALEX: No. I saw it. I saw it!
ALEX: Not like a dream. more than that.
SCHRECK: Did this "weird feeling" have anything to do with you saying you wished Carter Horton was on the plane. just before it exploded?
ALEX: Why'd you say it?
SCHRECK: Why'd you say it?
ALEX: Because. I. never thought it
WEINE: If that's the case, Alex. why did
TOD: My brother. told me to keep an eye He told me to get off the plane.
MS. LEWTON: Larry Murnau told me to get back I sent him back on the plane.
WEINE: No one forced you to get off the plane. You told us you aren't friends with any that did. so, why did you leave the airplane?
CLEAR RIVERS: CAMERA INCHES IN as she looks up. With total resolve.
CLEAR: Because I saw and I heard Alex. And. I believed him.
ALEX: his eyes moves toward.
CLEAR RIVERS: alone, hurt that no one has come to take her home.
ALEX: his eyes find.
ALEX: CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HIM as he holds his mother tightly. OVERLAPPING. A CRACK OF THUNDER!
CLEAR: Here's good.
CLEAR: Thank you for the ride.
ALEX: stands in the threshold of the doorway. His mother places a comforting hand on his shoulder.
ALEX: and now, the tears arrive. He begins crying, SOBBING, as his mother and father hold him. O.S., OUTSIDE. lighting FLASHES. THUNDER RUMBLES.
LIVING ROOM: It is late and dark. Only the pale light of the TV spills across the living room. Ken and Barbara have fellen asleep, but their son remains awake. Alex's red eyes are locked on the screen, mortified. O.S., a VICIOUS CRACK of LIGHTNING and immediate THUNDER. as if calling Alex to the window. He remains fixed on the TV.
ALEX: He turns, stands. and moves to the picture window, pulling the curtains aside as CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HIM.
ALEX: horrified, lurches away from the window, considering what he has seen. Just felt on the ROAR OF THUNDER.
ALEX: guiltily averts his eyes. Ken notes this and wraps a comforting arm around his son.
ALEX: turns away, tense. He looks at the minister.
ALEX: self-consciously turns away, unable to face her, let alone the words being spoken.
WIDER: A student with a guitar and harmonica stands at the microphone. Without introduction, he begins Neil Young's "Long May You Run." Two other students remove a cloth, unveiling a memorial sculpture etched with the names of the departed. The gathered stand and begin paying their respects to the memorial.
MEMORIAL LINE: Carter and Terry appear IN FRAME. Terry holds a rose. As they move slowly up toward the memorial, Alex gets in line behind them. Carter knows Alex is there, but will not look at him.
CARTER: Hope you don't think, Browning, that
ALEX: I don't.
CARTER: ( re: victims ) All I owe is these people. ( turns to Alex ) To live my life to the fullest.
ALEX: Then maybe you should lay off the
CARTER: Don't ever fucking again tell me
CARTER: I'm never gonna die.
BILLY: I took my driver's test this week at
BILLY: Got a 70. Lowest score, but I That true?
ALEX: Not here, not now. Not EVER!
BILLY: If I ask out Cynthia Paster, will
RETURN: Alex stands near her, sympathetically, understanding her pain..
ALEX: Ms. Lewton.
MS. LEWTON: Don't talk to me. You scare the hell out of me.
TOD: ( a greeting )
ALEX: I don't want to sound gay, or nothin, but. I miss you.
RETURN: As Tod longs for his brother, then looks at his friend.
TOD: Me, too. But my dad doesn't understand. When
ALEX: That's a plan.
TOD: I gotta go. This thing Ms. Lewton showed me in her class, they're
CLEAR: Because of you. I'm still alive.
ALEX: looks up at the sky.
ALEX: CAMERA INCHES IN as, troubled, he looks back to Tod.
TOD: as he continues to read.
ALEX: sits at his desk, dark circles beneath his eyes. Swamping the desk are printouts of Internet Web pages and newspaper articles concerning the crash of Flight 180, forensic engineering textbooks, NTSB reports on past airline disasters and. REALITY BEYOND MATTER: Vaishnava Philosophy. Alex studies his mountain of research, increasingly obsessed. An O.S. paper FLUTTER draws his attention to the newspaper being blown by the fan. He reaches out and grabs it. Headlines and photos report on the memorial service. CAMERA PUSHES IN as he sighs, troubled.
ALEX: closes the paper, puzzled by his reaction. He shakes it off and throws the paper on the desk. Alex considers for a beat, then pulls open a lower drawer. Digging through the mess inside, he finds his stash. the April 1997 issue of Penthouse.
PENTHOUSE PICTORIAL: The model's pose and expression tempt Alex towards the momentary respite form his troubles. The caption beneath the centerfold pictorial reads, "Tymme Has Come Today!"
ALEX: considers the reports on the Flight 180 crash, then returns his attention to the magazine. He unzips his pants, then pauses. his eyes returning hesitantly to the newspaper photo of Clear.
TOD: turns on the faucet and grabs his toothbrush, squeezing paste onto the bristles.
TOD: notes the radio. CAMERA FLLOWS HIS HAND as he grabs the plug.
ELECTRICAL SOCKET: the radio plug is inserted.
TOD: turns on the radio.
ALEX: studies the photograph, then notices the rose she gave him. Succumbing to guilt, feeling like the freak all teenagers believe they are, Alex sets the paper back on the desk. He grabs the Penthouse and turns, opening the desk drawer in order to return the magazine, however. A LOUD BANG turns Alex's head to the window!
WIDER: Startled, Alex reflexively throws the Penthouse across the room, pages tearing as it hits the sill. The giant bird flies off.
ALEX: CAMERA INCHES IN ON HIM as the piece of paper ENTERS FRAME, floating and flitting until landing on his knee. He picks it up and turns it over.
TOD: falls foward.
TOD'S NECK: the thin clothesline coils around his neck. The plastic anchor wraps beneath the cord, essentially creating a noose.
TOD: falls against the back wall of the shower stall, pulled by the retracting wire. He kicks with his feet, desperately trying to gain a footing.
BATHTUB: Tod's feet slip in the slick shampoo and water.
TOD'S EYES: dart desperately toward the counter.
TOD: CHOCKING, GASPING, face turning purple, reaches for the counter.
TOD'S FACE: FALLS INTO FRAME, suspended by the cord, propped against the back wall of the shower stall, his bluish purple tongue grotesquely juts from his mouth.
TOD: The moment of realization.
HIS FEET: kick upon the slippery basin. After a beat. they stop.
TOD: As his body settles. dies. CAMERA PULLS AWAY fully revealing his lifeless form. Once behind the toilet tank, CAMERA CRANES DOWN to the floor. The water eerily retreats from the floor, slipping back toward the base of the toilet and like a murderer, slips out of the night.
ALEX: What happened? Is Tod alright?
ALEX: sees the officers. Assuming they are sympathetic to his concern, he starts toward them, until.
ALEX: is pale, nauseous. His eyes follow his friend's dead body as it is rolled toward the paramedics vehicle. Tod's father approaches Alex, the agents stand nearby.
ALEX: What. what happened?
MR. WAGGNER: Didn't you. "see" it?
ALEX: Mr. Waggner.
MR. WAGGNER: You caused Tod so much guilt over He took his own life.
ALEX: He wouldn't do it!
ALEX: He. he told me we would be friends again after you got better. After
MR. WAGGNER: All my wife and I will ever know is
FRONT YARD: everyone has moved away from Alex, leaving him very alone. Alex's eyes remained locked on the peramedics' vehicle. As the ambulance doors CLOSE on the body of his best friend.
ALEX: It's only the end of June.
CLEAR: ( shrugs ) Yeah, but everthing's always in transition. If you focus, even now, ( beat ) Almost like bein' able. to see the
CLEAR: Know what this is?
ALEX: Like, um. you're mad about
CLEAR: A piece of debris. from the plane.
ALEX: You went there? I've wanted to go It is. But that didn't stop me. Shouldn't stop you.
CLEAR: It is. But that didn't stop me. Shouldn't stop you.
ALEX: Why were you there last night?
CLEAR: Look, I've seen enough T.V. to know the F.B.I. doesn't investigate teen suicides. But they were there last people got off the plane is probably suspicious. And it doesn't help that
ALEX: Why were you there last night?
CLEAR: Know what this is?
CLEAR: It's you.
CLEAR: Not a likeness. It's how you make
ALEX: I'm. really sorry.
CLEAR: Like you, the sculpture doesn't even know what, or why, it is. Reluctant to take form. And, yet, creating an absolute but incomprehansible
CLEAR: And you can still feel it, can't
CLEAR: That's why I was there last night.
ALEX: I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, What if Tod. is just the first. of us?
CLEAR: What if Tod. is just the first. of us?
ALEX: What if Tod. is just the first. of us?
CLEAR: Is that something you're "feeling?"
ALEX: I don't know. I wish I could just see him. one more time, then, maybe.
CLEAR: Then, let's go see him!
CLEAR: ( whispering ) Gives me a rush.
ALEX: This place?!
CLEAR: Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.
CLEAR: Good call. Very "Quincy."
ALEX: That. him?
CLEAR: I think. But why'd they make him up like. Michael Jackson?
ALEX: That's him, but. he's not here.
MR. BLUDWORTH: CAMERA PUSHES, LOW ANGLE, INTO WILLAIM BLUDWORTH, an African-American man, early 50's, dressed in dark suit and tie.
MR. BLUDWORTH: You'll wake the dead.
ALEX: Alex completes his question by raising his hand, ala Tod's dead body. Bludworth nods, understanding.
MR. BLUDWORTH: Chemicals in the vascular flush create cadaveric spasm.
ALEX: I'm. a friend of his. His best friend. See, his father.
MR. BLUDWORTH: ( ominous ) I know who you are.
CLEAR: They said he hung himself, but
MR. BLUDWORTH: I crafted a reconstruction of the
ALEX: What are all those tiny marks?
WIDER: Why would he pull at the wire if he
ALEX: Why would he pull at the wire if he
CLEAR: Why would they say it was a suicide. if it weren't?
ALEX: His father's pretty fucked up with
MR. BLUDWORTH: In Death.
MR. BLUDWORTH: . there are no accidents. No coincidencess. No mishaps. And no. escapes.
ALEX: You saying Tod did kill himself?
MR. BLUDWORTH: Suicide. Murder. Plane crash. What
MR. BLUDWORTH: You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. Every single move we leading to the grave.
ALEX: The mortician considers as he drains some yellowish green fluid from the table. He shrugs then continues his work.
MR. BLUDWORTH: If Life is like a box of only upset the big hand holding the hospital you just see the big cage Game over.
ALEX: Maybe there's no way to win.
MR. BLUDWORTH: You already did that by walking off the plane. Now you gotta out when Play your hunch, Alex. If you think you can get away from it. But beware the risk of cheating the And you don't even want to fuck with
ALEX: I'm sorry we broke in.
MR. BLUDWORTH: No harm. No foul.
CLEAR: We didn't find what we were looking
ALEX: Yeah, we did.
MR. BLUDWORTH: CAMERA PUSHES INTO the mortician, pleased the message has been recieved.
MR. BLUDWORTH: I'll see you soon.
ALEX: He said Death has a design. Even before he said that I had been seeing patterns.
CLEAR: ( sarcastic ) As in flannels and plaids?
ALEX: How many died on Flight 180? From our group?
CLEAR: Remember the gate number?
ALEX: Remember the gate number?
CLEAR: This is a creepy fact. Even though past the construction, Alex checks over his shoulder to assure they are out of harm's way.
ALEX: This is a creepy fact. Even though past the construction, Alex checks over his shoulder to assure they are out of harm's way.
ALEX: Remember the departure time?
CLEAR: Like. 4:25.
INTERSECTION: Clear sighs, growing impatient with Alex.
CLEAR: Right. April 25th.
ALEX: Right. April 25th.
CLEAR: Wait. I thought you meant the time of your birth. Four/Twenty-five, as in, month and day. that's a reach.
INTERSECTION: Clear takes a step off the sidewalk and onto the street. Alex tugs her back, looking both ways while outraged by her challenge.
ALEX: My birthday is the same as of the
CLEAR: You're sounding like those people who, you know. "Oswald shot
ALEX: I'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I'm talking about indications. omens. that day, that we were meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of. would
CLEAR: That's total bullshit. You can find death omens anywhere you want to.
CLEAR: She's leaving the school. Moving
ALEX: Clear, how do we know that by just sitting here, breathing this air or sipping the coffee, having crossed the street. we haven't You don't unless. you're able to
CARTER'S CAR: CARTER scowls, his anger rising as he slows, staring at the perceived reasons for his problems.
CLEAR: I don't understand. did you see
ALEX: No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message. from someone, or something. hinting. at the design.
CLEAR: Alex, on the plane. you must have suggesting Tod's death. and maybe our own. will happen because of. an active Presence.
ALEX: The mortician said Death has a But what if it was our time, what if
CLEAR: After hearing you, just now. I do .that Tod killed himself.
ALEX: Then there's no one left who can help
CARTER'S CAR: His eyes having never left Alex, Carter suddenly cranks the wheel hard to the left to make a tight U-Turn.
BILLY HITCHCOCK: rides his bike. He reacts, startled by.
WIDER: Billy SWERVES to the left, directly in front of an oncoming car. The car SWERVES right, as does Billy, avoiding a certain fatal collision for the cyclist. The oncoming car HONKS! Carter's car pulls up to the curb. Oblivious to the accident he almost caused, Carter gets out, strutting toward the tables outside the coffee shop. Inside the car, Terry sighs.
TERRY: Baby, come on. not now.
TERRY: At that moment, Ms. Lewton exits with an ezpresso drink. Sensing trouble, she has no energy or desire to involve herself.
CARTER: Kind of have a reunion, here.
TERRY: Let it go!
CARTER: When are you moving?
MS. LEWTON: A couple of weeks.
CARTER: We're losing our favorite teacher.
ALEX: Look, there's something you should all know.
CLEAR: Carter eyes Alex, continuing the taunt. He raises the volume of his words to drown out Alex's words and incite conflict.
TERRY: Shut up! The both of you!
ALEX: has crashed, watching CNN. It's a tense recline. Red circles rim the lids of his eyes. He sips from the glass to settle his stomach. Ken appears from the kitchen, hand over the reciever.
KEN: It's that girl. Clear.
KEN: He's in the shower, Clear. Can I
ALEX: Dad. you and mom have helped me out, so much. But there's. some things I need to understand before I can talk. to anyone about it.
TELIVISION: A computer graphic illustrations the area of the lower fuselage.
TELEVISION: The graphic ZOOMS into the area in the rear right side, nearly above Tod's seat.
ALEX: CAMERA PUSHES IN as he listens.
TELEVISION: The high-tech computer image traces the path of the explosion through the plane. A red line representing the fuel line zigs through the body of the plane, making a sharp turn forward to the fuel pump, which explodes. Jagged lines show the direction of the explosion moving backwards toward the rear of the plane.
ALEX: is amped, intensely more frightened as he believes.
ALEX: The path of the explosion. That's Death's design.
MS. LEWTON: ( quickly ) Laura, I gotta call you back.
SCHRECK: What are you doing?
ALEX: is nervous but determined. He tells the truth.
ALEX: Checking the air in her tires to make sure they're safe.
SCHRECK: Get in the car.
ALEX: I believe that. Ms. Lewton's next.
WEINE: Yes. see, there's this.
ALEX: Yes. see, there's this.
WEINE: ( sarcastic ) Oh, you've noticed it, too?
MS. LEWTON: Oh. mom's favorite.
SCHRECK: Where'd you get this "pattern" from?
ALEX: I didn't ask for what happened to me on the plane. You can make fun of me. You can think I'm a nut. I'm used to
ALEX: I'm not suffering from Post Traumatic Stress. I haven't developed a narcissistic deity complex. I'm not This just is. There's a pattern in
ALEX: ( sighs ) And I'm not sure yet how. but I intend to break this one.
STOVE: Ms. Lewton turns on the gas, adjusts it, however. the flames blow out. She pauses, nerves on edge. Her eyes cautiously move about the room and find nothing. She grabs a pack of nearby matches and strikes one.
WEINE: Alex, you got our attention, at first, because you were under suspicion in the plane explosion.
ALEX: No. I can't. As long as I'm in
WEINE: Alright, go on. Get outta here.
SCHRECK: Kid gives me the creeps.
WEINE: We got nothing to hold him.
SCHRECK: I don't mean that. There's a couple of times, there. I almost believed him.
WEINE: Sometimes, you give me the creeps.
MS. LEWTON: picks up the cup, raising it toward her lips. She pauses, her expression turning tragic. On a reflex, she spins toward the sink and throws the hot contents into the drain. She sits the mug down.
MS. LEWTON: Trembling. She takes a deep breath, getting a hold of herself.
MS. LEWTON: You gotta stop this! Stop this! It's You're outta here. Pretty soon. you'll be gone.
COFFEE MUG: the ice cubes PLUNK. The cold alchohol pours into the hot mug. CAMERA PUSHES INTO THE MUG as. it slightly CRACKS, Vodka dripping out of the base. Lewton's hand picks up the mug, oblivious to the crack. She moves off toward the living room, leaving a trail of alcohol.
MS. LEWTON: sets the mug out of the way on the back edge of her desk.
JOHN DENVER: I've seen it rainin' fire from the
MS. LEWTON: her back is to the desk, while pouring styrofoam peanuts into the box. In the b.g., FLAMES, nearly supernaturally, leap up the walland toward the computer monitor.
MS. LEWTON: turns, holding her sheet of bubble wrap, shocked by the flames.
MS. LEWTON: a large jagged shard from the monitor flies into her throat. Blood squirts from her neck onto the bubble wrap. Her stunned expression is sickeningly numb from shock.
ALEX: senses the taunting message and breaks into a full sprint, passing through many of the burning leaves that break up into the bright orange cinders against the black sky.
FLOOR: Flames ride the small trickle of vodka back toward the kitchen.
THE STOVE: the flaming stream shoots up the stove, lighting the burners.
MS. LEWTON: behind her, the stove ERUPTS in FLAMES. They jump, leap like a tiger, landing on her shoulders and hair, which catch on fire.
COUNTER TOP: the draped edge of the towel pulls over the cutlery block. The knives spill out, entangled with the hand towel.
KITCHEN DOORWAY: Alex rushes across the threshold as Ms. Lewton pulls the knives over the counter.
MS. LEWTON: a half dozen knives, from small, but sharp, cutting blades to large butcher knives, cascade into her body.
THE STOVE: a gas line ERUPTS, creating a small EXPLOSION.
MS. LEWTON: the block lands directly on the butcher knife handle, driving the blade further into Ms. Lewton's body.
MS. LEWTON: as Death arrives, her eyes are macabrely focused above her.
ALEX: Even as blood squirts on him from her open wound, he appears to realize she is "seeing" the moment of death.
ALEX: Ms. Lewton!
BILLY: Hey, Alex.
THE HOUSE: from inside, an intense EXPLOSION propels glass from the windows. Flames engulf the entire house.
ALEX: even down the street, he is knocked to his feet by the blast. In the distance, SIRENS from approaching POLICE AND FIRE trucks are HEARD. He stands, looks to the now suspicious Billy. then opts to run off away from the scene. Escaping into the dark backyards of the neighborhood.
CLEAR: I don't know where he is. He's not talking to me.
WIDER: Agents Schreck and Weine stand before Clear in her garage.
WEINE: She studies the men before averting her eyes.
CLEAR: Because I didn't believe him.
SCHRECK: If he should contact you, it would be in the best interest of your own safety to contact us.
CLEAR: What are you doing?
CARTER: Terry's name should be on this wall.
CLEAR: They're watching me, see if I go to Are you?
BILLY: Are you?
CLEAR: They'll follow my car. That's why you're taking me.
CARTER: Why would I want to see him?
CLEAR: Because he knows which one of us is next.
BILLY: Um. okay. drive the speed limit,
CARTER: Billy! I'm gettin' a vision! You're the next one.
BILLY: ( nervous ) Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
CARTER: 'Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!
CLEAR: He could be anywhere from here to a
WIDER: Clear Rivers approaches, barefoot in the sand. He neddn't turn to know who is behind him.
CLEAR: When I was a kid, like, six or Every night. it seemed.
ALEX: Most kids do, I guess.
CLEAR: Most kids never have it happen.
CLEAR: When I was ten. my dad went into a 7-11 for cigerettes. I guess he heard somebody say "Don't turn around." So
CLEAR: And that is the only way we can beat
ALEX: This won't be safe.
CLEAR: Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away.
ALEX: No.. I mean, I don't have anything
CLEAR: ( sadly ) Nothing is. anymore.
ALEX: I can't go home. After Lewton's, they'll be after me.
CLEAR: We're takin' you to a cabin in the woods, it's only a couple miles from my house.
CARTER: Alright, Browning, you fuckin'
ALEX: Why do you think I was hiding?
CLEAR: Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you
ALEX: They blame me for everything. Her,
BILLY: Your shoe prints were in the blood.
ALEX: I already told you.
CARTER: ( interrupting ) I'm not talkin' about if you did it. Or if you knew she was dead. ( beat ) Did you know she was going to be
ALEX: ( quietly ) ( almost to himself ) When she died. at that moment, I could tell she saw something. horrible.
CARTER: Out of us. who's next to see it?
BILLY: Please tell me I'm gonna get to see the Jets win the Super Bowl.
CARTER: Me, right? That's why you're not
BILLY: Shoulda felt up Tammy in the pool, that time.
CARTER: ( to Billy ) Whatta you whinin' about? He said I'm He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
CLEAR: He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
CARTER: You have a responsibility to tell me.
ALEX: Is knowing going to make it easier?
CARTER: You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
ALEX: It doesn't matter who's next. we're all on the same list.
CARTER: Aww, fuck. really?
CARTER: Then why bother? What's the fuckin' point? Terry and me will be back together on the other side, so why wait any longer?
CLEAR: Knock it off!
CARTER: May as well go out under my own free will, right?
CLEAR: Not with us in the fuckin' car!
CARTER: What's your fuckin' worry? If it's wouldn't get shit! Only me, right?
BILLY: And I fuckin' HATED FRENCH CLASS!
CARTER: That's what I'm doin'!
CLEAR: I know what you're doing! It's
CARTER: I'm not afraid! I DECIDE WHEN IT'S
BILLY: Watch it! Watch it!
BILLY: I am. so close to puking, you don't wanna know.
CLEAR: We're afraid, too, Carter, but we're
CLEAR: So, stop what you're doing and STOP THIS CAR! Right fucking now!
CLEAR: Move it!
ALEX: Billy, get out!
RETURN: CLEAR ALEX Can't you open the door?! Easy, Billy, just open it.
CLEAR: Carter, get out!
CARTER: It ain't my time.
CARTER: looks up.
CARTER: as if the image has effected him, he looks to his lap belt and CLACKS the button. He tugs at the restraint, but it will not move. He's strapped in. He tries to open the door. it won't open. He pulls at the door handle. tugs at the seatbelt. panicked. Horrified, he whips towards the others.
CARTER: I can't get out!
BILLY: Man, he really is next.
CARTER'S CAR: Alex hustles around the drivers' side. CAMERA SWEEPS INTO THEM as Alex desperately tries freeing the seatbelt.
THE TRAIN: the WHISTLES SCREAMS!
TRAIN TRACKS: as the heavy train wheels THUNDER and CLACK, a broken two foot long shard of the car's debris BOUNCES upon the tracks, kicked about by the train wheels.
CLEAR: runs and falls into Alex's arms, holding him tight.
CLEAR: Scared now?
CARTER: It broke!
BILLY: No one's that strong.
CLEAR: ( to Carter ) Bullshit. He saved your life.again!
RETURN: The THUNDERING TRAIN intensifies the situation.
BILLY: THAT'S RIGHT! HE'S RIGHT! YOU ARE
YOU!: Billy begins backing away from the others.
CARTER: SHUT UP, BILLY! WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!
CLEAR: WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!
BILLY: I DON'T NEED IT EVER! GET AWAY FROM
CARTER: FUCK YOU, BILLY! I'M NOT DEAD!
BILLY: backing away.
BILLY: YOU WILL BE! YOU'RE DEAD! YOU'RE
DEAD!: TRAIN TRACKS the debris bounces directly on the track. With great power and force, a train wheel runs over the debris, cutting it in half. It catches in the wheel and is spun around until shot out with the force of a missile.
TRAIN TRACKS: the debris bounces directly on the track. With great power and force, a train wheel runs over the debris, cutting it in half. It catches in the wheel and is spun around until shot out with the force of a missile.
BILLY: BILLY ( CONT'D )
CARTER: Jesus fucking Christ!
ALEX: ( to Carter ) You should have been next. After Lewton, you should've been next.
CARTER: You're the fuckin' devil.
ALEX: ( to Clear ) But I saved him. I intervened. Just
CLEAR: Police are coming.
ALEX: That's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; Billy.
CARTER: "Intervention?" What are you, God Of course not! Gods aren't afraid to die! Gods don't die! We do!
ALEX: Of course not! Gods aren't afraid to die! Gods don't die! We do!
CLEAR: You're losin' it. The police will be here. We have to go to the cabin. You can hide there. Get your head
ALEX: After Billy. it's me. And then you.
CARTER: Then, get out of here.
ALEX: finds his way to a chair in the center of the room, away from everything except a nearby table holding a fire extinguisher and a first aid kit, both at less than arm's reach. Unshaven, a week and a half's growth, and unkept, Alex looks horrible. An anxious zombie, especially in the dim glow of the lantern. Dark circles, from lack of sleep. Thin, from lack of food. Pale, from lack of sunlight. He places workman's gloves on his hands before picking up a can of Underwood chicken spread. With some degree of difficulty, he works the gloves beneath the tab and pulls. Careful not to cut himself, he reaches out and drops the lid into a small trash can. Alex removes the gloves and, with a plastic spoon, begins to eat. CAMERA PUSHES IN as he begins to chew methodically, chewing and chewing and chewing with concentration until. after steadying himself. prepares to swallow. then, carefully does. Pause. he's alright. He takes the spoon. Scoops some more. And the process begins again.
WIDER: Clear sighs, frightened as she tosses the test upon a half dozen other discarded tests. You can never be too sure. Outside, WIND of an approaching storm blows. CAMERA tensely INCHES IN ON Clear.
ALEX: tenses. He doesn't look to where the can has been, but where it is going.
FISHING HOOK: falls, hooking a closet door. The door begins to swing open.
ALEX: is quickly out of his safe chair, hustling towards.
THE DOOR: Alex slams the door shut before it can open. Behind the door, a CRASH as something falls. Alex cracks a wicked half smile, cocky he has caught Death before this attempt has brought to fruition. Alex removes the hook from the door and places the pole on the floor. He cautiously opens the door, REVEALING an old fish scaling knife embedded on the back side of the door, unaware. Removing the knife and securing it, his eyes turn towards the floor.
CLOSET FLOOR: a tackle box has spilled thick, rusted old treble and aberdeen fishing hooks upon the floor. Alex bends down and examines them.
ALEX: ( as if to Death ) Rusted. Tetanus. Nice touch. ( defiant ) I overlooked it. You tried to capitalize. But I caught you, you fuck. I can beat you. Not forever, but I got this cabin rigged to beat you NOW!
COLEMAN LANTERN: a draft creeps beneath the glass enclosure. The flame, dancing.
CLEAR: As CAMERA PUSHES INTO HER. considering life. Then, now and what is to come.
WEINE: She was up there a minute ago.
CLEAR: I'm not turning him in. There's another life that needs him now.
CLEAR: I go with you.
WEINE: You can't.
CLEAR: Don't hurt him.
WEINE: Tell us where he is. Wait at home,
ALEX: his expression reflects a terrifying revelation.
ALEX: I. never moved. Christa asked me to move, but I didn't change seats. I would've moved up. next to Tod. How could I not remember. that. I never moved. Clear's seat was in front of mine.
SCHRECK: EXT. CABIN - NIGHT - WEINE'S POV - THROUGH CAR WINDOW Full sprint, Alex disappears into the dark forest.
WIDER: the cars BRAKE to a stop, SKIDDING in the dirt. Sheriffs leap out of their vehicles. High powered flashlights shoot beams in Alex's direction. The officers take after the suspect.
THE DOG: Helpless, chain wrapped around the tree. THUNDER RUMBLES.
CLEAR: continues to run.
CLEAR: the metal poles punge into the ground just before and behind her, inches from impaling her. She stumbles, but quickly steps aside and continues toward the tree.
CLEAR: reaches the tree and begins unfastening the dog's collar from the chain.
THE RIVETS: holding the pool frame begin to BREAK and POP. Water floods into the yard.
GULLY: He rolls and tumbles uncontrollably down the hillside. As he nears the base.
ALEX: stops with a CRUNCHING THUD. his face an inch from being impaled by a sharp, thick protruding branch. No time to catch his breath, he's up and running.
TREE: Clear drops the chain and hits the dog on its backside.
CLEAR: The dog starts to tear off toward the house. Clear runs toward the hanging tire. Leaps.
CLEAR: in mid-air, desperately grabs the tire, hanging on, literally for her life. O.S., the dog YELPS. Clear turns back.
ALEX: races along the path of the stream.
SHERIFFS: continue their pursuit through the dark trees.
ABOVE: Lightning CRACKS a tree branch. SPARKS FLY! The tree tumbles down the branches.
ALEX: The thick branch falls from above, landing on top of him. He's knocked to the ground and pinned. face down in the creek. CAMERA MOVES IN. his nose and mouth, just below the water line, but he cannot move. His eyes flash with panic, as he struggles. battles to move and avoid drowning in two inches of water. As he struggles in the f.g., Weine and a pair of Sheriffs appear ten yards beyond him. They pause, confused, panning their flashlights across the forest.
ALEX: struggles to raise his head above the water, chest bursting.
CLEAR: straining in the storm, begins moving up the branch.
WEINE: ( into radio ) Lost him.
SCHRECK: From the direction. there's only
GARAGE DOOR: as the rear of the car makes impact with the door.
GARAGE FLOOR: the can SMACKS on the floor, edgewise, REVREALING the can is sealed tight with a cap.
ALEX: Don't move!
WIDER: The power line sadistically rests atop the automobile. The exposed end of the cable flutters and whips like a cat's tail, SPARKING, CRACKLING, as it hits the ground.
ALEX: You're grounded in the car. Don't touch anything. DON'T MOVE.
WEINE: Alex, get away from there!
SCHRECK: Any part of that line touches you, you're dead.
ALEX: lurches back.
ALEX: backs away, eyes locked with Clear's, assuring she's remaining in the car.
CLEAR: keeps her eyes locked on Alex, watching him. Suddenly, a BURST OF FIRE FLASHES FROM BELOW FRAME.
ALEX: reacts, shocked. He realizes.
WIDER: the underbelly of the Corolla has ignited from the stream of combustible fluid.
ALEX: steps closer.
ALEX: CAMERA PUSHES IN ON ALEX as he quickly considers, then moves toward the hood of the burning car.
NO!: CAMERA PUSHES IN ON ALEX as he quickly considers, then moves toward the hood of the burning car.
WEINE: Get back! You'll both die!
ALEX: You know what to do.
CLEAR: No! No! Don't!
ALEX: When I do this.. it'll have skipped
ALEX: You know what to do. I'll always be
COROLLA: Clear opens the driver's side door and runs out, knocked to her feet as behind her the car EXPLODES.
ALEX: is engulfed in the flames.
ALEX: through the flames, as if sensing the oncoming horror, defying the image.
ALEX: He looks toward.
NO!: He looks toward.
WIDER: The power line ERUPTS! Alex disapears behind the wall of fire and sparks before falling limp on the driveway.
CLEAR: Schreck, Weine and PARAMEDICS rush to the girl. Schreck turns back, calling out to a paramedic, helplessly watching by ther burning car.
SCHRECK: Is he alive?
CLEAR'S EYES: flash open, horrified, answering the question.
THE SKY: a web of LIGHTNING CRACKS across the Heavens, as if Death was making a final angry proclamation.
DOCTOR: A little more. Little more!
CLEAR: breathes, pushes hard. Alex's parents stand on each side of her, holding her hand, wiping her forehead.
THE DOCTOR: cuts the umbilical cord.
DOCTOR: He's here. A beautiful boy.
CLEAR: I felt him! When the baby was born. I felt Alex pass through me. like the night he died.
DOCTOR: looks at the clock and reprots to an attending nurse. Another nurse cleans up the baby, wieghs him and places him in a hospital bassinet.
DOCTOR: 13th of May. 4:25 p.m.
BARBARA: Exactly a year. to the minute.
CLEAR: We beat it, Alex.
WRIST BRACLET: "Alexander Chance Browning II."
DELIVERY ROOM: CAMERA PULLS BACK. The birthing room is quiet; the people introspective. The doctors. The family. The mother and child. A room of new life, in which, each recalls a life lost. As "Long May You Run" OVERLAPS.
CLEAR: looks toward.
CLEAR: looks across the room.
CLEAR: CAMERA SETTLES, but her expression does not reflect fear. She knows Alex is here. and she smiles, tears welling in her eyes.
THE BABY: the bassinet trim settles, as if the presence is leaving. Before it fully departs.
CLEAR: the wind softly and rapidly passes over Clear. He smile remains as the room becomes still and her eyes looks across the room.
CARTER: Alex was right.
CLEAR: I believe. that's what Alex believed. But how do we know. this wasn't the design all along?
