PROLOGUE: BLACK. We HEAR the soft voice of Frances Farmer.
FRANCES: It usually worked. God became a superfather that couldn't spank me. But if I wanted a thing badly enough, He arranged it.
FRANCES: But if God loved all of His children equally, why did He bother about my red hat and let other people lose their fathers and mothers for always?
ERNEST: Bye, baby.
FRANCES: See you next weekend, Dad.
FRANCES: I began to see that He didn't have much to do about hats or people dying or anything. They happened whether He wanted them to or not, and He stayed in Heaven and pretended not to notice.
FRANCES: I wondered a little why God was such a useless thing. It seemed a waste of time to have Him. After that He became less and less, until He was.
FRANCES: I felt rather proud that I had found the truth myself, without help from anyone. It puzzled me that other people hadn't found out, too. God was gone. We had reached past Him. Why couldn't they see it? It still puzzles me.
WOMAN: You're going straight to hell, Frances
KAMINSKI: And do you think it's radical for a man to have a job and feed a family?
KAMINSKI: Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children?
KAMINSKI: Is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country?
KAMINSKI: Good! Because, Brothers, that's you!
ANNOUNCER: Seattle is in the news again as a high school junior wins a national competition and a hundred dollar prize with an essay denying God.
ANNOUNCER: This prompts civic officials to charge that left-wing politicians are encouraging atheism in the city's schools. Miss Frances Farmer was unavailable for comment, but her mother Lillian Farmer, a well-known local dietician, stepped to her daughter's defense.
ANNOUNCER: Farmer, a well-known local dietician, stepped to her daughter's defense.
LILLIAN: ( emphatically ) Frances has not turned her back on the Lord, they're just having a momentary difference of opinion. What child hasn't questioned the Lord's mysteries in order to better understand them? To paraphrase Mr. Voltaire, I may not agree with what she says, but I'll defend to the death her right to say it. Freedom of speech, unlike in the dark countries to the east, still lives in America! And in my home.
FRANCES: Hi Emma.
FRANCES: Bye Emma.
MAN'S VOICE: Frances hesitates, then turns to look: A man in his twenties whom we recognize as Harry York, Kaminski's compatriot, leaves a group of men in front of the union hall and walks toward her.
HARRY: ( friendly ) C'mere. I wanna talk to you.
HARRY: Momma told ya not to speak to strangers, huh? Don't touch me.
FRANCES: Don't touch me.
HARRY: I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna Okay then.
FRANCES: ( waiting ) Okay then.
HARRY: Well. you're causin' trouble, you know that?
FRANCES: I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
HARRY: Not me. But other people seem to.
FRANCES: Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers nobody'd even know about it.
HARRY: Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
FRANCES: ( examining him ) No. Actually, you look more like a
HARRY: That's rich. Hey, if I was a cop, I'd be packing, right? You see a gun? Go on, search me. Pat me down. I'll. take your word for it. So who are you, then?
FRANCES: I'll. take your word for it. So who are you, then?
HARRY: Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
FRANCES: ( smiles him ) Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
HARRY: ( embarrassed ) Yeah, well
FRANCES: You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski.
HARRY: Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you?
FRANCES: Whattaya mean?
HARRY: Well. see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist
FRANCES: But I'm not. The newspapers're
HARRY: Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy.
FRANCES: Yeah. Could look bad for you and Kaminski too, I guess. Sure don't talk like you're sixteen.
HARRY: Sure don't talk like you're sixteen.
FRANCES: Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.
HARRY: I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.
FRANCES: Well. I'll give it a try, Mr. York.
HARRY: ( hesitates, nods )
FRANCES: ( hesitates, nods )
HARRY: She nods shyly and starts up the path toward the house.
HARRY: ( admiring her ) Sure don't walk like sixteen, neither.
HILLIER: These are perilous times. With the economic collapse comes hopelessness and desperation; and people turn to dangerous ideas
WOMAN'S VOICE: I know. Those of us who represent law and order must be vigilant. Who's behind this, her mother?
HILLIER: Those of us who represent law and order must be vigilant. Who's behind this, her mother?
STYLES: Impossible. As her attorney, I've known her for years.
HILLIER: What about the father, he's a little pink. Maybe he wants to show our schools in a bad light, shift some support to Kaminski and those jackals.
STYLES: ( shaking her head ) He's no influence; he doesn't even live at home. No, I think Frances wrote that essay with no mischief intended. It was her teacher who entered it in the competition.
HILLIER: Well, the publicity must stop. It's no good for Seattle and no good for the country. Keep an eye on this, will you, Alma?
STYLES: Of course, your honor.
ERNEST: It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.
LILLIAN: I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent.
LILLIAN: ( offering to Ernest ) ( taking a piece ) Thank you.
ERNEST: ( taking a piece ) Thank you.
LILLIAN: When's the last time you saw a hundred dollars, Ernest Farmer?

ERNEST: I'm. I'm really proud of you, Thanks, Dad.
FRANCES: Thanks, Dad.
ERNEST: An essay contest. a national contest. That's pretty impressive.
FRANCES: I didn't have much to do with it.
ERNEST: You wrote it, didn't you?
FRANCES: Yeah, I suppose. Dad, who's Harry Well, Harry York is a guy who. well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?
ERNEST: Well, Harry York is a guy who. well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?
FRANCES: He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
ERNEST: Yeah. well. it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and. well. There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get Is Kaminski a Communist?
FRANCES: Is Kaminski a Communist?
ERNEST: No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little He's a socialist, then?
FRANCES: He's a socialist, then?
FRANCES: And I can't understand how it can hurt to be honest, but the more I tried to explain
LILLIAN: Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, Yes, Ma.
FRANCES: Yes, Ma.
LILLIAN: And you. should be proud. You won that contest and made a name for
LILLIAN: You're poisoning that child's mind.
ERNEST: I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve.
LILLIAN: You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents
ERNEST: They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
LILLIAN: How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!
ERNEST: ( sadly ) No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
LILLIAN: That's right. I can't understand a man who puts strangers over his family, a man who gives up a good career to become a shiftless inkhorn I'm going back to the hotel.
ERNEST: I'm going back to the hotel.
LILLIAN: See you next weekend?
ERNEST: See you next weekend?
LILLIAN: As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.
ERNEST: Lillian. I'm more than willing to meet you halfway.
LILLIAN: Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
ERNEST: ( under his breath ) That's a thought, Lil. That sure is a thought.
NEIGHBOR'S VOICE: Are you all right, dear?
LILLIAN: I'm fine, perfectly fine.

We shall hear the angels, we shall see the whole sky all diamonds, we shall see how all earthly evil, all our sufferings, are drowned in the mercy that will fill the whole world. And our life will grow peaceful, tender, sweet as a caress. Poor, dear Uncle Vanya, you are In your life you haven't known what joy was; but wait, Uncle Vanya, wait. We shall rest. We shall rest!

DRAMA TEACHER: Art is a constant struggle. Some of you have the will but not the ability. For others, the opposite. I don't wish to be harsh, but only one of you on stage tonight combined the
DRAMA TEACHER: On cue.
GIRL #1: I could really learn to hate her.
GIRL #2: Stand in line.
DRAMA TEACHER: This is the answer: a subscription drive to "Voice of Action!" First prize is a trip to Moscow! You could visit the art theatre, maybe even meet Stanislavski!
FRANCES: But I'll never win that.
DRAMA TEACHER: Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.
FRANCES: ( intrigued ) New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!
DRAMA TEACHER: New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!
FRANCES: ( flattered/embarrassed ) Thank you.
FRANCES: Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?
HARRY: You think I'd miss it?
FRANCES: Well? What'd you think?
HARRY: ( shrugs ) I just wanted to see how you looked.
FRANCES: How'd I look?
HARRY: ( teasing ) ( smiling ) Don't be a rat, Harry.
FRANCES: ( smiling ) Don't be a rat, Harry.
HARRY: You looked okay. Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I take you home?
HARRY: Honest. When you were up there, you were really. there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.
FRANCES: I don't know. I did. feel different. Alive.
HARRY: Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it.
FRANCES: Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though. to New York, especially. but I wanted to do You're not the quiet type, Frances.
HARRY: You're not the quiet type, Frances.
FRANCES: You're not the quiet type, Frances.
HARRY: You're not the quiet type, Frances.
HARRY: You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there.
FRANCES: What happened to him?
HARRY: He retired to Florida. made a killing in vending machines.
HARRY: I kick myself sometimes, but the thing is, I would have been miserable living his life.
FRANCES: .So you think I should go.
HARRY: Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
FRANCES: I don't know, Harry. I. I want so You don't know what you want.

LILLIAN: Communists?! No daughter of mine is going to Communist Russia!
FRANCES: You act like I'm a bomb-thrower, Mama. It's just a trip.
LILLIAN: But they're using you!
FRANCES: Oh Ma, they're not using me. It's just a chance to travel, see things. Besides, it's the only way I can get to New York.
LILLIAN: I'll pay your way to New York. I'll work, I'll slave. I'll sell my vegetables to the truck farmers, or

LILLIAN: Little sister, if you don't wise up soon, it's going to be out of my

FRANCES: I don't care.
LILLIAN: ( grimacing ) .You will.
FRANCES: What do I do, Dad?
ERNEST: You really want to go?
FRANCES: Of course.
ERNEST: And you think it's worth all this?
FRANCES: If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
ERNEST: .Then go.
LILLIAN: ( almost conspiratorial ) The authorities tell me there's no legal way I can stop her, but the way I see it, it's bigger than me or my family. ( the following is heard faintly as b.g. to the scene below ) American integrity, that's what's at stake here. They're sending my daughter to the heartland of darkness. . .the dark forces that would overthrow our country. Your country. My country.
REPORTER #1: Has your earlier denial of God led you to Communism?
FRANCES: I'm not a Communist.
REPORTER #2: But Frances, you said
FRANCES: I said all countries are of cultural interest. Besides, Russia has the greatest theatre company in the world.
REPORTER #2: Better than any American company?

FIRST REPORTER: What do you say now, Mrs. Farmer?
STAGE: Below this is a magazine advertisement showing Frances in a glossy Chesterfield ad. Her hair is swept up off her head, and she looks glamorous, artificial, very different from how we've seen her. Lillian takes up the paste brush and liberally swabs the opposite blank page of her scrapbook. A handwritten letter from Frances lies beside her. She removes a clipping from the letter and spreads it out. The clipping says: "STARS OF TOMORROW" and shows a semi-circle of girl's faces inside garish stars. Lillian circles Frances' photo and sits back to admire it.
PUBLICIST: The camera clicks.
FRANCES: Oh, I swim some. play the piano badly. and I read like a fiend: I like history.
PUBLICIST: No, no, people don't want that. Now listen: you spend lots of time at the beach. You're crazy about dancing. And you're the kind of girl who's just a little in love with love. Get it? Now try again? Hobbies?

PUBLICIST: ( coming up to Claire ) Not much to work with. How's this: ( reading ) 'The most interesting thing about Frances Farmer is that her road to Hollywood was 12,000 miles long. After winning a beauty contest, the first prize of which was a trip to Europe.' She made some deal with the Commies and went to Moscow, but I'm not going to say that, am I?
CLAIRE: Heavens no. Go on.
PUBLICIST: Um. 'Miss Farmer returned to New York City and had a brief fling with the Broadway stage before coming west to seek stardom.'
CLAIRE: 'Brief fling?'
PUBLICIST: Well, actually she couldn't get hired, but lucky for her, some guy in our New York office saw her. She says soon as she gets a stake, she's going

FRANCES: Dick, I can't even breathe here.
DICK: Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!
FRANCES: ( softly, remembering ) I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.
DICK: I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.

CLURMAN: The Group is more than a theatre company. It's the embodiment of an ideal. Our approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense, a creative individual and an instrument of change. You see
FRANCES: ( watching Odets ) Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.
CLURMAN: Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female Who is she?
FRANCES: Who is she?
ODETS: She's a tramp from Newark.
CLURMAN: Forgive me, but I think you'd be perfect for the part.
ODETS: Miss Farmer, for me this is not a play: it's an assault. a seduction. a plea for understanding. I think we live in a time when new art works should shoot bullets. and you make very attractive
FRANCES: And what's the title of this seduc. 'Golden Boy.'
ODETS: ( mysterious, intimate ) 'Golden Boy.'
FRANCES: He nods.
FRANCES: You wanted to talk?
ODETS: You see that girl?
ODETS: That's who my play is about.

ODETS: I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
FRANCES: Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
ODETS: Good. Then it's very simple. You have to stop being afraid, Frances. It's in you.
ODETS: I can see it. You just have to let it out. Trust it. No one will quash you here, but it's still a fight, a struggle! Being true to your art, being honest, is always a struggle!
CLURMAN: .Not only an artist, but an instrument of change. We must look to the world around us, not content to observe, but to take an active hand in redressing its wrongs. We will not stand idly by as Fascist bombs obliterate democracy. We contribute our profits, for if fascism is not stopped in Spain, it will spread across Europe, jeopardizing the struggle of civilized man to
FRANCES: I'm not afraid of struggle, Clifford.
CLIFFORD: Yes you are. We all are. The first step is to acknowledge our fear.
CLIFFORD: Face it! Confess it! You're weak!
FRANCES: I'm not!
CLIFFORD: You're afraid!
FRANCES: I'm not!

CLIFFORD: Good, good. Give them that.
FRANCES: As she feels the anger coursing through her body she realizes what he's talking about. She looks at him, still breathing heavily. Gradually her face turns toward a smile. He reaches out and, with exquisite tenderness, kisses her.
CLIFFORD: Thank you. Oh my God! Frances, I'm such a cad. I can't go through with this. My wife is in Europe, but this is her her bedroom. I can't ask you to.
FRANCES: Thank you. Oh my God! Frances, I'm such a cad. I can't go through with this. My wife is in Europe, but this is her her bedroom. I can't ask you to.

REPORTER: Hold it a second, Bub.
WOMAN: .and we feel that this would be more appropriate.
JUDGE: .a difficult decision, but, I'm sure, the proper one.
FRANCES: She feels an arm slip around her shoulders and she stiffens. Her mother's face appears by hers.
LILLIAN: ( whispering ) It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.
FRANCES: Mama, what's.
LILLIAN: Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need.
FRANCES: You're taking me home!
LILLIAN: ( smiling ) First things first, little sister. Trust me.
OMITTED: EXT. ENTRANCE DRIVE - DAY A wood-panelled station wagon turns the corner of a tree- lined road and heads up toward tall wrought-iron gates. On a white-washed wall are black letters: "MEADOW WOOD CONVALESCENT HOME". The Station wagon, a similar sign on its door, pulls up. The gates swing slowly open, and it travels up a long tree-lined driveway. As it goes by, we see Frances sitting in the back seat between Lillian and one of the Women from the previous scene. The car heads up toward a large Spanish-style building set back among some trees.
LILLIAN: Why it's beautiful here! What a view!
MAN: Good afternoon, Miss Farmer. I'm Dr.
LILLIAN: Good afternoon, Doctor. I'm very pleased to meet you, Mrs. Farmer. I'm sure we'll have more of a chance to talk later. Right now I think it's important that your daughter have a chance to settle in. Perhaps it would be best if you said your goodbyes here. Oh. Well, I have some background that you should probably know about if you're.
SYMINGTON: I'm very pleased to meet you, Mrs. Farmer. I'm sure we'll have more of a chance to talk later. Right now I think it's important that your daughter have a chance to settle in. Perhaps it would be best if you said your goodbyes here. Oh. Well, I have some background that you should probably know about if you're.
LILLIAN: Oh. Well, I have some background that you should probably know about if you're.
SYMINGTON: I have no doubt, Mrs. Farmer. If you'll speak to the girl at the desk, she'll arrange an appointment.
LILLIAN: I'll be back real soon, little sister. You be a good girl.
FRANCES: ( staring out window )
FRANCES: ( warningly ) .I want to go home, Mama. You'll see, little sister. Everything will be fine. The doctors know best.
LILLIAN: You'll see, little sister. Everything will be fine. The doctors know best.
SYMINGTON: I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance.
FRANCES: Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
SYMINGTON: Thanks are hardly necessary.
FRANCES: Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
SYMINGTON: I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
FRANCES: It ain't for lack of trying.
SYMINGTON: So it seems. May we be serious for a Why, Doctor! We've only just met!
FRANCES: ( seductively ) Why, Doctor! We've only just met!
SYMINGTON: I feel I've known you for a long time. you see, I've followed your career. you're a fascinating case. I'm looking forward to resolving your predicament.
FRANCES: Oh! Are you really?
SYMINGTON: Among persons such as yourself, creative people under great stress, erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of. It's just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which.
FRANCES: Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?
SYMINGTON: Please sit down.
FRANCES: You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
SYMINGTON: I see.
FRANCES: Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.
SYMINGTON: And what's that?
FRANCES: Normal. Average.
SYMINGTON: All right. Will you please sit down Symington says.
FRANCES: .Did you really say that?
SYMINGTON: Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
FRANCES: This whole thing is a joke!
SYMINGTON: Stay calm, please.
FRANCES: No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you? Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions. after we know each other a little better. and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"
SYMINGTON: I'll have someone show you to your Oh, that's good, very professional. In control. But the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you
FRANCES: Oh, that's good, very professional. In control. But the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you
SYMINGTON: You really should get some rest now. Nurse will meet you outside. Good
SYMINGTON: Is there something else?
FRANCES: You didn't say 'Symington says'.
SYMINGTON: Symington says.
LILLIAN: Not much on hospital corners, are You Farmer?
MATRON: You Farmer?
FRANCES: So this is the nuthouse.
NURSE: Honey. take my word for it. This is a resort.
LILLIAN: Tell them who I am! Tell them who I Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!
FRANCES: Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!
FRANCES: You've got to tell me what it is!
THIN NURSE: It's insulin. It throws your body into shock.
LILLIAN: .and here's the one from Duluth. A war widow with five children. She works in a defense plant and she's very worried about you. I answered her that she shouldn't let worry over you affect her vital work; and that you'd be back on the silver screen in no time. And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that.
LILLIAN: And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that.
FRANCES: Why are these all opened?
LILLIAN: Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.
FRANCES: Then why did you bring them?
LILLIAN: It's your fan mail, little sister.
FRANCES: ( looking off, under her breath ) You kill me, Mama.
LILLIAN: Go on.
FRANCES: Go on.
SYMINGTON: .I'm sorry to keep you waiting, the staff review ran over. Did you enjoy your mother's visit?
FRANCES: ( sitting ) Yes. It was very good to see her.
SYMINGTON: Really? Any problems?
FRANCES: Not at all. She brought me my fan I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.
SYMINGTON: You're telling me you feel guilty.
FRANCES: ( slightly edgy ) No. What I mean is. I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.
SYMINGTON: ( after a pause ) Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?
FRANCES: ( laughing ) She told me you said, "Mama, you want to kill me."
SYMINGTON: She told me you said, "Mama, you want to kill me."
FRANCES: I never said. Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said.
SYMINGTON: And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
FRANCES: Oh for Christ's. I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?
FRANCES: I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?
SYMINGTON: But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?
FRANCES: Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.
SYMINGTON: Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the staff review.
FRANCES: You what?
SYMINGTON: Mental illness is an elusive thing, and though I'm pleased you're feeling more. capable, it's perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time. Don't you agree?
SYMINGTON: ( smiling ) I'm sure you'll see it my way in the Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
FRANCES: Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
SYMINGTON: 'Cause if it's long enough, which I doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!
FRANCES: 'Cause if it's long enough, which I doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!
FRANCES: I want outta here, you understand? I'm ready to get out! So you go back there. you go back and you tell them to let me out!
SYMINGTON: ( calmly ) Frances, I'm warning you.
FRANCES: No, I'm warning you! Who do you think you are, God? You bumble around with your folders. .and your pencils. .and your god-damn buttons. .all your badges of authority! But you have no authority! You're nothing! You're a zero!
ORDERLY: Symington sits forward, his hands smoothing his hair. Frances smiles sarcastically at him:
FRANCES: Symington says.
SYMINGTON: ( tonelessly ) Sedate her.
FRANCES: Oh my God, I look awful.
HARRY: ( friendly ) You've looked a whole lot better.
FRANCES: They're doin' stuff to me, Harry. Can you see it? You feel it? They're putting stuff in my food or something, my water, and they're using it to put thoughts in my head. You understand? They're trying to re- arrange what's in my head, they're trying to drive me crazy! Oh, Harry!
FRANCES: I can't stay here anymore, you understand? I can't, I can't. I gotta get home. I gotta get somewhere else, anywhere, okay?
ATTENDANT: Oh, Miss Farmer! Time for your bath, Miss Farmer!
HARRY: ( urgent whisper ) Listen: to the left. Straight through the trees and over the wall to your left. My car is there.
ATTENDANT: ( as if to a child ) It's time for your bath!
FRANCES: Oh good. I love my baths.
ATTENDANT: Come along now.
HARRY: Frances! Did you hear what I said?
FRANCES: Of course, Harry.
FRANCES: ( fiercely ) Over the walls!
HARRY: You want crazy? I'll show you crazy!
HARRY: ( offering to lift her )
HARRY: Evening, gorgeous.
FRANCES: ( yawning ) That sure looks like fun. ( leaning over front seat ) You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel?
HARRY: Forget it, Frances. You're not Have I told you how mean you're turning, York?
FRANCES: Have I told you how mean you're turning, York?
FRANCES: Where are we, mean man?
HARRY: Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with a ranch.
FRANCES: I should've known.
HARRY: This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone.
FRANCES: This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone.
HARRY: That's right.
FRANCES: ( smiling ) .Take advantage of me.
FRANCES: I don't think I'd be much good in a Whattaya think you're in now?
HARRY: Whattaya think you're in now?
FRANCES: ( sleepily ) I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a. a misapprehension A misunderstanding, people taking the wrong meaning from things. I wasn't declaring war, Harry. I was just saying my prayers.
HARRY: A misunderstanding, people taking the wrong meaning from things. I wasn't declaring war, Harry. I was just saying my prayers.
FRANCES: A misunderstanding, people taking the wrong meaning from things. I wasn't declaring war, Harry. I was just saying my prayers.
HARRY: Who to? Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama.
FRANCES: Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama.
HARRY: Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.
FRANCES: ( sitting up ) No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
HARRY: Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's
FRANCES: You know something, Harry?
HARRY: I guess.
FRANCES: Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
HARRY: What's that?
FRANCES: You can't drink.
FRANCES: ( wincing/grinning ) Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch!
HARRY: ( calling drunkenly ) Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me!
FRANCES: What a man!
HARRY: Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of To quarter-horses.
FRANCES: ( hoisting her glass ) To quarter-horses.
HARRY: No. To thoroughbreds.
THE JUKEBOX: A hand puts a nickel in, and we HEAR Bing Crosby singing "Love Is So Terrific." We PAN across the dance floor, where Harry and Frances are dancing.
BING'S VOICE: Love is so terrific Such a funny feeling Makes you want to cuddle And
FRANCES: Why are you always leaving me, Harry?
HARRY: You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.
FRANCES: You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.
HARRY: Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?
FRANCES: ( after a long pause ) I know a thing or two about marriage. You. you understand me more than anyone, Harry. maybe even more than Mama. But. you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you ( a bitter smile ) Well. I'll act like I do until I
HARRY: ( a bitter smile ) Well. I'll act like I do until I
HARRY: There's just one more thing.
FRANCES: What's that?
HARRY: Will you marry me?

HARRY: It's not too late to keep going, up to Vancouver? Be the smartest thing.
FRANCES: Thanks, Harry, really, but. I can't explain it. She's my mother. She's just. I can't give up on her that You give up on her?
HARRY: You give up on her?
FRANCES: Yeah. It's just. something I gotta do, I guess.
HARRY: ( smiling warmly ) Frances, You're crazy.
FRANCES: ( whispers ) I know. Don't tell anyone.
HARRY: Anyway. if you need me.
FRANCES: ( warmly ) I got your number, Mister Man.
LILLIAN: ( nervous, forced ) Welcome home, little sister.
FRANCES: Well, who have we here.?
LILLIAN: ( anxiously ) Frances, you remember my lawyer, Alma Styles?
STYLES: Hello, Frances. You seem to be having quite a time of it.
LILLIAN: I called Alma because I think we'll Frances, the doctors at Meadow Wood have petitioned the court for your return. Your mother has asked me to intervene so you can stay here.

FRANCES: It's okay, Mama. It's okay.

OMITTED: INT. JUDGE'S CHAMBERS Judge Hillier walking. out of the chamber and down a corridor. His stride is long, his demeanor purposeful. The corridor leads into a courtroom. Harry standing at attention. We hear Hillier climb onto the bench and be introduced by the court official. Harry stares up at the judge.
HILLIER: Alvin Hanson, a.k.a. Ronald Burns, Thomas Slocum, Harry York. Mr. Hanson, this warrant has been outstanding for many years. Normally that circumstance would prompt me toward leniency, but the crime you committed inciting to riot and the cause you sought to promote a worker's rebellion are such anathemas to this court that I feel compelled to mete out the full sentence. I only wish it were longer. Six months in the state penitentiary.
LILLIAN: Frances, play 'Flow Gently Sweet
FRANCES: Oh Mama, I'm so. tired of that Please. I want you to. It would make me so happy.
LILLIAN: Please. I want you to. It would make me so happy.
LILLIAN: It's just a flow gently sweet Afton day. Life has been so good to me. Why, I have just about everything one could wish. but I still have so many blank pages in my scrapbook.
FRANCES: I think I need a little air.
LILLIAN: What's wrong?
FRANCES: Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
LILLIAN: Where are you going?
FRANCES: For a walk, Mama. Just a walk.

FRANCES: Yes, Mama.
FRANCES: .So what do you think?
ERNEST: I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.
FRANCES: I know that, Dad, but
ERNEST: What you have to understand, Francie, is that she. well. she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to. The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers. but she could have been. if times were different she could have been a politician or. I don't know.
FRANCES: But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
ERNEST: ( after a pause ) Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got. or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.
FRANCES: Dad. whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
ERNEST: Always. Always.
ERNEST: I'm sorry, I. I don't have a desk in my room, and.

LILLIAN: ( coming into hall ) Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who
FRANCES: ( excited ) Wait, Mama, wait. I have something to tell you. I've decided. well. I'm not going to make movies anymore. I thought that's what I wanted, and I went after it with all my soul, the way you taught me, but I was miserable, Mama, and it nearly killed me. So now. now it's over. I want a different kind of life, something. simple. I want to live someplace quiet and peaceful. in the country maybe, and I'll have dogs and cats I feel so light suddenly, so clear for the first time in. It's going to be okay, Mama, I know it. And I love you.
LILLIAN: ( coming down stairs ) Don't. talk crazy.
FRANCES: ( entering living room ) They want you back! Your agent called today! Don't you understand? He's sending the scripts. He wants to fly up here in a week with the publicity people!

FRANCES: I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!

LILLIAN: Where are you going?
FRANCES: I'm going out!
LILLIAN: You're not going anywhere!
FRANCES: Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.

DR. DOYLE: ( bored ) Yes, yes, Mrs. Farmer
ALMA STYLES: Frances has always been a battleground, Lillian.
DOYLE: The point is: it's your opinion that Frances is getting steadily worse?
LILLIAN: Well. yes.
DOYLE: And you feel you're unable to control her any longer?
LILLIAN: No. I mean, yes, Doctor.
DOYLE: And the only course open to you is to commit your daughter for a period of time to a mental institution?
LILLIAN: Well, Alma told me that.
LILLIAN: Hillier nods slightly, approvingly, toward Alma.
DOYLE: ( closing his folder ) I believe that's all I need to know about Miss Farmer.
HILLIER: I think in all future documents she should be referred to as Mrs. R. H. Her married name?
LILLIAN: Her married name?
HILLIER: Yes. It's less recognizable. I'm sure you'd prefer to keep unpleasant publicity to a minimum.
LILLIAN: .Oh yes.
HILLIER: Now. Can you tell us where we might find Frances?
FRANCES: .Looking for a drink, and the town is deserted, he can't understand it. Finally he finds a bar, goes in the place is empty, bartender's closing up. Salesman says, 'Gimme a martini.' Bartender's real nervous, he says, 'No, no, no, I gotta close. Big Otis is coming to town.'
FRANCES: Salesman says, 'I don't care. I gotta have a martini.' So the bartender fixes him a martini real fast, grabs his money, and runs out the back. Salesman sits there sipping his martini,. he's got the bar all to himself. Then he hears it. This big roaring in the street.
RRRAAAAAAA!!!: ( stomping her feet ) Gigantic footsteps. coming closer.
FRANCES: Enormous hands reach in, grab the swinging doors and rip them off their hinges. This huge man stomps in. Picks up a chair and hurls it over the bar, smashing the mirror whiskey and glass flying everywhere.
FRANCES: He turns to the salesman: 'What the hell're you doing in here!' Salesman says, 'I'm just drinking a martini.' 'Oh yeah?' the guy says. 'Well you better get outa here! Big Otis is coming to town!'
DOYLE: .From her history, it's apparent the patient suffers from a paranoid reaction with pronounced egotism. Her violent responses have recently included aggression against her mother. In view of the deep-seated nature of her ailments and her failure to respond satisfactorily to insulin shock, it is my opinion she may ultimately require permanent institutional care.
HILLIER: ( to Styles ) Counsellor, as Guardian ad litem for Mrs. Richardson, do you waive jury Yes, your Honor.
STYLES: Yes, your Honor.
HILLIER: Having heard the testimony of a legally qualified and reputable physician. and being further satisfied of the truth of all matters set forth in the certificates of said physician, I do hereby order that the said Mrs. R. H. Richardson, an insane person, be confined to the Western State Hospital for the Insane at Steilacoom.
HILLIER: So ordered! Are the gentlemen from Steilacoom present?
DOCTOR #1: What's she getting, anyway?
DOCTOR #2: Standard series to start.
DOCTOR #1: Doctor #2 nods and jams a rubber bar into Frances' mouth. The Medical Student steps forward.
STUDENT: Can I push the button on this one?
DOCTOR #2: The Medical Student pushes the button with great gravity. Frances' body immediately begins to convulse. It seems as if it will never stop.
FRANCES: ( speaking with difficulty ) Doctor, it may sound odd, but I believe I've profited from my stay here. It's just what I've needed, to get away like this. But I'm recuperated now. I've had lots of time to think and I've made a few decisions about my life. I'm ready to get on with it.
DOYLE: I know you believe that.
FRANCES: .Don't you?
DOYLE: I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense?
FRANCES: No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.
DOYLE: ( smiling ) Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
FRANCES: ( tightly ) You. I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
DOYLE: Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
FRANCES: .I see.
DOYLE: We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
FRANCES: One question. If I'm not myself now, just who do you think I am?
DOYLE: We'll talk.
FRANCES: What the hell!
CHANT: Come and get it! Come and get it! Come and get it!
CHANT: We want Frances! We want Frances!

HARRY: I love you too, Frances.

FRANCES: I couldn't relate to others in a normal way.
ONE PATIENT: ( playful warning ) She's. not. normal.!
FRANCES: And I was not taking responsibility for my actions. But now, thanks to your treatment, I feel ready to face myself, ready to resume the career which I so single-handedly shattered. I only hope. I hope I can make you all proud of me. Thank you. Thank you so much.
LILLIAN: Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind.
FRANCES: No. No, it all depends on what offers I get.
REPORTER: Who did your hair, Frances?

FRANCES: No, Mama, I'll take care of it. I'll wash them in the morning.

HARRY: Where to?
FRANCES: Oh Harry.
HARRY: This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance, you better take it.
FRANCES: Yeah. I don't know.
HARRY: You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need I know, but. There were so many people in there, Harry. Every time I turned around someone was pressing against me. watching, looking over my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, sticking things into me. When I feel somebody near me now. anybody. my skin starts to crawl.
FRANCES: I know, but. There were so many people in there, Harry. Every time I turned around someone was pressing against me. watching, looking over my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, sticking things into me. When I feel somebody near me now. anybody. my skin starts to crawl.
FRANCES: You can't change the things they did to me, Harry. Only I can do that. by myself.
HARRY: Been a lot of years, you know. A long time waiting. For what? End up feeling like a sap.
FRANCES: Oh please, Harry. don't even think it. You're the only person who ever. It's just. Can't you wait for me?

FRANCES: Dad.? Why don't you stop at a side road and let me out?

FRANCES: Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me They'll just catch you again, Francie. Besides, your mother will know.
ERNEST: They'll just catch you again, Francie. Besides, your mother will know.

FRANCES: No! All you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! But I'm not you, mother, and I never will be, and thank god for it! That goes for you too! And frankly, I don't know how, with the two of you, I turned out as sane as I am Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be with you in a minute. and believe me, I don't want to stay here one second longer than I have to! But I've got to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. In shame!
LILLIAN: But what
FRANCES: No! You're not talking now. You listen. You can send me away, Lillian, you can pretend I'm crazy and pretend I'm still your little girl who can't take care of herself, but one thing you can't pretend anymore. You can't pretend I love you because I don't. I can't. Not after what you've done to me. Because you see. I'm still me. I'm trying real hard all this time to be me. and you, 'little sister', you haven't been any help at all. Okay, boys, I'm ready.
FRANCES: We shall hear the angels, we shall see the whole sky all diamonds.
SOLDIER #1: .Best deal I ever made. Twenty bucks to fuck a fuckin' movie star.
SOLDIER #2: Yeah, it's worth it I guess.
SOLDIER #1: What's she saying, anyway?
SOLDIER #2: Who knows. She's crazy, ain't she?
OLDER NURSE: I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.
YOUNG NURSE: OLDER NURSE ( nods ) YOUNG NURSE ( wincing )
OLDER NURSE: ( nods ) I checked the files. This one holds the record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in ( wincing ) You're kidding.
YOUNG NURSE: ( wincing ) You're kidding.
OLDER NURSE: ( indicating the doctors ) Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.

THE HALL: Past other patients, doctors, etc. We see some of this from her point of view. She goes through two swinging doors, down another hall. at the end of which a man opens a door. She is pushed onto a:
STAGE: She is wheeled into a row. between two other patients. In the background we HEAR a voice:
DR. HARLINGTON: We have always known that this form of radical treatment was effective, but until now it couldn't be applied on a large scale. The old procedure required a full day's work by a surgical team to perform a single operation. In the same time, working alone, I can treat fifty.
DR. HARLINGTON: This procedure works best on patients with extreme over-reactions to emotional stimuli. It can also be used as a last resort on those who seem impervious to other forms of
DR. HARLINGTON: In plain language, my technique severs the nerves which give emotional energy to ideas. Along with the cure comes a loss of affect. a kind of emotional flattening.
DR. HARLINGTON: .with diminished creativity and imagination. Patients become like good solid cake with no icing. But, after all, it is their emotions and imaginations that are disturbed.
DR. HARLINGTON: These patients will soon be leaving the hospital.
DR. HARLINGTON: Lobotomy gets 'em home.
LILLIAN: What was I saying? Oh yes, it was the Communists that did it to Frances.
LILLIAN: They capture the mind by first seducing the heart. I suppose I never taught Frances to close her heart.
REPORTER: Uh. excuse us, Mrs. Farmer. We're going to have to. uh.
THIRD REPORTER: ( rising ) Yeah, I better pack it in too.
LILLIAN: ( distractedly ) Pardon? Oh, would you like more
FOURTH REPORTER: ( kindly ) I think we've had enough. Thank you, Mrs. Farmer. Goodbye.
LILLIAN: You know, Ernie, I think we should have Frances' room repainted for when she comes home. That'll brighten her day.
EDWARDS: .Dwayne Steele divorced you, and from this point on, your story takes a darker turn. Shunned by the Hollywood you criticized so harshly, alienated from your family and friends, you turn your back on professional commitments in New York, and alcohol and drugs enter your life. These are sad, desperate times for you.
EDWARDS: .until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances?
FRANCES: .No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one. Were you an alcoholic?
EDWARDS: .and over 200 producers have been invited to watch your appearance here tonight. so who knows, Frances Farmer, anything's possible on your comeback trail! And since your friends tell me they have to drive you everywhere, look what we've got for you!
EDWARDS: A brand new 1958 Edsel!
FRANCES: Thank you, Ralph.
EDWARDS: Thank you, Frances. And after the show we're hosting a reception for you and your friends at Hollywood's own Roosevelt Hotel! So, Frances Farmer, this is your life. Good night. God bless you. Where shall we drop you, Frances? No. no, someone's picking me up.
EDWARDS: So, Frances Farmer, this is your life. Good night. God bless you. Where shall we drop you, Frances? No. no, someone's picking me up.
WOMAN: Where shall we drop you, Frances? No. no, someone's picking me up.
FRANCES: ( vaguely ) No. no, someone's picking me up.
HARRY: C'mere. I want to talk to you.
FRANCES: ( flatly ) Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see
HARRY: How. how ya doin', Farmer?
FRANCES: Fine, thank you. Did you watch the Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
HARRY: Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
FRANCES: ( concerned ) How did I look?
HARRY: Oh, you. Well. you're looking well.
FRANCES: ( a glimmer, but she does not pick up on the cue ) Well. you're looking well.
FRANCES: I got a new car. Only it's red. Did you know Mama died?
HARRY: Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.
FRANCES: Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry.
HARRY: Why do you say that?
FRANCES: I'd ask you to take me home, but I'm a faceless sinner. .You smell good, Harry. Familiar, you know? I'd ask you to take me home, but.
HARRY: ( taking her by the arm )
FRANCES: Don't get mad at me, Harry. Please. It's just. Some things happen for the best.
FRANCES: It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?
HARRY: I'm not sure.
FRANCES: Very slow. But we're not going to stop, are we?
HARRY: ( reassured ) No, we're not. Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again.
FRANCES: ( reassured ) No, we're not. Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again.
FRANCES: Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again.
HARRY: Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
FRANCES: That would be okay.
HARRY: Just a little way.
