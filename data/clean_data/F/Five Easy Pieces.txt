CATHERINE: ( to Bobby ) How long have you been. ( To Tita ) Oh, excuse me.
TITA: No, it's all right, you go ahead.
CATHERINE: I was just going to ask Robert how long he's been away from here.
BOBBY: Four or five years.
CARL: No, the last time was three years Oh no, it's been much more than Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.

CATHERINE: And you no longer play at all?
CARL: You know, just after I came back off tour with the Betenthaller Quartet, Dad, myself and Herbert had a summit conference about Oh, my, "a summit conference." I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.
TITA: Oh, my, "a summit conference." I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.
CARL: I don't know where you were, penis I hope I didn't hear that.
TITA: I hope I didn't hear that.
CARL: At any rate, Dad wanted to hire a private detective to ferret you out, and I said, "What for?" Whatever the hell he's doing, even if it's a completely wasteful escapade, it's entirely his business. Simple as that.
BOBBY: Well, I really appreciate it, Carl.
TITA: I don't think you should infer Daddy was wrong in front of him.
BOBBY: ( to Catherine ) How long have you been staying A couple of months.
TITA: A couple of months.

TITA: He has ways of communicating, Robert. I can tell when he's expressing approval or disapproval, just from his eyes.
BOBBY: Uhm hmm. Some range.
TITA: It's not that bad.
BOBBY: Yes, it is. I can't take seeing him, sitting there like a stone.
TITA: A week or two isn't going to ruin your life, for Godsakes.
BOBBY: No, I don't. You should've left a long time ago.
TITA: We can't all get up and leave, can we? I mean, there are certain needs you have to respond to.
BOBBY: What questions?
TITA: Well, do you I mean, have you enjoyed all these. strange things you've been doing?
BOBBY: She stares at him for a moment, and taking note of

BOBBY: You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with Like what?
TITA: Like what?
BOBBY: Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or.
TITA: Oh, let's not talk about my hair, it does what it wants to, and anyway, who cares, I want to talk about you.
BOBBY: There's nothing to say, Tita.
TITA: Well, you're not going to run out on me right away, are you?
BOBBY: I don't know.
ON BOBBY: as he moves down the hallway and sees:
TITA: Oh God, don't sneak up on me like We see she wears a little make-up and has done something "different" with her hair.
BOBBY: He turns and exits the den.
CATHERINE: I guess you fell in the water.
BOBBY: I guess you fell in the water.
CATHERINE: ( amused ) Yes, intentionally.
BOBBY: That's dangerous, you know.
CATHERINE: Playing piano all day and then jumping into cold water. You could get a cramp.
BOBBY: Playing piano all day and then jumping into cold water. You could get a cramp.
CATHERINE: I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.
BOBBY: Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
CATHERINE: What would I do with it? Run amok?
BOBBY: What would I do with it? Run amok?
CATHERINE: Well, there's fishing and boating. There's concerts on the mainland and. but I feel silly telling you. This is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to do.

BOBBY: ( as if it were a year ) The day after tomorrow.
CATHERINE: If you're free.
BOBBY: Yeah, I'll probably be free.
TITA: Don't laugh.
CARL: I took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach.
CATHERINE: One thing that's hard to understand is how you could have this incredible background in music, and then just walk away from it, without a second thought.
BOBBY: I gave it a second thought.
TITA: He looks tired to me, Spicer. I think you should put him to bed.
CATHERINE: I mean, how could you not play anymore? That's so strange to me.
BOBBY: I have played a few times. Here and there. As a matter of fact, I was once a rehearsal pianist for a Las Vegas musical revue.
CATHERINE: You don't call that music, though.
BOBBY: Of course I do. It's music. You He places his hands on the table and simulates the playing of a rousing production-type show-stopper, simultaneously vocalizing as he does.

BOBBY: Yeah, well fine, you know what I suggest, Ray. Because I don't know how long. Things are not going that well He listens again, his eyes on Catberine, moving around in her room.
CARL: Only 10 minutes of playing and it's already killing my neck.
BOBBY: You sure you should be playing, What do you mean? Aside from my neck, I'm in superb shape.
CARL: What do you mean? Aside from my neck, I'm in superb shape.
BOBBY: ( serving ) I don't know, there's something wrong with the way you move.
CARL: I'm not aware of it. Like what?
BOBBY: Your serve. Two Eighteen.
CARL: ( irritated with Bobby ) I've walked across a stage a number of times, without exciting any particular response.
BOBBY: That's what I mean.
CARL: Any particular humor, I meant.
BOBBY: ( returning ) I think you should get someone to coach you how to walk. I think it's a substantial problem.
CARL: As he moves after the ball, Bobby gestures at him.
BOBBY: Look at that.
TITA: Why are you being so mean?
BOBBY: I'm not. He does walk funny. Don't you see that?
TITA: I don't think I'd notice. I'm so used to Carl.
BOBBY: ( wanting to go on about it ) Yeah, well, he's.

TITA: Sailors are sadistic, I feel.

BOBBY: At game, Carl.
CARL: All right, let's have a rematch.

CARL: Too bad. Just when I was hitting my He starts away, then turns back.
TITA: Can I play now?
CARL: Tell her I'll be back sometime Bobby turns to Tita.
BOBBY: Where is she, anyway?
TITA: ( ignoring the question ) My turn.
BOBBY: Why don't you and Spicer play?
CATHERINE'S CAR: pulling into view and parking near the garage. She gets out, and, carrying a shopping bag and a wrapped bouquet of flowers, pauses on her way to the house to have some exchange with Tita.
ON BOBBY: quickly descending the staircase, and FOLLOWING with him as he moves to the music room and goes inside, leaving the door open.
ON CATHERINE: her features intensely concentrated, as she listens to his playing.
ON BOBBY: apparently deep into the music. On the wall behind him are the series of photographs seen in the opening and the present ANGLE FAVORS an 8-year-old Bobby in his dress suit, playing a recital.
CATHERINE: That was beautiful, Robert. I'm Thank you.
BOBBY: Thank you.
CATHERINE: I was really very moved by the way Unable to keep up the "serious" musician pose, a brief, derisive laugh issues from him.
BOBBY: It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.
CATHERINE: Nothing. It's just that. I picked the easiest piece I could remember. I think I first played it when I was 8 years old and I played it better then.
BOBBY: Nothing. It's just that. I picked the easiest piece I could remember. I think I first played it when I was 8 years old and I played it better then.
CATHERINE: It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by.
BOBBY: I didn't have any.
CATHERINE: You had no inner feeling?
BOBBY: Then I must have been supplying it.
CATHERINE: Then I must have been supplying it.
BOBBY: Well, at least you're accomplished at something.
CATHERINE: Well, at least you're accomplished at something.
BOBBY: At being a fake.

BOBBY: You think I'm a fake.
CATHERINE: I think it's what you think.
BOBBY: No, it isn't what I think.
CATHERINE: Look. You made a very calculated move, and then made me feel embarrassed for responding to you. That wasn't necessary.
BOBBY: Yes, it was. You've made it clear that if I can cut a little piano, I might get a little response.
CATHERINE: ( stops and turns to him ) I don't think that's accurate.
BOBBY: Up to now, what I've been getting from you are meaningful looks over the dinner table and a lot of vague suggestions about the day after I'm not conscious of having given you any meaningful looks. And as for the day after tomorrow, this is the day after tomorrow, and I am, unfortunately, seeing you. Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to take a bath.
CATHERINE: I'm not conscious of having given you any meaningful looks. And as for the day after tomorrow, this is the day after tomorrow, and I am, unfortunately, seeing you. Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to take a bath.
BOBBY: It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?
CATHERINE: I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil.
BOBBY: Some bath oil?
CATHFRINE: What are you doing!
BOBBY: ( knocking the bottles over ) What are you doing, screwing around with this crap?!
CATHERINE: I don't find your language that It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.

CATHERINE: Yes, that's what's important to He takes her by the shoulders.
BOBBY: Okay, let's be serious.
CATHERINE: No, don't do that.
BOBBY: Shut up.
CATHERINE: No inner feeling.
BOBBY: That's right.
CATHERINE: I don't believe vou.
CATHERINE: I married him when I was 17. He was a cellist, and I thought he was the most brilliant man I'd ever met. And I'm sure he was, because at that age, I hadn't met that many. But he was insidious, you know. He had me convinced that I was a mediocrity, musically, as a woman, as an intellect. But in this completely imperceptible, pleasant way, so that you weren't even sure he was doing it. Anyway, I just woke up one morning and I said, you know something Joseph, you're full of beans, and I left him.
BOBBY: That's what you said?
CATHERINE: Something witty and devastating like that.
BOBBY: I'm fine.
CATHERINE: Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.
BOBBY: Is he?
CATHERINE: She reaches over, tentatively caressing his face,
BOBBY: Yeah, I think I could.
CATHERINE: I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.
BOBBY: I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.

RAYETTE: Well, that's a blessing, at least.
BOBBY: I don't know.
ON CARL: fascinated with Rayette, while beside him, Catherine keeps her eyes on her plate as she eats.
CARL: You've been staying in a motel all this time?
RAYETTE: For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away.
CARL: I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.
RAYETTE: Well, I was goin' to, but Bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first, which I can understand, but then it went an' took so long, I ran flat outa I didn't have no number to call, you know. So I hadda clear outa there an' come on up here, in the hopes that I wouldn't be intrudin' myself.
CARL: Oh, no. You're more than welcome.
RAYETTE: Well, thank you, that's a very nice thing for you to say.
CARL: Not at all.
RAYETTE: That certainly is a beautiful head a hair you have.

BOBBY: Oh, for chrissakes.
CARL: Robert, let's not be rude, okay?
RAYETTE: It's all right. He don't mean anything by that.
BOBBY: I don't, huh?
RAYETTE: I guess Bobby's just about the moodiest man I ever ben with.
ON BOBBY: lying huddled on the boardwalk next to the boat slips. The crying of the gulls and the sound of outgoing fishing launches awaken him. Disoriented, he gets to his feet and, hugging himself against the cold, moves unsteadily down the dock.
BOBBY: Where are you going?
CATHERINE: I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?
BOBBY: I have to talk to you.
CATHERINE: I'll be back later.

CATHERINE: Please, I'll see you later this She pulls ahead and moves onto the ferry.
SAMIA: But the point is, man is born into the world with a pre-existent adversary, both real and imaginary, so you'd have to say that aggression was one of his primary, psychic inheritances, which.
FINCHER: If I may beg to differ.
SAMIA: Beg all you like, John, but the fact remains that man takes enormous delight in aggressive acts, as well as the portrayal of aggressive acts, and to be triumphant over another no matter how, seems fundamental to his having a sense of well being, as well as.
FINCHER: No, I don't quarrel with your inference, but you draw too long a bow in your conclusions, which seem unnecessarily harsh and.
SAMIA: Well, I don't make poetry. As an analyst, I.
RAYETTE: Is there a TV in the house?
SAMIA: John believes in the basic goodness of man, and that's fine, but gaze into the pit like I have and that view seems a little soporific. And not unlike television, it hardly represents the real world.
RAYETTE: There's some good things on it, Pardon me?
SAMIA: Pardon me?
RAYETTE: The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.
SAMIA: I strongly doubt it, but I wasn't really discussing media.
FINCHER: If you really hold such bleak views, how can you, in good conscience, carry on a practice?
SAMIA: Oh, there's always hope, I think, for a few individuals, if they're courageous enough to shed their illusions and their.
CATHERINE: ( cutting her off ) And what about love?
SAMIA: What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?
CATHERINE: No, I wouldn't.
SAMIA: Well, you're a romantic, Catherine, as are most musicians, and what's more, about to be married.
ON BOBBY: and his reaction as Samia goes on:
SAMIA: . which should exclude you from any objective discussion. But keep in mind, even the arts aren't free of aggressive content, nor the institution of marriage.
CATHERINE: I think these cold, "objective" discussions are aggressive, She gets up and starts to move away.
SAMIA: But I'd like to say, so that I don't dampen the spirit of your You haven't dampened my spirit, Samia. Excuse me.
CATHERINE: ( cutting her off ) You haven't dampened my spirit, Samia. Excuse me.
SAMIA: Well, I should hope not.
RAYETTE: What kind of doggy is that?
CARL: It's a Borzoi.
RAYETTE: Oh, uh huh. I had a little kittycat once, that Bobby give me.
SAMIA: There. You see what I mean?
RAYETTE: Well, she was.
SAMIA: She addresses Fincher gesturing toward Rayette
BOBBY: Don't sit there pointing at her.
SAMIA: I beg your pardon.
BOBBY: ( advancing on her ) I said, don't point at her like that! What gives you the right to sit there and tell anybody about class and who the hell's got it, and what she typifies! You shouldn't even be in the same room with her, you creep!
SAMIA: Carl, this is really too much.
BOBBY: ( to Samia ) You're totally full of shit!
CARL: Robert, I think you better just.
BOBBY: ( cutting him off ) You're all full of shit!
RAYETTE: ( moving past her ) I can't talk to you right now, leave me alone.

SPICER: Hey, this is my room.
BOBBY: ( moving over to the bed ) What's going on here!?
TITA: It's none of your business!
BOBBY: Where's Catherine?!
TITA: I don't know where she is!
SPICER: Don't you believe in knocking, pal?
BOBBY: I'm talking to you, Tita!
TITA: ( close to tears ) Can't I have anything to myself, ( grabbing hold of him again ) Come on now, out!
SPICER: ( grabbing hold of him again ) Come on now, out!
BOBBY: ( struggling with him ) Keep your fucking hands off my sister, nurse!
SPICER: Did you hear me! Move out!!
TITA: Stop it! Bobby, will just you stop! I mean it!
SPICER: Hold it, just hold it!!
TITA: Carl! Somebody get Carl!
SPICER: Take it easy, dammit!
TITA: Stop it! Right now! Just stop it!! And as she runs from the room, Spicer begins violently jerking his forearm up against Bobby's trachea, punctuating each jerk with the repeated Give up! Give up! Give up! Give up! Give up! Give up!
SPICER: Give up! Give up! Give up! Give up! Give up! Give up!
TITA: Oh God, Bobby, look what you've He looks past her, to Catherine.
BOBBY: I just wanted to talk to you for a EXT. BAYFRONT - DAY Catherine and Bobby sit on a low stone wall bordering the Dupea property. Each is staring out at the ocean, and after a moment:
CATHERINE: No. It's useless, Robert. It wouldn't work, not ever.
BOBBY: Just give me a chance, will you?
CATHERINE: I'm trying to be delicate with you, but you're not understanding me. It's not just because of Carl, or my music, but because of you. I mean, what would it come to? If a person has no love for himself, no respect, no love for his work, his family, his friends, something. How can he ask for love in return? I mean, why should he ask for it?
BOBBY: And living out here, in this rest home asylum, that's what you want?
CATHERINE: ( looking back to her ) That'll make you happy.
BOBBY: ( looking back to her ) That'll make you happy.
CATHERINE: I hope it will, yes. I'm sorry.
BOBBY: EXT. COUNTRY - DAY Bobby pushes Nicholas's wheelchair along a path between fields of tall grasses and wildflowers. He stops and moves around to the front of the chair.
