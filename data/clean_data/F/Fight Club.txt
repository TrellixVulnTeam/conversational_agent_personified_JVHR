MARLA: Should we?
JACK: In case we want to switch nights.
MARLA: I suppose.

ATTENDANT: Check-in for that flight doesn't begin for another two hours, Sir.
MAIN ROOM: Jack sits on the bed. He turns on the TV. It's tuned to the "Sheraton Channel," shows WAITERS serving people in a large BANQUET ROOM. Jack stops brushing his teeth, feels something on the bed, lifts it a small DINNER MINT.
TECHNICIAN #1: Here's where the infant went through the windshield. Three points.
TECHNICIAN #2: The teenager's braces around the backseat ashtray would make a good "anti-smoking" ad.
TECHNICIAN #1: The father must've been huge. See how the fat burnt into the driver's seat with his polyester shirt? Very "modern art."
JACK: If X is less than the cost of a recall, we don't do one.
BUSISNESS WOMAN: Are there a lot of these kinds of Oh, you wouldn't believe.

JACK: Pardon me?
TYLER: Tyler Durden.
TYLER: You know why they have oxygen masks on planes?
JACK: No, supply oxygen?
TYLER: Oxygen gets you high. In a catastrophic emergency, we're taking giant, panicked breaths.
TYLER: Suddenly, we become euphoic and docile. We accept our fate.
TYLER: Emergency water landing, 600 miles per hour. Blank faces calm as Hindu cows.
JACK: What do you do, Tyler?
TYLER: What do you want me to do?
JACK: I mean for a living.
TYLER: Why? So you can say, "Oh, that's what you do." And be a smug little shit about it?
TYLER: You have a kind of sick desperation in your laugh.
JACK: We have the same briefcase.
TYLER: Open it.
TYLER: Soap the yardstick of civilization. I make and sell soap.
TYLER: If you were to add nitric acid to the soap-making process, one would get nitroglycerin. With enough soap, one could blow up the world, if one were so inclined.
JACK: Tyler, you are by far the most interesting "single-serving" friend I've ever met.
JACK: You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained
TYLER: The spork. I get it. You're very Thank you.

TYLER: . As I squeeze past, do I give you the ass or the crotch?
TYLER: We are defined by the choices we make.
SECURITY TFM: ( to Jack ) Throwers don't worry about ticking. Modern bombs don't tick.
JACK: Excuse me? "Throwers?"
SECURITY TFM: Baggage handlers. But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
JACK: My suitcase was vibrating?
SECURITY TFM: Nine time out of ten, it's an electric razor. But, every once in a while . .it's a dildo. It's airline policy not to imply ownership in the event of a dildo. We use the indefinite aricle: "A dildo." Never "Your
JACK: ( to Security TFM ) I had everything in that bag. My C.K. shirts. my D.K.N.Y. shoes.
SECURITY TFM: ( into phone ) Yeah, uh huh. yeah? ( pause, still on phone )
SECURITY TFM: I'm terribly sorry.
SECURITY TFM: You know the industry slang for "Flight Attendant?" "Air Mattress."
DOORMAN: There's nothing up there.
DOORMAN: You can't go into the unit. Police
DOORMAN: Do you have somebody you can call?
DOORMAN: Lots of young people try to impress the world and buy too many things.
DOORMAN: Many young people feel trapped and Then, the refrigerator's compressor could have clicked on.
DOORMAN: If you don't know what you want, you end up with a lot you don't.

TYLER'S VOICE: Who's this?

TYLER'S VOICE: Oh, yeah.

TYLER'S VOICE: I star-sixty-nined you. I never pick up my phone. What's up?
JACK: Well. let me see. here's the
JACK: You buy furniture. You tell yourself: this is the last sofa I'll ever need. No matter what else happens, I've got the sofa issue handled. Then, the right set of dishes. The right dinette.
TYLER: This is how we fill up our lives.
JACK: I guess so.
TYLER: And, now it's gone.
JACK: All gone.
TYLER: Could be worse. A woman could cut off your penis while you're asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car.
JACK: There's always that.
TYLER: I don't know, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
JACK: .no .no .
TYLER: I mean, you did lose a lot of nice, neat little shit. The trendy paper lamps, the Euro-trash shelving unit, am I right?
TYLER: But maybe, just maybe, you've been Delivered from Swedish furniture.
JACK: ( toasts ) Delivered from Swedish furniture.
TYLER: Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
JACK: Delivered from Martha Stewart.
TYLER: Delivered from bullshit colors like "Cobalt," "Ebony," and "Fuchsia."
JACK: Insurance'll cover it.
TYLER: Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the What list?
JACK: What list?
TYLER: The "now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list. That list.
JACK: I don't. think so.
TYLER: This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
JACK: Well, I have to file a claim.
TYLER: The things you own, they end up owning you.
JACK: Don't I?
TYLER: Do what you like.

TYLER: A hotel?
JACK: So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you. go find a hotel?
TYLER: So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you. go find a hotel?
JACK: I don't follow.
TYLER: We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
JACK: You called me so you could have a place to stay.
TYLER: You called me so you could have a place to stay.
JACK: No, I.
TYLER: Why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
JACK: Would that be a problem?
TYLER: Is it a problem for you to ask?
JACK: Can I stay at your place?
TYLER: Yes, you can.
JACK: Thank you.
TYLER: You're welcome. But, I want you to do me one favor.
JACK: What's that?
TYLER: I want you to hit me as hard as you I want you to hit me as hard as you
JACK: I want you to hit me as hard as you
TYLER: I want you to hit me as hard as you
JACK: Tyler was a night person. He sometimes worked as a projectionist. A movie doesn't come in one big reel, it's on a few. In old theaters, two projectors are used, so someone has to change projectors at the exact second when one reel ends and another reel begins. Sometimes you can see two dots on screen in the upper right hand corner.
TYLER: They're called "cigarette burns."
JACK: It's called a "changeover." The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea.
TYLER: Why would anyone want this shitty job?
JACK: It affords him other interesting adult movies into family films.
TYLER: Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.
JACK: In reel three, right after the courageous dog and the snooty cag who have celebrity voices eat out of a garbage can, there's the flash of Tyler's contribution.
TYLER: One-forty-eighth of a second. That's how long it's up there.
JACK: No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
TYLER: A nice, big cock.
JACK: Only a hummingbird could have caught Tyler at work.
JACK: Tyler also worked as a banquet waiter at the luxurious Pressman Hotel.
JACK: He was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry.
TYLER: Don't watch. I can't if you watch.
TYLER: . Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
JACK: He farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised endive; and, with creme of mushroom soup, well.
JACK: You get the idea.
JACK: I don't know about this.
TYLER: I don't know, either. I want to find out. I've never been hit, have you?
JACK: No. That's a good thing, isn't it?
TYLER: I don't want to die without any scars. How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight? Come on. you're the only person I've ever asked.
JACK: Jack stares at him.
TYLER: Why not you? I'm letting you go first. Do it.
JACK: This is crazy.
TYLER: Alright, go crazy. Let 'er rip.
JACK: Where do you want it? In the face?
TYLER: Surprise me.
JACK: Shit. Sorry. That didn't count.
TYLER: Like hell. That counted.
TYLER: How do you feel?
JACK: But a good strange.
TYLER: But a good strange.
JACK: Is it?
TYLER: We've crossed the threshold. You want to call it off?
JACK: Call what off?
TYLER: The fight.
JACK: What fight?
TYLER: This fight, pussy.
TYLER: If you could fight anyone. one on one, whoever you wanted, who would you fight?
JACK: Jack thinks.
TYLER: Jack thinks.
JACK: My boss, probably. Who would you fight?
TYLER: My dad. No question.
JACK: Oh, yeah. I didn't know my dad. Well, I knew him, till I was six. He went and married another woman, had more kids. Every six years or so he'd do it again new city, new family.
TYLER: He was setting up franchises. My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go.
JACK: I know that.
TYLER: After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, "Now what?" He said, "Get a job." When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, "Now what?" He said, "I don't know. Get married."
JACK: Same here.
TYLER: A generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is the answer we really need.
JACK: We should do this again sometime.
JACK: Where's your car?
TYLER: What car?
TYLER: ( of magazine ) Oh, a new riot control grenade. ( reading ) ".the successful combination of concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash- blasts and simultaneous high-velocity disbursement of.blah, blah, blah."
JACK: Oh, a new riot control grenade. ".the successful combination of concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash- blasts and simultaneous high-velocity disbursement of.blah, blah, blah."
TYLER: Oh, a new riot control grenade. ".the successful combination of concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash- blasts and simultaneous high-velocity disbursement of.blah, blah, blah."
JACK: ( "Reader's Digest" ) "I am Joe's Lungs." It's written in first person. "Without me, Joe could not take in oxygen to feed his red blood cells." There's a whole series "I am Joe's Prostate."
TYLER: "I get cancer, and I kill Joe."
JACK: What are you reading?

BOSS: Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?
WALTER: Walter continues, his sales pitch drowned out by Jack's V.O.:
WALTER: I showed this already to my man here. You liked it, didn't you?
WALTER: Jesus, I'd hate to see what happened to the other guy.
IRVINE: Drink up people. We're closing.
TYLER: Welcome to fight club.
TYLER: The first rule of fight club is you don't talk about fight club. The second rule of fight club is you don't talk about fight club. The third rule of fight club is when someone says "stop" or goes limp, the fight is over. Fourth rule is only two guys to a fight. Fifth rule one fight at a time. Sixth rule no shirts, no shoes. Seventh rule fights go on as long as they have to. And the eighth and final rule if this is your first night at fight club, you have to fight.
GOATEED MAN: ( spittle-lipped ) Ssssstop. !
BOSS: What are you getting yourself into every week?
BOSS: Have you finished those reports?
JACK: ( handing him reports ) The people who had power over you have less and less.
JACK: If you could fight any celebrity?
TYLER: Alive or dead?
JACK: Doesn't matter.
TYLER: Hemingway. You?
JACK: Shatner. William Shatner.
TYLER: Self-improvement is masturbation. Self-destruction is the answer.
JACK: ( to Tyler, so the You could take him.
TYLER: The trick is not to care.
JACK: . stop.
TYLER: Jack limply shakes his Opponent's hand.
OPPONENT: How about next week?
JACK: Look at me. How about next month?
TYLER: He fell down some stairs.
JACK: I fell down some stairs.
TYLER: Any historical figure.
JACK: Okay. Ghandi.
TYLER: Good answer.
JACK: Abe Lincoln. Big reach. Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
TYLER: Abe Lincoln. Big reach. Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
TYLER: Remember, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart.
JACK: INTERCUT WITH. INT. MARLA'S BUILDING, HALLWAY - SAME Marla's in the HALL, on the PAYPHONE, twisting the phone cord around her neck.
MARLA: Where have you been the last few
JACK: Jack looks through the archway and sees Tyler, in his gummy flannel bathrobe, doing sit-ups. Jack leans, cups the phone.
JACK: ( quietly ) How did you find me?
MARLA: The forwarding number. I haven't seen you at any support groups.
JACK: That's the idea we split them.
MARLA: You haven't been going to yours.
JACK: I found a new one.
MARLA: It's for men.
JACK: It's for men.
MARLA: Like testicular cancer?
JACK: Look, this is a bad time.
MARLA: I've been going to debtor's anonymous. You want to see some truly fucked up people?
JACK: I'm just on my way out.
MARLA: Me too. I got a stomach full of Xanax. I took what was left of a bottle. Might've been too much.
MARLA: This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
JACK: So you're staying in tonight?
MARLA: Do you want to wait to hear me describe death?
MARLA'S VOICE: Do you want to listen and see if my spirit can use the telephone?
JACK: You're not going to believe what I dreamt last night.
MARLA: I can hardly believe anything about last night.
JACK: What are you doing here?
MARLA: What. ?
JACK: What the hell are you doing here?
MARLA: Fuck you.
TYLER: She's a piece of work. Get this I come in here last night, the phone's off the hook.
MARLA'S VOICE: ( from handset ) I'll tell you when I'm floating out of my body.
MARLA: You got here fast.
MARLA: The mattresses are all sealed in slippery plastic.
MARLA: Did I call you?
MARLA: Don't worry. It's not a threat to you.
MARLA: Oh, no! Somebody called the cops.
COP: 8-G! Where's 8-G?
MARLA: ( pointing ) End of the hall.
MARLA: ( calling after ) The girl who lives there used to be a charming, lovely girl, but she's lost faith in herself.
COP: Miss Singer, let us help you! You have every reason to live!
MARLA: She's a monster! Infectious human waste! Good luck trying to save her!
MARLA: If I fall asleep, I'm done for. You're gonna have to keep me up all
TYLER: Unbelievable, huh?
TYLER: I mean, this girl. uh, you're not into her or anything. ?
JACK: No. Not at all.
TYLER: You're sure?
JACK: Yeah, I'm sure.
TYLER: Good. This chick was up on the table with her legs in the stirrups before the doctor even walked in the room. The things that she said. I've never heard a woman talk like that.
MARLA: ( whispering ) I want to have your abortion.
TYLER: You're okay with this?
JACK: I'm fine.
TYLER: She is a wild, twisted bitch. Stay away from that one.
JACK: Oh, and my pace is more librarians.
TYLER: Hey. don't knock librarians.
JACK: Marla doesn't need a lover. She needs a case worker.
TYLER: She needs an exorcist. This isn't love. This is sport-fucking.
TYLER: Listen. do me a favor. sit here a minute.
JACK: You've gotta understand something about me. I have a little rule, okay? Don't ever talk to her about me. Ever. I can't stand that kind of shit.
TYLER: You've gotta understand something about me. I have a little rule, okay? Don't ever talk to her about me. Ever. I can't stand that kind of shit.
TYLER: If you ever say anything about me or about what happens here in this house, to her or anyone I will find out. And you'll never see me again. Promise me.
JACK: Promise you won't.
TYLER: Promise you won't.
JACK: Yes, I promise.
TYLER: I said I promise!
JACK: I said I promise!
TYLER: That was three times you promised.
MARLA'S VOICE: ( muffled through wall ) Miserable fucking discharge!
TYLER: What are you doing?
JACK: I. uh. just going to bed.
TYLER: You want to finish her off?
JACK: Uh. nah.
BOSS: Is that your blood?
JACK: Some of it, yes.
BOSS: Take the rest of the day off. Come back tomorrow with clean clothes. Get yourself together.
TYLER'S VOICE: ( laughing ) You fucking slut!!
MARLA'S VOICE: Thank you, sir, may I have another! Thank you sir, may I have another. !

DETECTIVE STERN: Does this sound strange to you?
JACK: Yes, sire, strange. Very strange.
DETECTIVE STERN: The dynamite.
JACK: DETECTIVE STERN
DETECTIVE STERN: Yes. It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means?
JACK: What does that mean?
DETECTIVE STERN: It means it was homemade.
JACK: This is. really a shock.
DETECTIVE STERN: Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion. The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
JACK: Who do you think could've done this?
DETECTIVE STERN: I'll ask the questions, son.
TYLER: ( whispering in Jack's ear ) Tell him.
JACK: ( overlap w/below ) "The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception."
TYLER: ( overlap w/below ) "The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception."
JACK: ( into phone, I don't know what to make of this, sir, I really don't.
DETECTIVE STERN: Do you know anyone who'd have the expertise or motive to do something like this?
TYLER: "I reject the basic assumptions of civilization, including material
JACK: ( into phone ) No. No, sir. I loved that condo. I loved every stick of furniture. The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were me. The dishes were me. The plants I'd like to thank the academy.
DETECTIVE STERN: Well, if any ideas come to you, give me a call. In the meantime, don't leave town. I may need to bring you in for questioning.
END INTERCUT: Jack hangs up. Tyler shrugs.
TYLER: Could be worse. You could be cursed with the three terrible Karmas. You could be beautiful, rich and famous.
MARLA: I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
JACK: ( keeps scrubbing ) Worth every penny.
MARLA: ( seductive ) It's a bridesmaid's dress. Someone loved it intensely for one day, then tossed it. Like a Christmas tree so special, then, bam it's abandoned on the side of the road, tinsel still clinging to it.
MARLA: Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical It suits you.
JACK: ( coldly ) It suits you.
MARLA: You can borrow it sometime.

JACK: I, uh. think you should go now.
JACK: It's time for you to leave.
MARLA: Don't worry, I'm leaving.
MARLA: You're such a nutcase, I can't even begin to keep up.
JACK: She laughs, spins on her heels. As she exits the back door, she sings "This Merry-Go-Round" from "Valley of the Dolls." Jack watches her through the kitchen window.

TYLER: A liposuction clinic.
TYLER: Paydirt. From society's richest asses and thighs.
TYLER: As the fat renders, the tallow floats to the surface. Remember the crap they taught you in Boy Scouts.
JACK: Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts.
TYLER: This clear layer in glycerin. We'll mix it back in when we make the soap.
TYLER: Lye the crucial ingredient. Ancient peoples found their clothes got cleaner if they washed them at a certain spot in the river. Why? Because, human sacrifices were once made on the hills above this river. Year after year, bodies burnt. Rain feel. Water seeped through the wood ashes to become lye. The lye combined with the melted fat of the bodies, till a thick white soapy discharge crept into the river.
TYLER: The first soap was made from the ashes of heroes. Like the first monkeys shot into space.
TYLER: Without sacrifice, without death, we would have nothing.
TYLER: This is a chemical burn. It will hurt more than you've ever been burned and you will have a scar.
TYLER: Look at your hand.
TYLER: Come back to the pain. Don't shut this out.
TYLER: Stop it. This is your pain your burning hand. It's right here. Look at it.
TYLER: Don't deal with this the way those dead people do. Deal with it the way a living person does.
JACK: I. I think I understand. I think I get it.
TYLER: No, what you're feeling is premature
TYLER: This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it.
JACK: No, I'm not.
TYLER: Shut up. Our fathers were our models for God. And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
JACK: I don't know.
TYLER: Listen to me. You have to consider the possibility that God doesn't like you, he never wanted you. In all probability, He hates you. This is not the worst thing that can happen.
JACK: It isn't. ?
TYLER: We don't need him.
JACK: We don't. ?
JACK: . Marla . ?
TYLER: Fuck damnation. Fuck redemption. We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it.
TYLER: You can go to the sink and run water over your hand. Look at me. Or you can use vinegar to neutralize the burn, but first you have to give up. First, you have to know that someday, you are going to die. Until you know that, you will be useless.
JACK: You . you don't know what this feels like, Tyler.
TYLER: Congratulations. You're a step closer to hitting bottom.
BOSS: "The first rule of fight club is you don't talk about fight club."
BOSS: "The second rule of fight club. Is this yours?

JACK: "Abuse" the copy machine. There's an Pretend you're me. You find this. What would you do?
BOSS: Pretend you're me. You find this. What would you do?
JACK: Me? I'd be very careful who I talked to about this. It sounds like someone dangerous wrote it. someone who might snap at any moment, stalking from office to office with an Armalite AR-10 Carbine-gas semiautomatic, bitterly pumping round after round into colleagues and co-
JACK: Might be someone you've known for years. somebody very close to you. Or, maybe you shouldn't be bringing me every little piece of trash you pick up.
JACK: Compliance and Liability.
MARLA'S VOICE: My tit's going to rot off.
JACK: Just a second. Could you excuse me? I need to take this call.
JACK: ( into phone ) What are you talking about?
MARLA: Would you do something for me? I need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast. I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor.
JACK: I don't know .

MARLA: What happened to your hand?
JACK: INT. MARLA'S ROOM - NIGHT Marla stands facing a MIRROR with her shirt open. Jack stands behind her with his hand on the bottom side of her breast. Marla's hand guides his.
JACK: Where? Here?
MARLA: Feel anything?
JACK: Feel anything?
MARLA: Feel anything?
JACK: Feel anything?
MARLA: Feel anything?
JACK: Jack's head is behind Marla's. They speak softer, slower.
MARLA: Make sure.
JACK: Okay. Okay, I'm sure.
MARLA: You feel nothing?
JACK: Marla turns around and faces him, begins to button her shirt.
MARLA: Well, that's a relief. Thank you.
JACK: No. no problem.
MARLA: I wish I could return the favor.
JACK: I think everything's okay here.
MARLA: I could check your prostate.
JACK: Uh . nah.

BOB: Better than I've ever been in my life.
JACK: Really? Great. Still "Remaining Men
BOB: No. I found something new.
JACK: Really, what's that?
BOB: ( quietly ) The first rule is. you aren't supposed to talk about it.
JACK: And the second rule about it is. you're not supposed to talk about it. And the third rule.
BOB: And the second rule about it is. you're not supposed to talk about it. And the third rule.

JACK: Yeah, both of us.
BOB: You know about the guy who invented it? I hear all kinds of things. Supposedly, he was born in a mental institution. They say he only sleeps one hour a night. You know about this guy? Tyler Durden?
BOB: Thank you. Thank you.
JACK: You're welcome.
TYLER: No thanks, I quit.
JACK: You quit?
TYLER: Yeah. Where you headed?
JACK: Work. Going to work.
JACK: What. ?
TYLER: Nothing. Do what you like.
JACK: We need to talk.
BOSS: Okay. Where to begin? With your constant absenteeism? With your unpresentable appearance? You're up for review.
JACK: I Am Jack's Complete Lack of Surprise.
JACK: Let's pretend. You're the Department of Transportation, and you discover that our company intentionally did nothing about leather seats cured in third world countries with chemicals we know cause birth defects? Brake linings that fail after a thousand miles. Fuel injectors that burn people alive.
BOSS: Just who the fuck do you think you are?! Get out! You're fired!
JACK: What about this? Keep me on payroll as an outside consultant. In exchange for my salary, I'll keep my mouth shut. I won't need to come to the office. I can do this job from

JACK: I am now officially self-employed.
TYLER: Good for you.
TYLER: I look around. I look around and see a lot of new faces.
TYLER: Shut up! Which means a lot of you have been breaking the first two rules of fight club.
TYLER: I see in fight club the strongest and smartest men who have ever lived an entire generation pumping gas and waiting tables; or they're slaves with white collars. Advertisements have them chasing cars and clothes, working jobs they hate so they can buy shit they don't need. We are the middle children of history, with no purpose or place. We have no great war, or great depression. The great war is a spiritual war. The great depression is our lives. We were raised by television to believe that we'd be millionaires and movie gods and rock stars but we won't. And we're learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed-off.
TYLER: We are the quiet young men who listen until it's time to decide.
TYLER: Who are you?
TYLER: Tyler Durden.
LOU: Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
TYLER: We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
LOU: Irvine? Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.
LOU: He don't own this place, I do. How much money's he getting for this?
TYLER: There is no money.
LOU: It's free to all.
TYLER: It's free to all.
LOU: Ain't that something?
TYLER: Yes, it is.
LOU: Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone outta here now!
TYLER: You're welcome to join our club.
LOU: Did you hear what I just said?!
TYLER: You and your friend.
LOU: You hear me now?
TYLER: No, I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
TYLER: We really need to use this place.
TYLER: That's it.. that's good. Get it all out. You'll feel better.
TYLER: Yes, I am shit and crazy, to you and this whole fucking world.
TYLER: You don't know where I've been.
TYLER: We need this place. We need it. Please let us keep it, please.
LOU: What are you doing?!
TYLER: Okay! Okay, fuck it! Use the basement! Get off me!
LOU: Okay! Okay, fuck it! Use the basement! Get off me!
TYLER: We need some towels, Lou. We need replacement light bulbs.

SECOND MAN: Watch out, jackass!
SEMINARIAN: You. you did that on purpose!

TYLER: Human Sacrifice.

TYLER: They give basement apartments letters instead of numbers. Raymond, you're going to die.
TYLER: Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?
RAYMOND: Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.

RAYMOND: Tyler UNCOCKS the gun, lowers it.

TYLER: I'm keeping your license. I know where you live. I'm going to check on you. If you aren't back in school and on your way to being a veterinarian in six weeks, you will be dead. Get the hell out of here.
JACK: I feel sick.
TYLER: Imagine how he feels.
JACK: I don't care, that was horrible.
TYLER: Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day of Raymond K. Hessell's life.
TYLER: His breakfast will taste better than any meal he has ever eaten.
TYLER: ( muttering quietly ) . You are not how much money you have in the bank. You are not the shoes you wear.

BOB: The first rule of Project Mayhem is. you do not ask questions.
TYLER: Wrap it around the top of his hackie- Man, his balls are ice cold.
BOB: Man, his balls are ice cold.
TYLER: You're not going to continue your "rigorous investigation." You will publicly state that there is no underground group. Or imagine, the rest of your life with your scrotum flapping empty.
JACOBS: ( mouth taped ) . no. please, no.
TYLER: We'll send one to the New York Times and one to the Los Angeles Times. Press release style. Your nuts will be bicoastal. Understood? The people you're after are everyone you depend on. We do your laundry, cook your food and serve you dinner. We guard you while you sleep. We drive your ambulances. Do not fuck with us.
TYLER: Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?
JACK: I felt like destroying something
VALET: There you are, Mr. Durden. Airport parking, long term.
JACK: ( motions to car ) After you, Mr. Durden.
TYLER: No. after you.
TYLER: Something on your mind?
JACK: Tyler shrugs; turns on the RADIO, ignores Jack.
JACK: Why wasn't I told about "Project What should I have told you?
TYLER: What should I have told you?
JACK: Why wasn't I involved from the beginning? You and I started fight club together.
TYLER: Fight club was the beginning. Now it's out of the basements and there's a name for it Project Mayhem.
JACK: This is as much mine as yours.
TYLER: Is this a needlepoint club? Is it about you and me?
JACK: You know what I mean.
TYLER: What do you want? A statement of purpose. ?
JACK: Should I E-mail you? Should I put this on your "action item list?"

TYLER: This does not belong to us. We are not the leaders. We are not special.
JACK: What are you doing?!
TYLER: We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world. We are all part of the same compost heap.
JACK: Tyler steers back into the proper lane. The other CAR flies past, HORN SOUNDING.
JACK: What the hell . ?!
TYLER: You choose your level of involvement. I won't make decisions for you.
JACK: I'm not asking you to.
TYLER: You're asking questions that don't have answers. You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else.
JACK: I don't think that's true.
JACK: Tyler. what is this. !

RICKY: Paint a self-portrait.
MECHANIC: Build a house.
TYLER: ( to Jack ) And you?
JACK: I don't know! Nothing!
TYLER: If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
JACK: I would feel nothing about my life? Is that what you want to hear?!
TYLER: I want to hear the truth.
JACK: Fuck my life. Fuck fight club. Fuck you and fuck Marla. I'm sick of this. How's that?
TYLER: Why do you think I blew up your condo?
JACK: Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat! It's not a seminar! You have to forget everything you know, everything you think you know about life, about friendship, about you and me.
TYLER: Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat! It's not a seminar! You have to forget everything you know, everything you think you know about life, about friendship, about you and me.
JACK: Okay, okay. fine.
TYLER: We just had a near-life experience.
TYLER: In the world I see you're stalking elk through the damp canyon forests around the ruins of Rockefeller Center. You will wear leather clothes that last you the rest of your life. You will climb the wrist- thick kudzu vines that wrap the Sears Tower. You will see tiny figures pounding corn and laying-strips of venison on the empty car pool lane of the ruins of a superhighway.
TYLER: ( leaving ) Feel better, champ.
MARLA: I'll be out of your way in a sec.
JACK: You. don't have to. leave.

JACK: A little more faith than that.
MARLA: I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
JACK: Give me a minute, Marla, alright. just sixty seconds.
MARLA: Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
JACK: Absolutely, you have every right. I need you to do me a favor.
MARLA: I've done you enough favors.

JACK: I'm trying to tell you and this is where you have to trust me but, I think your life might be in real You have to get out of here. Leave as soon as possible. Go to any rural town, away from any major city.

JACK: Yes, fine. Just, get on. Stay away a couple of weeks, at least.
MARLA: Jack finally looks to her.
MARLA: You are the worst thing that ever happened to me.
JACK: Son of a bitch!
JACK: ( loudly ) I want you to arrest me. I'm the leader of a terrorist organization responsible for acts of vandalism all over the city. Detective Stern in arson knows who I am.
JACK: There are probably several hundred members in the metropolitan area. Chapters are sprouting in at least five other major cities. They're tightly-regimented, with many cells capable of operating without a central leader. Check this address: 1537 Paper Street. You'll find the body of Robert Paulson buried in the garden. You'll also find numerous tubs used to make gallons of nitroglycerin. The plan, I believe, is to blow up these credit card headquarters and the TRW building.
STERN: Why these buildings?
JACK: You are not your job. You are not how much money you have in the bank.
STERN: ( to other detectives ) Keep him talking.
JACK: REDHEAD DETECTIVE
REDHEAD DETECTIVE: You're a genius, sir.
BALD DETECTIVE: You know the drill. You said if anyone ever tries to interfere with Project Mayhem, even you, we got to get his balls.
REDHEAD: This is really a powerful gesture, Mr. Durden. It'll set quite an No. you're making a mistake!
JACK: No. you're making a mistake!
JACK: I'm not Tyler Durden!
BALDY: You told us you'd say that, too.
JACK: Okay, I am Tyler Durden and I'm ordering you to abort the mission!
BALDY: What's our best time for a "cut and Four minutes.
BALDY: Is somebody timing this?
REDHEAD: ( looks at his watch ) Wait till the second hand gets to the
STERN: Some of this info checks out. Let's go to the place on Paper Street.
REDHEAD: ( checking his watch ) Mr. Durden, you're going to fuck up the time!
TYLER: Could be worse.
TYLER: You could be standing under 37 stories of steel and concrete with a 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped to the support. oh, maybe it couldn't be.
JACK: ( points at bomb ) You. you can't be serious about What a ridiculous thing to say.
TYLER: What a ridiculous thing to say.
JACK: I can't let you.
TYLER: .go through with this?
JACK: I'm going to.
TYLER: .stop me?
JACK: I'm not going.
TYLER: .to let this happen!
JACK: Stop finishing.
TYLER: .your sentences! They're our sentences. Get your mind around
TYLER: What are you doing running through the streets in your underpants? We both use that body.
JACK: Since when is Project Mayhem about The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago. Everything's proceeding exactly as planned.
TYLER: The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago. Everything's proceeding exactly as planned.
JACK: You don't know that. There could still be people inside.
TYLER: Maybe. Maybe a couple of guys with shaved heads couldn't synchronize their watches. Good riddance.
TYLER: I wouldn't be doing that. Unless you know which wires, in what order.
JACK: If you know, I know.
TYLER: Or. maybe I knew you'd know, so I spent the whole day thinking about the wrong ones.
JACK: If I'm wrong, we're both dead..
TYLER: This is not about martyrdom.
JACK: I'm pulling the green wire.
TYLER: Green? Did you say green?
JACK: Don't pull the green wire. Pull anything but the green wire.
TYLER: Don't pull the green wire. Pull anything but the green wire.
JACK: Fuck you.
TYLER: I'm serious. That's the wrong one.
TYLER: Hear that? Marla's here. Just in the nick of time, eh?
TYLER: See for yourself.
MARLA: You motherfuckers.
TYLER: I've got everything. The bombs. The army. I've got Marla.
JACK: Bob is dead, Tyler. The police blew a hole in his head. Was that part of your plan?
TYLER: Bob was a grown man. In any great struggle, there will be casualties. Wouldn't that be implicit in the name? Project "Mayhem."
JACK: Fuck your struggle. I want out.
TYLER: You want out?
JACK: I quit.
TYLER: Not an option, for the most obvious of reasons. You need to get with the Seven minutes. Let's get out of here.
JACK: ( still walking away ) ( COCKS the gun ) Defuse the bomb.
TYLER: ( still walking away ) ( COCKS the gun ) Defuse the bomb.
JACK: ( COCKS the gun ) Defuse the bomb.
TYLER: Ask me nicely.
JACK: Defuse the bomb, please.
TYLER: Defuse the bomb?
JACK: Tyler strides towards the BOMB. Jack trains the gun.
JACK: Tyler looks at the BOMB, reaches over to it. He grips the GREEN WIRE, yanks it out the CLOCK STOPS. Jack lowers his gun.
TYLER: I did that for you. As a gesture. Now, how fast can you run? There are ten other bombs, in ten other buildings in the immediate area. If you're going to get them all, you better get cracking. Six minutes. Green wires, remember. I'll be upstairs.
TYLER: Whoa! What was that all about?
TYLER: Fire at will.
TYLER: What did you expect?
TYLER: One minute.
TYLER: ( looking out window ) This is the beginning. We're at ground zero. Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
JACK: i. ann..iinn.. ff..nnyin.
JACK: ( still distorted ) I still can't think of anything.
TYLER: It's getting exciting now.
TYLER: Look what we've accomplished. Thirty seconds. Out these windows, we will view the economic collapse. One step closer to global equilibrium. I'm glad you're here with me.
JACK: ( distorted ) Can't you call it off. ?
TYLER: It's out of our hands. This is it.
JACK: Fifteen seconds now. Can you see alright? 10. 9. 8..
TYLER: Fifteen seconds now. Can you see alright? 10. 9. 8..
TYLER: 5. 4. 3. 2.
TYLER: What the fuck ?
JACK: ( relieved ) Paraffin. Your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin. I saw it floating in the bomb. They must've run out of cotton and Epsom salt. Paraffin is iffy at best.
TYLER: ( relieved ) Paraffin. Your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin. I saw it floating in the bomb. They must've run out of cotton and Epsom salt. Paraffin is iffy at best.
JACK: ( relieved ) Paraffin. Your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin. I saw it floating in the bomb. They must've run out of cotton and Epsom salt. Paraffin is iffy at best.

TYLER: You need me.
JACK: No, no, I don't. I thank you, I really do. Thank you, but I don't need you anymore.
TYLER: Look, I can be selfish, I know that. I'm not blind to my own failings.
