FRIGHT NIGHT: Written by Marti Noxon
TELEVISION ANNOUNCER: Peter Vincent's "FRIGHT NIGHT." The family DOG is up on the coffee table eating what's left of a fast food burger and fries, still in the box.
DISTANT VOICE: Get off her!! More voices yelling, something being thrown. An ugly domestic scene. We creep down a dark hall toward a cracked door, light seeps through the opening it SLAMS OPEN and ADAM, 17, crashes toward us. He's nice-looking, a little nerdy and he's in a blind We get a glimpse of the horrible scene behind the door. A teen girl's room the sound of flesh ripping. We see a pale arm on the ground, shaking violently, as if something is tearing and tugging at the body attached to it. We bolt away with ADAM, who we now see is blood splattered, as he races UPSTAIRS. A PHONE CRADLE is ripped out of the wall, which Adam nearly falls over.
ADAM: Come on, come on, come on. He gets it. But the GUN HAS A GUN LOCK. Adam has to dig in his dead father's pockets for his keys. Adam starts to cry.
HIM: Brutally strong, veins dark and visible under the skin. Human but not quite. Adam reacts in horror. He knows he's dead. HE's RIPPED OUT OF FRAME as we hear:
CHARLIE: ( to the bike/pissed ) You want me to take you apart, huh? Charlie's 17 and has the slightly awkward feel of someone who He's a wry, thoughtful kid who's enjoying but not quite trusting a sudden surge in popularity.
DORIS: Nothing doing, huh?
CHARLIE: The thing's got no ambition. ( re: trash cans ) Can I uh, give you a hand?
DORIS: I got it. Thanks. She walks away her sweatpants have the word "LUCKY" across the butt. He watches her go appreciatively. Doesn't notice his mom, JANE, struggling to pull their own cans to the curb.
JANE: Don't leer at the neighbors, kid. Jane, 40's, attractive and frazzled, wears a REAL ESTATE brokers blazer. Charlie wheels his bike back to the curb.
CHARLIE: She's the one who put a word on her butt. I'm just reading it. Jane eyes a LARGE DUMPSTER FULL OF CONCRETE that sits in front of their NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR'S YARD.
JANE: Is he ever going to move that You need to get over it, Mom.
CHARLIE: You need to get over it, Mom.
JANE: ( WATCH IT )
CHARLIE: School's great, actually.
JANE: Good. Hasn't dumped me yet. He says this like he's surprised. Jane nods. Getting it.
CHARLIE: Good. Hasn't dumped me yet. He says this like he's surprised. Jane nods. Getting it.
JANE: That'll teach you to get so tall and handsome.
CHARLIE: Are you reading those books again? The Power of Whatever the Hell? She laughs. He glances at the DUMPSTER.
JANE: It's an eyesore. I'm trying to convince people to move in, not join the legions leaving town
CHARLIE: If you say "mortgage crisis" again I'm getting a new mom.
JANE: The guy moves in and puts a giant trash can in his yard! When the Perry's lived there Charlie has heard this before. It's a common refrain.
CHARLIE: The Perry's were the greatest neighbors ever. But they moved. I thought you were happy their place finally sold.
JANE: ( back on the neighbor ) He's not digging a pool. Where do you think all that concrete's coming from?
CHARLIE: You're spying on the guy now?
JANE: He's thirteen feet from our house. That's not spying, that's A BEETLE CONVERTIBLE pulls up. AMY drives and her two hot friends, CARA and BEE, sit in the back.
AMY: Hi, Mrs. Brewster.
JANE: Hi honey. Hi girls. ANY, 16, is a stunner. And she's as cool as she is beautiful the girl every other guy in school would die to be with.
CHARLIE: I'm tired of making excuses, Charlie. If you don't want to talk to him, would you please tell him?
JANE: I'm tired of making excuses, Charlie. If you don't want to talk to him, would you please tell him?
CHARLIE: Kinda defeats the purpose. He gets to AMY and the girls. Amy glances at the dirt bike.
AMY: Still can't get the bike started, Wow. No faith.
CHARLIE: Wow. No faith.
AMY: So you don't need a ride. Amy calls his bluff and starts to drive off. Charlie grabs his backpack and RACES after her.
CHARLIE: No, hey, stop She laughs, stops the car. Charlie tries to jump in and she drives again.
ON JANE: Watching them drive off, gone in a cloud of teen spirit.
BEE: Takes a man to wear purple, Chuck.
AMY: Chuck likes it when I call him Chuck, right Chuck?
BEE: Chuck likes it when I call him Chuck, right Chuck?
CHARLIE: It's they're not that's,
CARA: Can you stop someplace? I'm severely under-caffeinated.
AMY: ( ignores her/to Bee ) Did you see the poster for the formal? The theme is "Hope"?
BEE: I know. They asked me to be on the committee again but I was like hope is completely 2008. Grow up.
CHARLIE: Did you suggest "Despair?" Nobody would see that coming. Or global warming? Everybody has to wear tin foil.
AMY: ( laughs/to Charlie ) Did you go last year? We basically did the whole thing, Bee and me.
CHARLIE: ( LIES )
BEE: ( cutting him off ) Chuck was still under his rock. We're so glad you crawled out.
CARA: Caffeine!? Hello!
CHARLIE: I have Econ first period. Amy takes her hand off his leg. Charlie notices.
CARA: ( KILLING HIM )
CHARLIE: ( KILLING HIM )
CARA: Thank you, Jesus. Amy catches Charlie looking at his watch, fidgeting.
AMY: You're not going to flunk for missing Econ, Brain.
CHARLIE: Brain? I what? No, I'm But she's already walking away.
AMY: Five minutes. He watches her move off, anxious and smitten.
AMY: On time. You stress too much.
CHARLIE: I wasn't worried.
AMY: You were doing your worried thing.
CHARLIE: I was? I have a what's my
BEE: Doods. Looking massive.
MARK: ( to Charlie/re: drink ) Seriously? A Mochachino? You can't ride with the girls anymore. You let them brush your hair, My Pretty Pony? Mark grabs the cup away from him. Starts drinking it.
BEE: ( takes his arm ) Chuck's secure, aren't you? We see that Ben is also wearing PUMA's. Different design. It's a thing. Charlie shows his off he's secure.
CHARLIE: Fuck yeah.
BEN: Fuck yeah.
AMY: ( TO CHARLIE )
CHARLIE: Yeah. Hey. Come here. ( pulls her aside/awkward ) You know, the formal. Don't think I wasn't going to ask you, because I thought it was an obvious go. Together. Hope, puppies, kittens, the whole deal. You and me.
AMY: ( NOT UNKIND )
CHARLIE: Right. I knew that. MARK and BEN enjoy the view as the girls move off. Wow. Mark, incredulous, says to Charlie:
MARK: Did you find a frickin' Genie lamp man? Make a sacrifice to the hot ass Gods? How do you get that?
CHARLIE: Game, my friend. Rock solid. Charlie moves off. And even though he's playing it off, we see that Mark's hit a nerve. This hot girlfriend thing is a bitch. Mark calls after him
MARK: You don't even have a car!
TEACHER: Ben Wegner?
BEN: Adam Noris? Nothing. Teacher looks around.
TEACHER: Adam Noris? Nothing. Teacher looks around.
MARK: Miss Granada. Geometry.
CHARLIE: Holy crap. Where did you get that?
MARK: She's hard up, man. Equations don't keep you warm at night. They stop, see EVIL ED approaching. This amuses Mark and Ben. But Charlie's uncomfortable wants to bolt.
BEN: I think "it's" going to talk to us.
ED: ( TO CHARLIE )
MARK: "It's" going to talk to Brewster.
BEN: ( TO ED )
ED: ( RE: CHARLIE )
CHARLIE: ( to Ed/uncomfortable ) What's the deal, man?
ED: Ed stares Charlie down. A beat. Ben and Mark bust out laughing. Mark looks at Charlie.
MARK: Just the two of you. That's sweet. He can school you in the ways of It's important. "Brewster." The way Ed says his name is enough to propel Charlie into action. He grabs Ed and pulls him aside. Mark and Ben watch with interest out of earshot. Ed's tone is dire, serious as a heart attack.
ED: It's important. "Brewster." The way Ed says his name is enough to propel Charlie into action. He grabs Ed and pulls him aside. Mark and Ben watch with interest out of earshot. Ed's tone is dire, serious as a heart attack.
CHARLIE: What do you mean, he's missing?
ED: I keep trying him nothing. No texts, no phone. And he's not the only one who's gone. You heard roll call.
CHARLIE: So kids aren't coming to school. What do you want me to do about it?
ED: Meet me at his house after school. We'll check around. See what's up, if he's okay.
CHARLIE: I can't after school. I'm busy.
ED: I don't think you get what I'm
TELLING YOU: Look, do we have to do this here? Ed can't believe it. Charlie's totally blowing him off. He starts to lose it, raises his voice
CHARLIE: Look, do we have to do this here? Ed can't believe it. Charlie's totally blowing him off. He starts to lose it, raises his voice
ED: What, am I not even suppose to speak to you now?
CHARLIE: Keep it down. Don't spaz
ED: It's so horrible! Crossing the streams! Will High School as we know it cease to exist?! Ed glances at Mark and Ben, who still watch from a distance.
THE COSTUMES: Or how your first sexual experience was with an Electra figurine
CHARLIE: Or how your first sexual experience was with an Electra figurine
UIET: Or how your first sexual experience was with an Electra figurine
ED: Or how your first sexual experience was with an Electra figurine
CHARLIE: No. No.
ED: Then be my backup.
CHARLIE: ( DEFEATED )
ED: Don't be late. Moves off. Charlie sees the guys watching him. A beat. He shrugs like "I have no idea what that was about."
AMY: You know what I want? For dinner?
CHARLIE: You're eating right now, you know. As you speak. You literally just forced me to get you a smoothie so large they named a planet after it
AMY: ( LAUGHS )
CHARLIE: I watched you. But not in a creepy way. Charlie winces a little. It sounds creepy.
AMY: So don't judge. You don't want me to burn my big ole' booty off, do Charlie, on impulse, stops her kisses her.
CHARLIE: I don't know you're just.
AMY: ( PERFECT )
CHARLIE: ( PERFECT )
AMY: Look at Mom. She'sâ
CHARLIE: Look at Mom. She'sâ
AMY: Damn right. If he followed her home, you have to let her keep him. Amy laughs almost skips toward them, milking the moment.
ADAM: Charlie. I'm in front of Adam's. Remember the videos we all made back when? You and me and Adam, bro? In tights. Want your pals to get a load of that?
JANE: .so not a pool, what's the work you're doing?
JERRY: Foundation problems. I had to rip up half the basement.
JANE: These houses were built practically overnight. I'm never surprised when they come apart.
JERRY: ( RE: SPRINKLER )
JANE: Jerry, this is my son Charlie. And his do we say girlfriend now?
CHARLIE: ( EMBARRASSED )
AMY: ( shakes Jerry's hand ) Hi. I'm Amy. He can't help but give Amy an appreciative once-over. She enjoys it, but pulls away and moves closer to Charlie. Charlie notices the exchange the way this dude oozes manliness. Doesn't like it one bit. He shakes Jerry's hand a little too firmly. Lowers his voice a bit.
CHARLIE: Jerry's our new neighbor. The Perry place. He's "handy."
JANE: Jerry's our new neighbor. The Perry place. He's "handy."
AMY: ( looks to Charlie, smiles ) No kidding.
JERRY: Sorry about the mess, man. I was just telling your mom I'll have the dumpster gone next week.
CHARLIE: Doesn't bother me.
JANE: Jerry does night construction on the strip.
JERRY: ( noticing Charlie's shoes ) You play ball? I'm always looking for a pick up game.
CHARLIE: ( BLUFFING )
JANE: It's more of a collector thing. The shoes. He's obsessed. ( to Jerry/"those teens" ) They sleep on sidewalks to get Charlie looks at Jane, thanks for embarrassing me.
JERRY: Well they're bold. I like them.
JANE: Be neighborly.
JERRY: A drink, something. It hangs there, waiting for an invitation. Jane just smiles.
JANE: You bet. And thank you so much. For the help.
JERRY: Least I could do. Jane, Amy and Charlie walk toward the house. Jerry moves off. Amy looks at Jane, amazed.
AMY: Why did you blow him off? Oh my A guy that good-looking, still single? Bad bet. He's a player.
JANE: A guy that good-looking, still single? Bad bet. He's a player.
CHARLIE: ( IMPRESSED )
JANE: I've had enough man trouble. I'm not getting suckered again. Amy and Charlie meet eyes. That was loaded. Jane notices.
BROAD: Charlie's PHONE buzzes. He checks it.
CHARLIE: Charlie's PHONE buzzes. He checks it.
MOM: Charlie's PHONE buzzes. He checks it.
ON CHARLIE: CHARLIE ( CONT'D )
AMY: I have dinner on
JANE: I have dinner on
CHARLIE: I gotta go. I'll eat later.
JANE: But Charlie's already off and running.
ED: Where the hell have you been?
CHARLIE: You said after school, chill out! Ed is already lugging his big duffle to Adam's front door.
ED: Right after! It's dusk, dude, you know what that means!?
CHARLIE: That the sun's gone down. What's
THE BIG: Over him, Ed knocks loudly. Rings the bell.
ED: Hey! Anybody home? A long pause. Nothing.
CHARLIE: Not here. Let's go
CHARLIE: This is nuts. It's the SAME HOUSE we saw in the opening, but completely righted. TV is off, the walls are clean. Furniture in it's proper place. It's perfect. They move into the house. Ed is wired, scared.
ED: Hello? Ed and Charlie here!
CHARLIE: Okay. Fine. Ed opens his duffle bag. Inside are CROSSES, STAKES, HOLY WATER, even a small AX.
ED: Take this. Ed hands Charlie a STAKE. Charlie eyes it, incredulous.
CHARLIE: You've got to be kidding me. Ed stops. This is it.
ED: I hate to tell you this but that guy, your neighbor.
CHARLIE: My neighbor. Next door.
ED: I just met him. Jerry.
CHARLIE: I just met him. Jerry.
ED: A beat.
CHARLIE: That's a terrible vampire name. "Jerry." Seriously
ED: I didn't name him, man, I'm just reporting the facts! Ed moves UP THE STAIRS. Charlie reluctantly follows. It's darker up here. Lights off.
CHARLIE: Come on, this is a gag right? Ed's barely listening cautious. Every shadow is potential death. Total shmuck bait.
ED: Hey! Anybody here? They pass the empty MASTER BEDROOM where we saw ADAM's parents slaughtered. Now its clean and empty. Then Ed turns into ADAM's room. It's full of geekery. Action figures, the like. Charlie sticks behind him. The guys don't register the mostly obscured form of SOMEBODY HIDING BEHIND the door. A LARGE MALE figure. Ed catches sight of the guy, and SPINS toward it, freaked. Charlie also reacts, scared.
CHARLIE: ( ANGRY )
ED: No, see, it's not just them. It started there was this thing on Channel 13, a lady escaped an attacker who tried to bite her. Ed points to the RED DOTS on his chart. They form a loose circle around CHARLIE'S house.
BLACKED OUT: There's a ton of houses like that. People work nights on the strip
CHARLIE: There's a ton of houses like that. People work nights on the strip
ED: But every window? No. I've been watching him. It all fits
CHARLIE: That Jerry's a Dracula.
ED: No. Dracula is a specific vampire.
I'M SAYING: I know what you're saying! I'm mocking you. You've been reading too much Twilight
CHARLIE: I know what you're saying! I'm mocking you. You've been reading too much Twilight
ED: Fiction, okay? This is real. A real monster. And he's not brooding. Or lovesick. Or noble. He's the fucking shark from JAWS. He feeds, he kills, and he doesn't move on until everyone around him is dead.
CHARLIE: COME ON
COME ON: What about your neighbors, the Perrys? He moved into their house. Haven't seen them around, have you?
ED: What about your neighbors, the Perrys? He moved into their house. Haven't seen them around, have you?
CHARLIE: Yeah, in San Diego like a month Exception, proves the rule. You haven't asked him in, have you? He can't get in without an invitation.
ED: Exception, proves the rule. You haven't asked him in, have you? He can't get in without an invitation.
CHARLIE: No, but
ED: Your mom? Lonely divorcee.
CHARLIE: You're on drugs.
ED: No! Well, yeah. I thought you'd take my word, but I have evidence at home. Hard evidence. Charlie stops fighting it and humors him. Ed's lost it.
CHARLIE: Yeah. Okay.
ED: ( INTENSE )
CHARLIE: Right. Cause he's nocturnal.
ED: Just for okay for a minute pretend you're not a douche now
CHARLIE: Look, Ed, this stuff, it was fun when we were eight
ED: ( LOSING IT )
SIXTEEN: ( LOSING IT )
CHARLIE: ( LOSING IT )
ED: Right. Got it. You're soooo cool "Brewster." Go ahead, join the Clark High early-peakers. This is the pinnacle for them. And that includes your girl
CHARLIE: Shut up.
ED: Undeniably doable, but we used to make fun of her and her pals, remember? They're bimbos
CHARLIE: Shut up! Charlie barely refrains from hitting Ed. Instead he shoves him away. Ed stumbles. Falls. He looks up at Charlie, genuinely hurt and desperate.
ED: Adam's gone you act like it has nothing to do with you.
CHARLIE: Yeah. And you know when I got popular? The minute I stopped hanging out with you. Charlie takes off. Ed watches him go.
MARK: You crossed my yard. Tracked your nerdjuice all over it.
ED: Sorry. Sorry
MARK: My mom works hard on that shit,
MORON: Ed glances around nervously, it's dark and anything. else could be out there.
ED: Can you just hit me? I don't have time for the build up. ( he steels himself ) Jesus, man! Just do it! Fine. Mark winds up and SWINGS a brutal blow. Ed DUCKS and runs. Mark's immediately on his heels. The guys dodge and dart through the neighborhood. But Ed has experience in the art of losing bullies and he manages to shake Mark for a moment. Ed scrambles over a wooden fence, but his DUFFLE BAG GETS CAUGHT ON TOP. Most of his vamp hunting stuff SPILLS over on the OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE.
MARK: Jesus, man! Just do it! Fine. Mark winds up and SWINGS a brutal blow. Ed DUCKS and runs. Mark's immediately on his heels. The guys dodge and dart through the neighborhood.

Most of his vamp hunting stuff SPILLS over on the OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE.
MARK: A beat, Mark glances at the high fence. Decides he's done. He kicks some of Ed's stuff as he moves off.
ED: ( pounding on door ) Hey! Let me in! Please! But there's no answer. Ed is desperate, Sees Jerry closing in, walking across the backyard. Ed takes a ROCK and smashes the window over the kitchen sink.
ED: Forget it sucker! No invite! BAM! Jerry kicks in the kitchen door. Ed, terrified, falls Abandoned. I thought you did your You've been watching me. I've been watching you. Seems fair. Ed BOLTS into the house.
JERRY: Abandoned. I thought you did your You've been watching me. I've been watching you. Seems fair. Ed BOLTS into the house.
ED: You've been watching me. I've been watching you. Seems fair. Ed BOLTS into the house.
JERRY: You've been watching me. I've been watching you. Seems fair. Ed BOLTS into the house.
JERRY: Bit off more than you can chew. Shaking, terrified, Ed brandishes the STAKE.
ED: We'll see, man. I know my shit. But Jerry doesn't appear to be afraid. He looks at Ed with actual sympathy.
JERRY: Really? Who's going to believe you? You see the truth, but what good is it when you're alone? Ed's shaken but still grips the stake. Holding on.
ED: Don't play that stuff. That mind crap. Come on try me. Try me!
JERRY: You say you're glad you're different. But how can you be in a place like this? These people. Even your best friend. You're nothing to him now. Ed's listening despite himself, hurting now. Jerry moves a step in. Ed raises his stake again but with slightly less Get back!
ED: Get back!
JERRY: It can be over. I can make all that pain go away. Ed's fighting tears. Life as he knows it is gone.
ED: You were born for this and you know it. Your "life", what you had? That's the illusion. ( off Ed's silence ) I can take you somewhere great. Somewhere you'll belong. Ed takes this in. His eyes clear a bit. Is it.hope?
JERRY: You were born for this and you know it. Your "life", what you had? That's the illusion. ( off Ed's silence ) I can take you somewhere great. Somewhere you'll belong. Ed takes this in. His eyes clear a bit. Is it.hope?
JANE: Good on his word. A knock at the door. It's Amy. She lets herself in.
AMY: Morning. Charlie?
JANE: You try. My voice seems to be on some frequency he can't hear.
AMY: CHARLIE ( O.S. ) Amy looks at Jane, who shakes her head. Amy moves to the island. Grins a little.
CHARLIE!: CHARLIE ( O.S. ) Amy looks at Jane, who shakes her head. Amy moves to the island. Grins a little.
AMY: Talk to Hot Neighbor again? You should facebook him.
JANE: ( shakes her head ) Temptress. I'm resolved. Charlie runs down. Wet from the shower, discombobulated. pecks Amy, grabs food off a plate. He's out of sorts.
AMY: ( off her look ) Weird dreams. Charlie gives Jane a quick peck and follows Amy out.
CHARLIE: ( off her look ) Weird dreams. Charlie gives Jane a quick peck and follows Amy out.
AMY: Charlie snaps out of it. It's crazy to even entertain Ed's Nothing. That guy was such a tool.
CHARLIE: Nothing. That guy was such a tool.
AMY: ( HUMORING HIM )
TEACHER: Sally Cabella?
SALLY: Ed Lee? Nothing. Charlie looks up.
TEACHER: Ed Lee? Nothing. Charlie looks up.
ABOVE CHARLIE: SEATS ALL AROUND HIM ARE EMPTY. This time it makes an EXT. BASEBALL FIELD DAY Charlie, Mark, Ben and the rest of the guys get ready for practice. Mark's in the middle of a story, but Charlie is distracted barely listening.
MARK: .she's wearing a jumpsuit, dude. Like one zip and POP!
CHARLIE: What's up with you? Dreaming about your little boyfriend? Charlie takes this in, worried.
MARK: What's up with you? Dreaming about your little boyfriend? Charlie takes this in, worried.
CHARLIE: You see him around today? Ed?
BEN: I don't track "it's" whereabouts. What did he want, anyway?
CHARLIE: Nothing. Homework stuff. But Charlie's clearly distracted.
MARK: Now? You're ditching? I'll bail with you.
CHARLIE: No I'm I don't feel so well. He takes off. Ben and Mark watch him, perplexed.
VICTORIA: Yeah, Hi Mrs. Lee. Victoria breaks into a wide smile.
CHARLIE: Yeah, Hi Mrs. Lee. Victoria breaks into a wide smile.
VICTORIA: God you're a sight for sore eyes.
VICTORIA: Rick! Charlie's here!
CHARLIE: Oh, I you don't have to
RICK: Ed said you'd sprouted. And you're, the Rick awkwardly gestures around his face.
CHARLIE: Cleared up. Yes sir
VICTORIA: Ed will be so sorry he missed you, But you should both be in school now, shouldn't you?
CHARLIE: He's not here? Did you see him He's usually up and out early. Everything okay?
RICK: He's usually up and out early. Everything okay?
CHARLIE: No, sure. We're working on a class project. I guess we crossed paths.
VICTORIA: I'm so glad you're doing that. Ed, he'd be mad that I said so, but he talks about you all the time. This lands hard on Charlie. How remiss he's been.
CHARLIE: Yeah. That's. He's great.
VICTORIA: Of course. Make yourself at home. Charlie goes upstairs. Victoria makes a face at Rick "that's good!" They're both pleased.
ON CHARLIE: Ouch. Best not to dwell. He turns and sees PETER VINCENT'S "FRIGHT NIGHT" POSTER on a wall. Charlie takes it in, laughs a little. Then Charlie examines a WHOLE WALL devoted to Ed's investigation of Jerry. Maps, news reports, vampire lore printed off the internet, books, etc. If you didn't know the difference, you'd say it's just more of Ed's fictional world. Charlie stares at it all for a beat. Then shakes his head. It's all a fantasy nothing more.
CHARLIE: This is crazy. He starts to take off. But sees that Ed's computer is on and one file stands out. "THE JERRY DIARIES." Charlie gives in to his curiosity clicks it open finds a bunch of Quicktime files. He opens one. Stops.
OFF CHARLIE: Taking this in. Chilled.
JERRY: Hey guy. Charlie tries to maintain his cool. What if Jerry is what Ed thought? Impossible, but.
CHARLIE: Hey. Guy.
JERRY: You could really do me a solid.
CHARLIE: Yeah? What kind.
JERRY: I have a girl on her way over for a beer, and I'm totally out of beer. They're at Charlie's back door, the one that leads to the Set me up, I'll pay you back two times. A sixer for your mom, and one for you.
CHARLIE: Set me up, I'll pay you back two times. A sixer for your mom, and one for you.
JERRY: Set me up, I'll pay you back two times. A sixer for your mom, and one for you.
CHARLIE: Uh, yeah, sure.
JERRY: Nice kitchen. Same floor plan as my place, huh? Jerry leans against the door jamb BUT DOES NOT CROSS THE THRESHOLD. Charlie observes this. Holy shit. Charlie and Jerry MEET EYES. Then a cold smile creeps over Jerry's face. Charlie fumbles, lets one of the wet beers slide from his hand it hits the ground, explodes.
CHARLIE: Can I help you with that?
JERRY: Can I help you with that?
CHARLIE: No! No. Thanks. I'll get it. Jerry takes in Charlie's frantic refusal. Now he's darkly certain. He's been made. Charlie tosses the broken bottle into the sink. Moves to the doorway with the remaining beers. Charlie hands them over the threshold. But doesn't cross.
JERRY: This girl tonight she's a handful. You know.
CHARLIE: You don't mind my saying, you got a lot on your shoulders for a kid. Your pal, Amy? She's ripe. Must be a line of guys dying to pluck that. Your mom too you don't see it, maybe you do she's giving it off. It's on you to watch out for them. You up for Charlie's burning. But holds himself in check.
JERRY: You don't mind my saying, you got a lot on your shoulders for a kid. Your pal, Amy? She's ripe. Must be a line of guys dying to pluck that. Your mom too you don't see it, maybe you do she's giving it off. It's on you to watch out for them. You up for Charlie's burning. But holds himself in check.
CHARLIE: I think I can manage.
JERRY: Good. Cause there are bad people out there, man. Better keep an eye on your women. Jerry backs away, intimidating even as he retreats.
AMY: Where've you been? You told me to meet you here an hour ago.
CHARLIE'S POV: Jerry's nowhere to be seen and his house is quiet. Lights on behind BLACKED OUT WINDOWS.
CHARLIE: Sorry. You okay? Everything okay? He checks his phone. Checks for anything from ED. Nothing.
AMY: Yeah. Why shouldn't it be?
CHARLIE: No, it should. Nothing.
AMY: ( re: her book ) You ever read this? It's good. Sexy, actually. Amy moves to Charlie. Puts her arms around him.
CHARLIE: Like us, you mean. Amy laughs, pulls him onto the bed. She's feeling frisky.
AMY: Kinda makes it hotter.
CHARLIE: Yeah, so you keep saying. He smiles a little. She kisses him. But feels his distance.
AMY: Am I boring you? What's up?
CHARLIE: What? No. I'm kind of wiped out, that's all.
AMY: I can fix that. She kisses him again. Despite himself, Charlie gets drawn in and turned on. She pulls back, serious.
CHARLIE: now? Seriously?
AMY: Calm down. Let's just. see how it Charlie's dying inside. Now?! Could not be a worse time.
CHARLIE: Believeme when I saythereis nothing in the worldI'dratherdo
BUT: Charlie. Don't be nervous. She kisses him again. It's intense, passionate. Charlie weakens a little. Maybe death and mayhem can wait. Amy moves to take off her top. Oh. My. God DING DONG. Somebody is ringing the bell at Jerry's. Charlie stops. Practically tosses Amy off him.
AMY: Charlie. Don't be nervous. She kisses him again. It's intense, passionate. Charlie weakens a little. Maybe death and mayhem can wait. Amy moves to take off her top. Oh. My. God DING DONG. Somebody is ringing the bell at Jerry's. Charlie stops. Practically tosses Amy off him.
CHARLIE: You hear that? He rushes to the window. Looks outside.
CHARLIE'S POV: DORIS is at Jerry's front door. Holding a bottle of wine.
AMY: JERRY comes to the door. He and Doris start chatting. She's flirting up a storm.
CHARLIE: Shit, shit, shit Amy sees what Charlie sees. Shrugs.
AMY: He's hot. She's a stripper. They were bound to find each other.
CHARLIE: GO-GO DANCER ( LIGHTLY )
AMY: Take away two tiny pieces of cloth, You jealous?
CHARLIE: What? No Jerry is showing Doris in when he stops-and looks DIRECTLY AT CHARLIE. It's chilling. Charlie DIVES away from the window, grabbing Amy and pulling her down too.
AMY: Maybe. Not a big deal Charlie's freaked now. Doris is IN THERE.
CHARLIE: No, it is a big. A very big. He saw us and he was pissed.
AMY: Amy moves away. Looking at him skeptically.
CHARLIE: What? No! I am, I totally am. just I don't trust that guy. He glances out the window again. Amy's irritated, not used to having her passes rejected. She gathers her stuff.
AMY: I'm going.
CHARLIE: Amy. Don't
AMY: No. You've got your neighborhood watch thing.
CHARLIE: Come on, don't be that way But she's gone.
WHAM!!: A pale HAND slaps against the window. Charlie jumps.
CHARLIE: DORIS is in the window now. Bruised and so pale she looks almost BLUE.
DORIS: Oh my God. Oh, shit Charlie tugs on the door. Locked. He stands back, what to do? Charlie hears a NOISE. The FRONT DOOR. And then JERRY'S FOOTSTEPS approaching.
CHARLIE: Oh my God. Oh, shit Charlie tugs on the door. Locked. He stands back, what to do? Charlie hears a NOISE. The FRONT DOOR. And then JERRY'S FOOTSTEPS approaching.
DORIS: Oh. Oh no. Get me out of here! Doris pounds on the door. In a cold panic.
CHARLIE: I'm I won't leave you But Charlie has no choice. The footsteps are getting CLOSER.
DORIS: Please! No! Don't go!
CHARLIE: Please. Please. The bobby pin slips. Drops. Charlie's losing it. Steadies himself. Tries again.
CLICK: The lock slides open. Charlie breathes with relief. Then he grabs Doris and BOLTS. Charlie SLIPS in a pool of blood left behind from Jerry's feeding, but he manages to stay on his feet. He pushes Doris ahead of him, to a BACK STAIRCASE. His PHONE drops out of his pocket, he has to double back every moment counts. Doris's barely aware of what's happening, let alone where she is.
CHARLIE: Same floor plan. He grabs Doris and bolts for the kitchen.
DORIS: Thank you, thank you. Doris looks up at him, her EYES TURNING BLACK, her veins going gray. A first ray of pure sunlight hits them.
CHARLIE: In a flash, DORIS starts to BURN. Charlie is helpless to stop it as she GOES UP IN FLAMES and explodes.
CHARLIE REACTS: Horrified. In shock.
JANE: You're going to be late. Jane moves to the windows, throws the curtains open. Charlie winces at the sun. He got no sleep, looks like hell.
CHARLIE: Listen promise me that guy next door, Jerry? Under no circumstances do you invite him into our house. He's dangerous.
JANE: I think I can handle myself.
CHARLIE: No, no you can't
JANE CHARLIE: Charlie Don't even look in his direction, understand? And at night, you stay inside.
JANE: Because he's dangerous. What kind of dangerous? Charlie starts gathering his things. Getting ready to bolt.
CHARLIE: Can you trust me? For once, don't ask a million questions
JANE: Charlie. Stop. I'm your mom, not some ridiculous woman
CHARLIE: ( GENUINE )
JANE: That's enough. I'm done with this She moves away.
CHARLIE: Mom! Mom But she's gone. Charlie looks after her, worried.

JANE: ( takes this in/then ) You like her a lot, don't you? A moment when they could connect. But Charlie just nods. Jane's disappointed. Then
CHARLIE: He goes back to his work. Jane looks at him for a beat, then she starts to go.
CHARLIE: How'd you get in?!
AMY: It was unlocked.
CHARLIE: MOM! You have to lock the door!
AMY: Okay, whatever, listen. You're flipping out. Punching out your friends and blowing everything off and is that a stake? A beat. He forgot he was holding it. He hides it behind his Amy sits, upset. Looks around and sees that the living room is decked in more anti-vamp decor.
CHARLIE: Amy sits, upset. Looks around and sees that the living room is decked in more anti-vamp decor.
AMY: Look. Even if you're losing it you don't get to blow me off. You don't go from something to nothing You're not nothing to me, Charlie. Whatever's happening, just talk to me. Charlie takes this in, emotional. But

HIM: Let them run. Just makes them easier to kill when I'm done with Ding, ding, ding the family man's CAR DOOR is open and the warning bell rings over and over. CHARLIE eyes the car. Keys still in it. He circles Jerry, backing him off.
JERRY: Let them run. Just makes them easier to kill when I'm done with Ding, ding, ding the family man's CAR DOOR is open and the warning bell rings over and over. CHARLIE eyes the car. Keys still in it. He circles Jerry, backing him off.
CHARLIE: I repel you with the power of Christ the Lord.
JERRY: Do you? Really? When did you take your last confession?
CHARLIE: Get back.
JERRY: That's a mighty big cross you have there. Question is do you actually know how to use it? Jerry LUNGES for Charlie, but he DIVES for the family man's open car door. But Jerry's on him hands BURNING as he rips the cross from Charlie and shatters it with his hand. Then he TOSSES Charlie, who flies and hits JANE'S CAR, then crumples to the ground. Jerry gets Charlie around the neck holds a sharp, splintered end of the broken cross against Charlie's chest. The wood still burns into Jerry's hand, but Jerry holds on.
JANE: Leave my kid alone. Jane collapses, and we see that there's a lot of BLOOD on the back of her head.
CHARLIE: Jerry's in agony as he stumbles away, pulls the sign post out of his shoulder. Charlie grabs his mom and drags her into her wreck of a car. Amy dives into the car with them. Charlie presses the accelerator. Will it still drive?
COP #1: So a gas leak caused the fire at your home and.
CHARLIE: My mom didn't feel right, we were trying to get her to the hospital. It was stupid to let her drive.

JANE: Who lies motionless in a bed. A doctor checks her chart. AMY hangs up. Charlie, finished with the cops, joins her. They're both pained as they look at Jane.
CHARLIE: Like what? A vampire moved next door, borrowed some beer, ate a stripper and then blew up our house because we wouldn't invite him in? Amy looks at him.
AMY: The DOCTOR approaches.
DOCTOR: You should get some rest.
CHARLIE: She's going to wake up, right?
DOCTOR: Assuming the swelling is minimal, I hope so.
CHARLIE: But you don't know.
DOCTOR: Not yet. We need to give it time. The doctor puts a hand on Charlie's shoulder, leaves. Charlie turns away, upset. Amy watches, feeling helpless.
ASSISTANT: Bye babe. Good show tonight. He's barely paying attention.
PETER: You were late again on "The Devil's Torture Chamber." But she's gone. A beat. He moves back toward the library shelves. As he does he notices the PHOTOS Charlie took at Jerry's place.
CHARLIE: This is my fault.
AMY: You didn't make any of it happen.
CHARLIE: Ed came to me. I turned my back on How were you supposed to believe him? None of it makes sense.
AMY: How were you supposed to believe him? None of it makes sense.
CHARLIE: He did talk a lot of demented crap. ( but.. ) He was my best friend. He asked me, begged me, to believe him.
AMY: People change. Everybody
CHARLIE: Yeah they do. I turned into a dick. I figured my dweeb past, not big with the ladies.
AMY: ( WRY )
CHARLIE: I wanted you to like me. I tried to erase Ed all of it. I know how that feels.
AMY: I knew you were a dweeb. ( off his look ) You think I want a "dude" like Mark or Ben? I like that you're different. It didn't hurt that your skin cleared up. She smiles, takes his hand. A sweet, connected moment. Then something alarming occurs to Amy:
CHARLIE: No, seriously. I'm going to die a virgin? Me? How did this happen?
AMY: No, seriously. I'm going to die a virgin? Me? How did this happen?
CHARLIE: We're not going to die
AMY: But what if we do? Let's do it. Now. The bathroom. Charlie. A beat.
CHARLIE: I think we should kill the vampire first. I'll perform much better. They laugh trying not to cry. Then:
AMY: Oh my God, Charlie. What are we going to do?
CHARLIE: We're going to fight. Then Charlie's phone rings. He answers.
PETER: I can help you. My place. One EXT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY DAY A few minutes later. Charlie and Amy move out of Jane's The Peter Vincent?
AMY: The Peter Vincent?
CHARLIE: Under-whelming, believe me. But he's what we've got. They close Jane's door and we see that it's COVERED in CROSSES of every shape and size. It's quite a spectacle. A nurse passes, looks at Charlie and Amy quizzically.
CLOSE ON: A MIDORI cocktail and Charlie sit nearby.
PETER: I'll tell you what I know, but that's it. Don't expect me to join your Scooby gang.
CHARLIE: Anything. I'll take it.
PETER: I found the origin of that insignia you showed me. It's a species that originated in the Mediterranean. They nest in the earth explains that hole you saw. And they kill slowly, keep their victims alive for days.
CHARLIE: So they turn all of them? Make their victims into vampires.
AMY: I know. I read.
PETER: No. It takes a while before they complete the change. They usually finish them off before that.
AMY: So how do you kill these guys, this Usual stuff. But it's a strong breed. You need a plan A VOICE interrupts over an intercom. It's ARTHUR, Peter's ARTHUR ( O.S. ) Delivery. Guy says you need to sign for something.
PETER: Usual stuff. But it's a strong breed. You need a plan A VOICE interrupts over an intercom. It's ARTHUR, Peter's ARTHUR ( O.S. ) Delivery. Guy says you need to sign for something.
PETER: Send him in.
CHARLIE: ( ALARMED )
PETER: I don't know. Maybe Charlie stands.
CHARLIE: No. You said he could come in. The delivery guy. That's
AMY: What? Charlie
ED: Looking at them now. Yes sir. ( hangs up/then ) He's modern, Jerry, dispensed with all that "master" stuff.
CHARLIE: You've got a problem, keep it with Problem? You let him get me, man.
ED: Problem? You let him get me, man.
CHARLIE: ( ANGUISHED ) I KNOW
I KNOW: Ed is CREEPING TOWARD Charlie.
AMY: You let him turn me into this. At that, ED VAMPS. Black eyes, black veins. Those teeth. It's terrifying. SMASH!! One of the cabinets shatters. Ed, Charlie and Amy spin to see PETER standing by the open collection case. A SMALL NAIL in his hand. He's shaking like a leaf.
CHARLIE: You let him turn me into this. At that, ED VAMPS. Black eyes, black veins. Those teeth. It's terrifying. SMASH!! One of the cabinets shatters. Ed, Charlie and Amy spin to see PETER standing by the open collection case. A SMALL NAIL in his hand. He's shaking like a leaf.

PETER: Stay away, demon.
ED: ( amused/queens accent ) "Stay awaaaay, demon!" Ed closes in on Peter. Peter looks to Charlie. It's real.
PETER: Crucifixion nail. Lethal to you.
ED: Old school. Nice. Got to get pretty close to use it, though. Peter looks at the short piece of metal in his hand. Fuck. HE BOLTS down the nearest hallway.
CHARLIE: The elevator!
ED: A panic room!? You better panic, loser! You better watch your neck!
AMY: Oh my God, oh my God. Amy's starting to lose it. Charlie grabs her.
CHARLIE: Look at me. Stop.
ED: Give it up, Chuck! You're dead.
ON ED: As he comes around the same corner a moment later. AMY and CHARLIE are NOWHERE to be seen.
GUARD: Sign in, please.
JERRY: I know where I'm going.
GUARD: Sign in. No exceptions. Jerry ignores him, keeps moving toward the elevator.
ED: I expected more of a fight. Girl's made you lazy in the head. Pussy'll do that. ED YANKS the curtain on the confessional open. ARTHUR hides there, terrified.
CLOSE ON: A large cabinet on the other side of the room. AMY AND CHARLIE are squeezed behind it. They react to HORRIBLE SCREAMS as Ed rips ARTHUR apart.
ON ED: His face bloodied. Eyes wild. The trembling body of ARTHUR on the ground at his feet. Ed turns Arthur over. Arthur's still breathing, reaches for something around his neck. A cross? No, it's a chain with PICTURES of sweet-faced children on silver charms.
HE PLEADS: .I have .kids .
ARTHUR: .I have .kids .
ED: Ed lifts Arthur off his feet and chokes him with one hand.
ED: I know you're here. I can hear you breathing. It's totally cool. He laughs, hyper. Excited.
CHARLIE: Amy bolts from the room as Charlie punches the glass out on another case that holds the battle axe. He grabs the weapon. Ed SHOVES the cabinet off him with his good hand, stands. Charlie and Ed face off.
GO!: Amy bolts from the room as Charlie punches the glass out on another case that holds the battle axe. He grabs the weapon. Ed SHOVES the cabinet off him with his good hand, stands. Charlie and Ed face off.
ED: Mano e.one mano. Piece of cake. Cause I'm a God Damned killing machine, and you're like all the Clark High big shots nothing.
CHARLIE: I didn't pick
ED: You didn't think. Charlie's wrecked about what he has to do.
CHARLIE: I know. I'm sorry. Charlie takes a swing with the AXE. Ed starts BOUNDING around the room, avoiding Charlie's swings as he clings to walls and, impossibly, THE CEILING.
ED: Steeeerike! Call that a swing, Charlie swings and swings, but Ed is too fast for him. Finally, Charlie connects with ED'S NECK. Blood flies, Charlie can't look anguished.
AMY: She smashes into one GLASS CABINET after another, pulling out and pocketing everything she can find to fight ED. Finds a GUN loaded with silver bullets.
JERRY: You are something, aren't you? Amy spins. Jerry's closing in on her. Beautiful, seductive. She's shaking, terrorized. BAM, BAM, BAM!! She empties the GUN into JERRY anyway. It knocks him back, but he's still standing. He picks a silver bullet out of his shoulder, unimpressed.
AMY: She RUNS.
ED: Bone is a motherfucker, Chuckles. Hard to cut. Charlie takes another swing with his axe. Ed jumps out of the way.
AMY: Do it. Charlie! Charlie's frozen. Ed starts to get up, his head a mess. It's now or never.
ED: Wow. Bimbo has some juice
AMY: Jerry's here. He's coming!
CHARLIE: ( to Ed/pained ) I'm sorry. WHAP, Charlie stakes ED in the heart. Ed looks at Charlie with surprise. Ed's hideous features seem to dissolve. For a brief moment he looks like himself again.
ED: I wasn't even a badass vamp. I was his Renfield. Funny if you Ed starts to VIBRATE HORRIBLY, his WHOLE BODY moving so impossibly fast he's little more than a BLUR. Then he BURNS UP FROM THE INSIDE OUT. Charlie's paralyzed in a world of hurt. Amy grabs him. Pulls him out of the room.
AMY: I found the stairs. Come on.
AMY: OVER HERE
OVER HERE: She flings the door to the stairwell open and they RACE DOWN
AMY: Stop. Stop, I need to
CHARLIE: Not now. He's coming for us.
AMY: He can't kill us, not here
CHARLIE: Who's going to notice? Who's going to care? Amy, look around
AMY: Oh, God.
CHARLIE: Keep moving. Come on. Now Charlie sees JERRY some distance behind them now, moving toward them in the crowd. They meet eyes. Charlie grabs Amy, scans for someplace to hide. He spots a nightclub "REFLECTIONS". The outside walls are all mirrored, like a brightly lit Behind them in the crowd, he sees them slip into the club.
ON JERRY: Behind them in the crowd, he sees them slip into the club.
DJ: Tequila Man t-shirts! Yeeeeeahhhh! The crowd goes nuts, SURGES forward. Someone bumps Amy and Charlie and they lose hands.
AMY: Charlie turns, a DRUNK CHICK gets in his way tries to dance with him. He pushes past her.
CHARLIE: Amy? Amy! Charlie can't see Amy, instead sees HIMSELF over and over again in a series of mirrors the infinity effect. It's dizzying, disorienting. THEN HE SEES JERRY, a shark, moving in and out of the crowd, disappearing behind mirrored columns, reemerging. Charlie also sees that JERRY DOESN'T REFLECT in the mirrors around them. Instead the crowd parts as if by magic. Jerry's heading straight toward
AMY: who's been pushed toward the DJ stand by the crowd. She's spinning, looking desperately for Charlie.
JERRY: Holding her with a firm grip.
AMY: No. No! Amy STRUGGLES and CRIES OUT as JERRY PULLS HER away from CHARLIE, toward ramp that leads to another dance floor. Jerry laughs, throws her over his shoulder.
GUY: Go get her, man! AMY sees her fast-moving reflection in the mirror she appears to be FLOATING above the people.
AMY: Help me! Help!! CHARLIE can SEE HER, but can't get to her. The crowd is indifferent to her cries. Charlie grabs his cell hits a button. It dials, then
CHARLIE: ( INTO PHONE )
HER: INT. PETER'S PANIC ROOM NIGHT Peter's holding his cell. It's ringing. He hangs up.
AMY: Charlie's coming, he'll find me
JERRY: I'm counting on it. Amy SPITS on him. Jerry reacts a flash of RAGE and he exposes his brutal rows of TEETH for just an instant.
CHARLIE: Amy! No! BAM! A hand falls on his shoulder.
A DOORMAN: How'd you get in here?
DOORMAN: How'd you get in here?
CHARLIE: You have to help me. That guy, he's going to kill her, he's a
KILLER: The doorman glances at JERRY and AMY. Jerry stokes Charlie's anguish running his hands over Amy's ass, kissing her Yeah? Then she's liking it. Charlie's beside himself, enraged and terrorized.
DOORMAN: Yeah? Then she's liking it. Charlie's beside himself, enraged and terrorized.
CHARLIE: You don't understand!
DOORMAN: ID. Then you can tell me your whole sad story
CHARLIE: No! There's no time Amy!! Charlie's increasingly desperate, tries to RUN. But the doorman has a good grip, pulls him back.
JERRY: Sees that CHARLIE is restrained. Jerry locks eyes with Charlie and SMILES, his horrible fangs exposed. He's taking Charlie's woman and enjoying it.
CHARLIE'S POV: As he's being dragged away JERRY BRUTALLY BITES AMY. It's a nightmare. Charlie loses it, screaming and flailing. But there is no helping her.
PETER: How'd you get in here?
CHARLIE: Security's a little lax. Everybody got their throat ripped out. Peter backs away as Charlie moves in. Charlie is different. Colder, harder. Like he's aged a decade in one night.
PETER: You too? He change you?
CHARLIE: Look at your monitor. PETER turns to a security monitor in his closet. Charlie
PETER: Don't you get what this is? There's no fighting. There's only surviving, if you're lucky
CHARLIE: You call this surviving? If you live and we all die, you think you'll ever be able to get us out of your head?
PETER: I know I won't. I never could not after the first time. This stops Charlie.
CHARLIE: Made what up?
PETER: The vampire who killed my parents, my brothers. But not me. I hid. Charlie reacts. Surprised, but now it all makes sense. Peter continues, haunted
CHARLIE: So do it. We'll go in at dawn. He's got to rest sometime
PETER: ( HARD )
CHARLIE: So you bail on people, erase them.
PETER: Peter takes something from his luggage. A stake carved from WHITE WOOD. He hands it to Charlie.
CHARLIE: ( RE: STAKE )
PETER: Who knows what's for real any more. Charlie takes the stake. Starts to go. Peter stops him
CHARLIE: I'll figure it out.
PETER: No, you need a plan. To stake him, you have to get close he's stronger than you.
CHARLIE: Holy water?
PETER: Slow him down. Won't stop him.
CHARLIE: But if he's on fire, how do I get close enough to stake him? A beat.
PETER: ( POINTED )
CHARLIE: ( POINTED )
STORE GUY: Good for you. The store guy waits. Charlie hands over his money.
CHARLIE: Let's do this shit. He swallows hard, scared but determined.
NO AMY: Finally, Charlie hears a GROAN. He opens a window in the door for yet another room. AMY'S lying on the floor, turned away from him. Charlie's not sure what he'll see when he gets a better look at her.
CHARLIE: Amy slowwwwly gets up, turns. And aside from a BRUISED BITE MARK on her neck she looks normal. She rushes to Charlie, keeps her voice down.
AMY: Amy slowwwwly gets up, turns. And aside from a BRUISED BITE MARK on her neck she looks normal. She rushes to Charlie, keeps her voice down.
AMY: She reaches through the window. They link hands, emotional.
CHARLIE: She reaches through the window. They link hands, emotional.
CHARLIE: Where is he?
AMY: I don't know. He dumped me here. I'm bait. He said so
CHARLIE: How do you feel?
AMY: I'll survive. Please get out of here. He's too strong
CHARLIE: I'm stronger.
CHARLIE: Shit! You
PETER CHARLIE: Sorry How'd you A beat. Then:
PETER: Guess I don't want to be a man like me either. Peter opens his leather coat it's loaded with weapons. And a flask. Peter grins.
CHARLIE: ( RE: FLASK )
PETER: Don't get greedy. I'm here.
CHARLIE: Wooden bullets? Nice.
PETER: No, you think I'm fucking MacGyver? Bullet, bullets. They'll buy us some time. Charlie is grateful, but now's not the time for man hugs.
CHARLIE: We have to find Amy. She was in a room upstairs, then she just disappeared. This house
PETER: What do you mean she "disappeared?"
CHARLIE: She was there. I looked away, looked back she was gone. Peter takes this in.
PETER: Show me where.
CHARLIE: Where does it go?
PETER: Only one way to find out.
CHARLIE: Wait you're going in?
PETER: See that? Like a great date. Get me drunk and I'll try anything. Peter lets go and FALLS. Charlie steels himself, goes in after him.
PETER: Ow, crap. They look around eyes adjusting. There's barely any They're in a LARGE UNFINISHED BASEMENT. The floor is dirt and the main story of the house is held up by numerous
ON CHARLIE: As he sees something. Stops. A MOUND of dirt. Like a grave. Charlie indicates to Peter to follow him. They whisper:
CHARLIE: You uncover him. I'll light him up, then stake him. Charlie pulls a FABRIC MASK, like a ski mask, over his face. Peter looks at him.
PETER: You should be a magician. As the face emerges, Charlie readies a match, then reaches for his STAKE
CHARLIE: Adam. I know him. Knew him.
PETER: Shh. Don't wake him up, for
CHRIST'S: Peter stops. He's looking over Charlie's shoulder, In the dirt behind CHARLIE are MORE GRAVES. Eight or ten at least. Charlie turns. Sees the graves.
CHARLIE: Ms. Granada. My geometry teacher.
PETER: How about we go back to my "run away" plan?
CHARLIE: ( IGNORING HIM )
PETER: I thought you're here for Amy. ( off Charlie's look ) Great. Right. Save the Geometry A SCREAM stops him. Amy. Charlie and Peter spin it's coming from behind the door to the other room. A beat. They're both petrified as they move toward the door. Peter readies the gun again. Charlie pulls a CROSS out along with the stake. They creep toward the door.
JERRY: You look bigger on TV. Peter fires the shotgun, BLAM! But he misses Jerry and the power of the blast sends PETER
CHARLIE: Amy, God. She clings to him, near tears.
AMY: INT. JERRY'S BASEMENT DAY Peter scrambles on the ground, SHOTGUN trained on JERRY who moves toward him calmly. The cross on the gun the only thing holding him back.
BLAM!: Peter fires again grazes JERRY.
JERRY: In pain, he TRANSFORMS and VAMPS before our eyes with a blood- curdling yell. It's chilling.
AMY: You should have run with me while we had the chance. You should have saved me, Charlie.
CHARLIE: It's not too late. She brings her lips close to his ear. Rasps.
AMY: It is. He's inside me now. Her EYES GO DARK fingernails grow SHARP and dig into Charlie. He feels the change.
CHARLIE: Charlie shoves her off, hard. But she holds him tight and they TUMBLE INTO THE GRAVE.
AMY: Charlie shoves her off, hard. But she holds him tight and they TUMBLE INTO THE GRAVE.
JERRY: It's over, guy. Charlie his girl's having her way with him.
PETER: Stop! Stop! Desperate, he BLASTS them again. Hits one on the shoulder. But it's not stopping them.
JERRY: And your aim
PETER: You don't get it! I'm on your Peter smiles a little. Shows his rows of SHARP FANGS. Jerry and the others stop. What?
AMY: You wouldn't.
CHARLIE: Try me. She STRADDLES HIM, sexual and raw. Charlie's repulsed, I'll be the best you ever had. The only you had.
AMY: I'll be the best you ever had. The only you had.
CHARLIE: I know. He backs away from her. Into
CHARLIE: Get off him! He hits MS. GRANADA off Peter. Manages to hold off JERRY for a beat. Spins and HITS ADAM in the head.
ADAM: AMY enters from the other room already healing. Jerry sees her holds up a hand and backs the others off.
CHARLIE: AMY enters from the other room already healing. Jerry sees her holds up a hand and backs the others off.
JERRY: I'll finish this. Jerry, all swagger, moves in on Charlie. Charlie sees Peter, barely alive, spit out his FAKE VAMP teeth. Peter meets his gaze, wry and weak. Done for.
PETER: Worth a shot. "Master of Now Charlie notices SHOTGUN not far from Peter's body. He dives for it, but Jerry steps on it kicks it away.
JERRY: ( TO CHARLIE )
FEET: Charlie, enraged, SPRAYS JERRY WITH GAS FROM the CANISTER right in the eyes. Jerry recoils, HISSING. Adam and the OTHER VAMPS MOVE IN. Jerry's over it. He's on CHARLIE in a flash, FANGS BARED. About to RIP HIS NECK OUT.
BLAM!: PETER has the gun again has managed to pull himself up into a sitting position. He BLOWS away ONE OF THE SUPPORT BEAMS. BLAM! And ANOTHER. BLAM! And ANOTHER. BLAM he misses.
PETER: BLAM! AND ANOTHER. Charlie DIVES for SAFETY as the CEILING COLLAPSES in part of the basement. SUNLIGHT STREAMS in forcing JERRY, AMY and the other vamps into a corner.
BLAM!: Another BEAM collapses. BURYING JERRY, AMY and the others under DEBRIS from the floor above. A stunned beat. Peter slumps, exhausted from the effort.
CHARLIE: Yeah you are. Peter looks at him, sad.
PETER: Get out of here. We don't have much time before they dig out.
CHARLIE: ( RE: STAKE )
PETER: You're a brave mother, I get it. And you were right. This is how I had to go. But we didn't count on an army.
CHARLIE: He'll kill you both, he said
PETER: We're already dead.
CHARLIE: A last desperate attempt. He can see Jerry's HEART, about to burn away.
NO!: A last desperate attempt. He can see Jerry's HEART, about to burn away.
JERRY: Still burning, looks down as the STAKE OF SAINT MICHAEL in his CHEST. Right through the heart. He starts to SHAKE VIOLENTLY faster and faster, just like Ed did becoming little more than a macabre BLUR. For a moment Jerry's human form hangs in the air.
JERRY: Blow me.
ON AMY: Transformed and healed. Herself again. She rushes to the edge of the open grave.
AMY: She crawls into the grave. Cradles Charlie in her arms.
CHARLIE: Blow me? Seriously? Peter falls back exhausted. Laughing.
MS. GRANADA: Let's agree to never talk about INT. PETER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT Charlie, Amy, Jane and Peter are in Peter's penthouse. It's a glittering night, a spectacular view.
JANE: Think you'll ever feel the same about a nighttime sky?
PETER: Same as what? I was always Right. We're just catching up.
JANE: Right. We're just catching up.
CHARLIE: I'm not seeing that.
AMY: She deserves some fun. Your mom fully cheated death.
CHARLIE: ( SUGGESTIVE )
AMY: Oh, I plan on it. Now that you've killed your first vampire.
CHARLIE: I am so going to perform. Charlie KISSES her. It's intense, passionate. It's different, they're different. The childish part of them long He runs his hands through her hair, pulls her close. SOMETHING BEEPS, talks.
VOICE: "Frak!" "Frak!"
AMY: ( PULLS BACK )
CHARLIE: It was Ed's. Amy smiles a little, softens.
AMY: It was Ed's. Amy smiles a little, softens.
CHARLIE: It was Ed's. Amy smiles a little, softens.
AMY: ( THEN )
PETER: Frak! Right on.
AMY: I'll take another. Thanks.
CHARLIE: ( TO PETER )
PETER: It's dark. ( off his look ) I'm on the "day" wagon.
CHARLIE: Thanks for inviting us.
PETER: We should celebrate. Being alive. Your mom's clean bill of health.
CHARLIE: You wanted to put the moves on her.
PETER: What? No. What?
CHARLIE: Just I'm watching you. I've got to look out for her.
PETER: Yeah you do. So here's what I'm thinking. We faced the beast and we won. Can you imagine the possibilities if we had got that shit on film?
CHARLIE: VAMPIRES DON'T
VAMPIRES DON'T: Show up on film, yeah. But werewolves do, bigfoots do. We get proof, catch something we could build a stage act around that, you wouldn't believe. We'd blow those Cirque bitches away!
PETER: Show up on film, yeah. But werewolves do, bigfoots do. We get proof, catch something we could build a stage act around that, you wouldn't believe. We'd blow those Cirque bitches away!
CHARLIE: An act? Seriously? What about saving people from evil? What
ABOUT: A CHILLING LAUGH interrupts them. Distant. Eerie. And somehow familiar. Peter nods to his COLLECTION CABINETS.
PETER: It happens. All this stuff.
CHARLIE: Ever think about collecting something else? Snow globes or Charlie stops, catches sight of something MOVING IN THE
