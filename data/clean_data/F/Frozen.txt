FROZEN: Written by Adam Green
LYNCH: I don't see her.
DAN: The shift change is late.   Just wait.
PARKER: Are you sure about this?
DAN: We've been doing this forever. Trust me. This lady loves Lynch. She always goes for it.
LYNCH: I'm cute.
PARKER: Is um... is that her?
DAN: Shit.
LYNCH: Dude.
DAN: It's cool, it's cool. (to Parker) Look, all you have to do is smile real pretty and tell him-
PARKER: -What?   Me? No way.    This is your thing.
DAN: easy. All you do is tell the guy that you and your friends-
LYNCH: -GIRLfriends. Say "girlfriends".
DAN: -you and your girlfriends forgot your credit card and you can't pick up your lift tickets.
PARKER: Dan, no.   You do it.    I feel stupid.
DAN: You've got this.    You can totally do this.
LYNCH: Parker, you've so got this.
DAN: The worst thing that happens is he says no. He won't say no. No one ever says no.
PARKER: Why me?
LYNCH: `Cause you're a girl.
DAN: A very beautiful girl with a very charming smile. (then) Just... DAN (cont'd) There.
PARKER: My charming smile?
PARKER: Hey. PARKER (cont'd) Could I bum a smoke? PARKER (cont'd) Thanks. PARKER (cont'd) I'm Parker.
JASON: Jason.
PARKER: Oh, cool.    My brother's name is Jason.
PARKER: Yeah, so I don't want to waste your time and bullshit you cause you seem like a wicked busy guy and everything...but..this is gonna sound so stupid... PARKER (cont'd) My girlfriends and I drove all the way up here from Salem State, and I was sort of the dumbass who told everyone that I could cover the lift tickets on my Mom's credit card...but then I left her credit card at the gas station...and so...
JASON: Right.
PARKER: No- but I mean, we totally have some cash and stuff. We just don't have enough to cover all 3 lift tickets, you know?
JASON: How much?
PARKER: Like...fifty?
JASON: I could lose my job.
LYNCH: He's not going for it.
DAN: Will you shut up? He's gonna go for it. It's either stand there and do the job for minimal... minimal, what is it?
LYNCH: Minimum.
DAN: -Minimum wage or do it for minimum wage plus a little bit more.
LYNCH: She had to come skiing with us?
DAN: You said you didn't mind?
LYNCH: I don't.   I don't mind.   Don't mind at all.
A: -I watched the game with you last week!
LYNCH: For ten minutes, Dan. Football games are more than ten minutes.
M: They're lots of ten minutes-es, you know?
DAN: Dude, I have a girlfriend now. I love this girl. I don't know what you...
LYNCH: It's not a problem. It's not. Forget I ever said anything.
LYNCH: You did great.
PARKER: There isn't any.
M: You gave him the full hundred?
PARKER: He wasn't going for it at 50.
LYNCH: I would have asked for change.
PARKER: It's still way cheaper than paying for tickets, right?
LYNCH: I would have definitely asked him for change.
JASON: (scoffs at Parker) "Girlfriends"?
M: (teasing) Oh, now I'm "baby"?     You never call me pet names.
DAN: I'm just not a `pet name' guy.
PARKER: Yeah but you're supposed to call me something affectionate, you know? Like "honey" or "sweetie".
LYNCH: I hooked up with a girl last semester that called me by my last name in bed. It was so weird. "Oh, Lynch! Your hair is so soft! Do me harder, Lynch!" It was like I was throwing it to Dan over here.
DAN: See? At least I don't call you "O'Neil".
PARKER: You don't touch my face enough either.
LYNCH: (to no one imparticular)
A: Watch it, Lynch.
LYNCH: Hey, that's not fair. I'm not dating you, you don't get to make my life suck.
DAN: Wha-? I never said that. I never said you make my life suck. (then, forced) Sweetie.
LYNCH: (to Parker) Dan tells me you're getting the hang of that board?
PARKER: I wouldn't say that. But last time we went I did pretty good, right?
DAN: You did awesome. I'm telling you, the first few times are frustrating but once you get the hang of it, it's like riding a bike.
(MORE): DAN(cont'd) (to Lynch's skis) Are you gonna trade in those ancient things for a board?
LYNCH: Please. Snowboards are too EMO for me. Give it ten more years and that fad will be dead.
A: You know what, I am so sick of potheads giving me shit about smoking butts.
M: At least pot does something for you. Cigarettes are just gross. Especially out in the cold. It like sticks to you and then you smell like a mixture of ash tray and an old man's used floss.
DAN: No, I have never- why would I ever sniff my floss? Why am I friends with you? DAN (cont'd) Gimme a drag.
PARKER: What time do you think we'll get back? I have about 2 weeks worth of chapters to read tonight.
LYNCH: Oh no. She broke the rule.
DAN: No worrying about the bullshit of real life. The whole point of this
A: is to relax and have fun. Worry about school when you get home.
PARKER: But, I haven't read a-
LYNCH: Uh-oh! Is someone afraid of heights?
PARKER: No.
LYNCH: So it doesn't bother you when I do this?
PARKER: Quit it! PARKER (cont'd) I'm not afraid of heights.   I just
DAN: Baby, in the whole history of time, only one chair has ever fallen off
PARKER: Points for calling me "baby" but you just made that statistic up.
A: Yeah, statistics don't work on smokers.
M: (nervous laughter) Oh, shut-up.
DAN: Actually, I paid good money.
LYNCH: Yeah, but I'm gonna pay you back so it's like the same thing.
PARKER: Why do I have to wear a helmet?
PARKER: But you guys don't wear them.
M: PARKER (cont'd) I only see little kids wearing them.
DAN / LYNCH: Awww.
PARKER: You're just doing this to make fun of me.
DAN: No, I'm not. I swear.    You look hot in a helmet.
LYNCH: Need some help?
PARKER: Aww, check out Lynch.
LYNCH: Woah! Shit, man!    I was just trying to help!
SHANNON: Ryan, what the hell?
RYAN: He had his hands all over you!
SHANNON: No he didn't. I can take care of myself!
LYNCH: I was seriously just trying to help. I mean, how could I even
A: compete with a catch like that?
SHANNON: (laughs)
M: Are you OK?
LYNCH: Yeah, I'm fine.
SHANNON: Well, thank you for your help.    I am so, so sorry about that.
LYNCH: Joe.
SHANNON: Well it was nice to meet you.
LYNCH: (to his friends) I was like one second away from beating that guy's ass.
DAN: I know you were, man.   Come on. Don't sweat it.
LYNCH: Seriously, that guy was such a dick.
DAN: I'm tough.
PARKER: Are you kidding? We are totally doing this every weekend. In fact, if they were open during the week I'd say we should cut class, too.
LYNCH: Last one to the bottom is buying dinner!
DAN: We gotta take a weekend trip up
DAN: Done. When I stayed with my cousin out West two years ago it was like
M: the stuff you see in commercials. We had to take like 3 lifts to get to the top and it was powder as far as you could see.
LYNCH: Well, speaking of good skiing... it's been cool doing the bunny hill
LYNCH: No, it's fine. I'm just saying let's step it up a notch at some point. It's been cool watching Parker fall on her ass all day but I would like to actually ski at some point.
PARKER: You know, I've probably had enough for today anyway. I can just stay in the lodge if you guys want to go-
LYNCH: -no, no, no that's not what I meant. I didn't mean it like that.
PARKER: I told you I didn't have to come.
A: Parker, I didn't not want you to come.
M: It was his idea that we invited you in the first place.
LYNCH: Exactly. Remember? I was like "Hey man, why doesn't Parker come
DAN: -I was like, "OK that would be cool".
PARKER: It's OK, you guys. The last thing a girl wants to do is intrude on "guy time". I won't be offended. I've got stuff I could do anyway. (to Dan) Actually, can I have the key? I should check my messages.
DAN: No. No locker key. I can tell you right now that every message on there is going to be from your Mom giving you more aggravation about whatever the hell.
PARKER: She does not.
DAN: Ready for this? Two nights ago we were watching a movie and her Mom
A: kept calling and calling. (to Parker) And what did she want?
M: DAN (cont'd) She wanted to know if we wanted to have chicken soup or vegetable soup with Christmas dinner. Christmas dinner! Four weeks away, and she had to now right then and there what kind of soup we'd prefer.
PARKER: I'm sorry if I ruined skiing for you today.
LYNCH: You didn't! You didn't at all! You missed the part before you walked over here when I was all like, "Dude, this has been so cool...you know...doing..."
M: Joe!
LYNCH: (to his friends) Wait up.
SHANNON: Hey. I just wanted to apologize again.
SHANNON: Ex. He's my ex-boyfriend. We're, you know, trying to still be friends and everything but as you can see, that's not really gonna work.
LYNCH: (teasing) No way.
SHANNON: A group of us all agreed to go skiing this weekend and well, whatever. It's a whole story and-
LYNCH: Where, here? Yeah, probably, yes.
A: Cool. Well, my roommate and I come like every Sunday, so maybe I'll see you.
M: That would be...a nice time.
SHANNON: OK.   See ya later.
LYNCH: Actually, you know what? Would it be cool if I got your number or
SHANNON: Yeah, sure.
LYNCH: Shit. Don't ski with my phone. It's in the locker with everyone else's stuff. Do you have a pen?
SHANNON: Don't ski with a pen.     Sorry.
LYNCH: Just shoot then. I've got a really good memory. I've only smoked pot like 500 times so I'm good.
LYNCH: Whew.   You! That's so like you!
DAN: But we gave you a hundred bucks and we've only gotten like 4 runs!
JASON: Why don't you write a letter?
LYNCH: (to Dan) Remember "429".
DAN: What?
LYNCH: Just remember "429". (to himself)
PARKER: (to Jason)
JASON: Sorry.
M: It's not about the money. They need to clear the mountain. We've got weather coming in. There's nothing I can do.
PARKER: What if we promise to run straight
DAN: Wicked fast.
JASON: Fine. But hurry.
DAN: We'll be wicked fast.    Like the wind!
LYNCH: Seriously. For a hundred bucks
DAN: I know right? They're supposed to
LYNCH: Wachusett still has night skiing.
PARKER: Good for you, Lynch.   You got her number!
PARKER: Nope.
RIFKIN: Early night, huh?
JASON: You're not gonna hear me complain.
M: Go talk to the boss. He's getting ready to leave.
JASON: I'm the best man! (under his breath) Shit.
RIFKIN: Ready to shut down?
JASON: There's three more on their way down. Wait for them, then it's all set.
PARKER: I'm not waiting til we get back to campus to eat. I'm starving.
DAN: Why didn't you have some pizza?
PARKER: You mean the cardboard with tomato sauce that you guys ate? That wasn't pizza. That was like,
LYNCH: There's a Papa Gino's on our way
PARKER: Sweet. I am gonna eat a whole real
A: pizza myself.
DAN: Check it out!
M: DAN (cont'd) We are so hitting that jump.
DAN: It's just wind, Parker.
LYNCH: Don't you mean, "baby"?
DAN: (to Lynch) Who invited you?
M: RIFKIN (cont'd) Asshole.
PARKER: Shit.   Do you hear that?
PARKER: Seriously. I'm gonna eat a whole pizza. (a few beats) I'm not even kidding.
RIFKIN: Cool. Last three just hit.   I'm
M: clear.
VOICE (O.C.): Clear up here.
DAN: Oh, come on.
PARKER: Bur!
LYNCH: (yelling to the sky)
DAN: (quickly)
DAN: "Get off me, you're crushing my
M: Marlboros".
LYNCH: I told you that?
DAN: What do you think the worst way to die would be?
LYNCH: Well yes and no. Because most people die of the smoke inhalation before any fire even hits them.
PARKER: I remember watching TV for like 3
LYNCH: But they say that when you jump
A: from that high up your heart stops before you hit the ground and you don't even feel it.
PARKER: OK, then Lynch. What is the worst
M: way to die?
LYNCH: (defensive) What?
PARKER: No, you have an answer for
PARKER: The what?
LYNCH: The Sarlaac pit. From Return of the Jedi? Hel-lo...being slowly digested over 1,000 years? Worst. Death. Ever.
DAN: (teasing) "I don't know why I never have a girlfriend, you guys!"
LYNCH: Shut-up.
DAN: Give it a minute.
DAN: (yelling)
LYNCH: Come on now! This is messed up.
DAN: Are they fucking kidding?
LYNCH: I kind of just shat in my pants a bit, I'm not gonna lie.
A: No they didn't. They couldn't have. I'm sure they have a system or something. There's probably security cameras on us right now.
M: DAN (cont'd)
PARKER: What if they don't start it again?
DAN: (angered out of panic) Will you stop?!
LYNCH: What did you say to the guy?
DAN: Me?   Nothing!
LYNCH: Well, clearly you pissed him off enough to do this.
DAN: I didn't do anything!   He knows we're still up here.
PARKER: Then why are the lights off, Dan? Is that part of their policy? Shut
DAN: They just lost power or something.
LYNCH: This is so messed up.
M: It's a power outage. They'll come up with a ladder if they have to.
PARKER: Don't yell at me.
DAN: I wasn't yelling at you but you need to relax. This stuff happens all the time. Can you imagine the law suit if they left everyone on this lift up here all night?
LYNCH: Free lift tickets.
PARKER: What other people on the lift? There was no one in front of us.
DAN: We won't be stuck here all night.
A: open again until Friday. (sobbing) We'll be stuck here all week.
M: PARKER (cont'd) We're gonna die up here.
LYNCH: We're not going to be stuck here. Parker. Parker, look at me. Even
PARKER: (hysterical)
DAN: Shh. I know you're scared. I'm scared, too. But any minute now they're gonna turn the power back on and we're all gonna be laughing about this.
LYNCH: That makes two of us.
M: Ew, Lynch if you pull out your junk in front of me I'm gonna puke.
LYNCH: Well, what do you want me to do?   I gotta go.
PARKER: Are you crazy! Put the bar down!!!
LYNCH: It's just the safety bar. It doesn't really do anything anyway.
PARKER: Well I like the safety bar and I like it down where it's supposed to be.
DAN: Then how are you going to piss?
PARKER: I can hold it.
PARKER: I can hold it.
M: I'm telling you, five minutes from now we'll all be laughing.
LYNCH: I'm pissing.
DAN: I hope they catch you and throw you out. I hope they ban you from the
LYNCH: Ban me from the mountain? You couldn't pay me to come back here. Make me sit up here in below zero weather forever while they get their damn Fisher Price lift working? Sorry. Not coming back. LYNCH (cont'd) There.   Much better.
DAN: (quietly) Put the safety bar down, Joe.
DAN: (louder) Put the bar down.
DAN: What did I tell you guys, huh?   WOO-
PARKER: Why isn't he stopping?
VOICE (O.C.): Steve.
STEVE: Go for Steve.
VOICE (O.S.): We got a problem here.
M: It's nothing but ice at the bottom of Wildcat so you're gonna have to cut over to the south hill and come around the side.
STEVE: That's gonna take me 20 minutes!
LYNCH: What is this asshole doing?
PARKER: No!   No!
PARKER: My face is burning.
PARKER: No it isn't.
M: It has to. DAN (cont'd) Anyone know what time it is?    I
LYNCH: Me neither. I use my phone. Hold on, let me just run back to the
PARKER: Stop.
LYNCH: Crunch Berries...
PARKER: Please, stop.
DAN: Dude, quit it.
A: LYNCH (cont'd) There's just something weird about eating purple horseshoes, am I right?
PARKER: Everyone went home.    They left us up here.
PARKER: (aside to Dan)
DAN: (aside to Parker) You're not gonna die, baby. I
A: won't let you die. OK? I promise I won't let you die.
M: (aside to Dan) I'm so scared.
DAN: (aside to Parker) It's alright. It's alright.
PARKER: Shayna.   My puppy.
DAN: Disneyworld in 8th grade.
LYNCH: Hmm...guess that leaves me. I'm gonna go with...oh yeah...these skis! Get it? MY SKIS. How ironic, huh?
A: See?    That's where smoking gets you.
PARKER: Shut-up.
DAN: I'm jumping. I'm gonna get help.
PARKER: No.    No, don't leave me up here.
DAN: Parker, I can do this. Even if I get hurt, as long as I can get to the bottom I....your skin is so red. You're getting frost bite.
LYNCH: You can't get frost bite that fast. It's only been- what, like...how long has it been? A few hours, tops?
PARKER: (quietly)
DAN: I'll get help. Lynch is here. He'll be with you.
LYNCH: Dan, it's a far drop.     I don't know.
M: (heated) Do you have a better idea? I'm telling you, I've totally jumped off of a lift before.
PARKER: No, no, no. Please don't jump down there, Dan. You'll get hurt.
LYNCH: How are you going to find your way in the dark?
DAN: I'll stick to the trail. I'll ride to the bottom.
M: Walker, no.
DAN: One.
PARKER: DAN!   DANNY? Oh my god!
LYNCH: Dan, say something.     Are you alright?
DAN (O.C.): My legs.    I broke my fucking legs.
LYNCH: Oh, shit.
PARKER: Can you move? Dan? (she starts to panic) Hold on. Hold on, baby.
PARKER: I gotta...I have to get to him.
DAN: Stay there. Don't get off the
PARKER (O.C.): How bad is it?
DAN: It's bad. It's really fucking bad. (starting to cry)
LYNCH: OK. Alright. You gotta stay
LYNCH: (to Dan below) Buddy, can you move at all?
LYNCH (O.C.): Alright, alright. Um...?
DAN: ...so much blood.
PARKER: Here...
M: PARKER (cont'd)
LYNCH: Here you go, Dan.     I'm throwing mine down.
DAN: What do I do with this?
LYNCH (O.C.): Tie it over your leg. Tie it off above wherever it's bleeding. Like a tourniquet thing.
DAN (O.C.): No! Don't you take off your coat!
M: You need it!
PARKER: No, I'll be OK. I can huddle next to Lynch. Please-
LYNCH (O.C.): Dan, buddy. You gotta let us throw something down so you can stop the bleeding.
DAN: I...I've got it.
PARKER: Are you sure.
LYNCH (O.C.): Are you sure you can't try and get
M: No, man.   I can't move.   I can't move.
LYNCH: Alright.   Hold on.
PARKER: You think you can pull yourself across that many chairs?
LYNCH: I can't even do a pull-up.
DAN (O.C.): You never even tried to do a pull up you asshole. You had your Mom write you a note to get out of climbing the rope in gym cause you're a pussy.
LYNCH: Even if I made it across to the
A: next chair...how many more would it take before I found one closer to the ground?
DAN (O.C.): Every lift pole has an emergency
M: ladder on it.
LYNCH: Shit, that's far. LYNCH (cont'd) Just.   Just give me a second.
PARKER: What if you fall, too?
LYNCH: Parker...if we just sit here, we're gonna freeze to death.
PARKER: Maybe...maybe in the morning someone else will come up here.
PARKER: We're right here, baby.
M: maybe I can jump to it.
LYNCH: It's funny. But I was never afraid of heights, until like...right now.
PARKER: What can I do to help?
A: LYNCH (cont'd) OK...OK...just give me a second.
PARKER: I think we should wait til morning. We can make it a few more hours.
M: (quietly) Us? Maybe. (then) But not him.
PARKER: Baby, is that you?
DAN (O.C.): What?
LYNCH: Shh!
DAN: Oh, motherfucker.
LYNCH: It's alright man. It's just a
M: That sounded like a fucking wolf.
LYNCH: Just relax. When's the last time you heard of a wolf attack in New England?
DAN: I read about one on-line somewhere last year. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
PARKER: It could be worse, right?
DAN (O.C.): How the hell...could this be worse?
LYNCH: Parker- coming through with the
A: tension breaker, look out! (to Dan) She's alright, Walker. Your girl is alright.
M: LYNCH (cont'd) OK...here we go.
LYNCH: Nothing.   Just be quiet.
DAN (O.C.): You can do this, Lynch.     You've got it.
LYNCH: Please stop talking.
LYNCH (O.C.): Hold on, down there. I think once I can stand on the back- I should
DAN (O.C.): There's a wolf down here.
PARKER: (gasps) Oh shit!
LYNCH: It's just a dog. That's all it is.
M: He won't be back.
PARKER: Are you keeping warm down there?
A: I'm not an expert but I think that's frost bite.
PARKER: What?
M: Look at me- is my face changing color anywhere?
PARKER: I don't..I can't see anything.    I
PARKER: But it itches now...
LYNCH: I know- but if you keep touching your face it's gonna rub off. LYNCH (cont'd) Just try and cover your face.    Try and stay warm.
LYNCH: I'm trying man, I'm trying.
PARKER: Careful.
M: Stop talking.
DAN (O.C.): Lynch.   I think the-
PARKER: Don't look down.
PARKER: Do you got it?
PARKER: What's wrong?
LYNCH: Please no.     Please no...
DAN (O.C.): Come on, Lynch! You had it!
PARKER: I got you.
LYNCH: Don't look down.
M: What?
LYNCH: Don't look down there, Parker.
DAN: Oh shit.   Oh shit.
DAN (O.C.): (crying)
DAN (O.C.): Don't let her look!
LYNCH: I should...try and...
PARKER: (emotionless) Why did you let him jump?
LYNCH: You can't be fucking serious.
LYNCH: He said he could do it. You didn't
A: try and stop him! (then) I can't believe this?! You're blaming me?
M: I'm not...I'm not blaming you.
LYNCH: You're his girlfriend! I didn't see you throwing yourself in front of him!
LYNCH: Oh, but he would have listened to me? I said it was a bad idea! I
PARKER: But you... You should have...
LYNCH: What?   Say it.
PARKER: I didn't say that.
PARKER: No, no, I-
LYNCH: You know what? If we hadn't spent the whole fucking day on the bunny slope watching you fall on your ass
M: we would have gotten some real runs in and we could have just gone home!
PARKER: I'm sorry.
PARKER: That's not fair!
LYNCH: And it's not fair that my best friend is DEAD!
PARKER: I'm sorry! I didn't mean it!     I'm just- I'm just-
LYNCH: -Fuck you.
LYNCH: 5022. 429-5022. I'm so gonna call that girl when we get home. And you know what? I'm gonna marry her. No messing around. I'm just gonna be like "Hey Shannon, it's me Joe from the chair lift. Will you marry me?" And then we're gonna get a house and have 2 kids and a dog named Steve.
PARKER: Who's gonna pay for the house.
LYNCH: She will.    Shannon's got a great
PARKER: What does she do.
PARKER: Orthodontists make a lot of money.
M: Yup.
PARKER: I bet you guys will be really happy.
PARKER: Who names their dog "Steve".
LYNCH: I will.
PARKER: Steve's a "people" name.
LYNCH: Says who?
PARKER: "Here, meet my cat Chris."
M: Shayna must be so hungry.
LYNCH: What kind of pizza should we get at Papa Gino's?
LYNCH: She won't starve to death and you're not going to die.
PARKER: No one else has a key to my place.
A: I would have had Shayna for a year this month. I got her a year ago for Christmas.
M: I know.   But you'll see her again.
PARKER: Dan and I were spending Christmas with my parents this year. We won't be there though. (then)
(MORE): PARKER(cont'd) It's kind of sad because then you know you have to wait another year for Christmas again. (then) It's the same routine every year. (then) I just want to see my Mom and Dad.
PARKER: Uhh...
A: PARKER (cont'd) Shhhh.
PARKER: What?
LYNCH: Your frost-bite.   It's getting...worse.
PARKER: Really?    How bad is it?
LYNCH: Don't.    It's bad.
A: You have some dark spots on your face, too.
LYNCH: They'll fix me, too then.   Just
M: don't touch it. LYNCH (cont'd)
PARKER: For what?
PARKER: No one's gonna look for me. I skip class all the time. By the time anyone notices I'm gone I'll be dead.
LYNCH: Can you please just think ONE positive thing? Please!
PARKER: Besides.   No one knows we're here.
LYNCH: (to the sky)
A: LYNCH (cont'd) Help me.
M: Are you sure you don't just wanna give it a few more hours? What if you're right? What if someone is going to come up here, even though they're not open today?
PARKER: I just wish I could stand up. Get out of this position for a minute.
LYNCH: If you want, you can stand on the chair and I can hold onto you.
PARKER: No.     I can't.
LYNCH: Well, if anything's gonna get you over your fear of heights, it's this.
M: LYNCH (cont'd) Parker wake up.
LYNCH: Shit, I thought you stopped breathing...
PARKER: What's wrong?
LYNCH: Nothing. LYNCH (cont'd) How about you help me up again and we try and get out of here?
PARKER: Yeah.
M: It was all that pizza talk.
LYNCH: I have no strength.
PARKER: Maybe later.
LYNCH: What? Like I'm gonna feel better if I wait a little longer? I should have done it last night while I still had some strength.
PARKER: There's more snow fall on the ground and it's all fresh. Maybe the jump won't be as bad now.
LYNCH: Even if it was a foot deeper- it
LYNCH: Nothing.   Let's sit and do nothing.
PARKER: How come you never have a girlfriend?
LYNCH: How am I supposed to answer that?
LYNCH: Maybe... maybe I shouldn't have been so quick to walk out. Maybe I needed to have a thicker skin and not be such a sensitive bitch, I don't know. Sometimes I think I was just insecure and maybe I
PARKER: You should call her. When you get home. You could tell her that.
PARKER: I should have done something.
LYNCH: There was nothing either of us could have done.
PARKER: He was the one. He was the boy I was gonna marry.
LYNCH: Funny story. First grade, we all get left there for the day by our mom's. You know, alone in real school for the first time without our folks around. And Dan... Dan was this sort of chubby kid when he was little...
