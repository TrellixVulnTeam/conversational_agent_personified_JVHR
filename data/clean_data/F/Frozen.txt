D: Lynch has the start of his own frost-bite on his ears and Slowly, Parker's eyes flutter and she awakens.
E: Her eyes search around as the realization that this was not all just a bad dream sinks in. She adjusts in her seat and feels something pull. She winces and looks down. Slowly the camera follows her stare down to reveal her bare hand, gripping the icy safety bar. She pulls.but her skin is stuck to the frozen metal. Beginning to panic, she jerks her hand hard, taking the bar up about half an inch with it.

M: ( to herself )
PARKER: ( to herself )
D: She raises the safety bar. There is no more time to think.
E: She is going to die one way or another. Slowly, Parker turns her body around towards the seat of the Holding on to the metal beams that make up the chair, she beings to lower herself, inch by inch, off of the side. CREEEEE-EEK! The lone metal bolt protests the movement and makes metallic threats to snap. Parker keeps lowering herself until her entire lower body is dangling below the chair. RRRRRUUUUUURRR!

PARKER: ( meekly )
R: She makes eye contact with the beast, who stares back at her, almost daring her to try and take it's treasure. Others from the pack look up, distracted briefly, but then go back to feeding. Parker and the pack leader lock eyes. Finally, the leader turns away from Parker, back to his food. Back to his family. Though her face is emotionless, Parker's eyes are swollen with tears as she continues on her way down the mountain She is free.
X: BEEP! A HONKING CAR races past with it's windshield wipers Narrowly missing being splattered, she collapses in the dirty There are no more cars to be seen. She is alone.
