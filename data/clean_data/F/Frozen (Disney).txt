ANNA: Hans follows closely behind her. GATES TO THE KINGDOM: Elsa runs out of the gates and down to the water's edge. The shoreline freezes under her feet. Anna calls to her from the gates.
HANS: Hans rushes to Anna's side. Elsa reaches the far shore. She doesn't look back. She just scrambles into the mountains.
ANNA: ( shocked ) Look.. The fjord.
HANS: ( shocked ) Look.. The fjord.
CROWD WALLAH: Snow? It's.snow.in July.

ANNA: ( fearless ) I like fast!
KRISTOFF: Whoa, whoa! Get your feet down.
ANNA: ( grossed out ) Ew. No, I was raised in a castle.
KRISTOFF: So tell me, what made the Queen go all ice-crazy?
ANNA: .Oh well, it was all my fault. I got engaged but then she freaked out because I'd only just met him, you know, that day. And she said she wouldn't bless the marriage
KRISTOFF: Wait. You got engaged to someone you just met?
ANNA: Yeah. Anyway, I got mad and so she got mad and then she tried to walk away, and I grabbed her glove
KRISTOFF: Hang on. You mean to tell me you got engaged to someone you just Yes. Pay attention. But the thing is she wore the gloves all the time, so I just thought, maybe she has a thing about dirt.
ANNA: Yes. Pay attention. But the thing is she wore the gloves all the time, so I just thought, maybe she has a thing about dirt.
KRISTOFF: Didn't your parents ever warn you about strangers?
ANNA: Yes, they did.. But Hans is not a Oh yeah? What's his last name?

ANNA: Probably John.
KRISTOFF: Eye color.
ANNA: Foot size.?
KRISTOFF: Foot size.?
ANNA: Foot size doesn't matter.
KRISTOFF: Have you had a meal with him yet? What if you hate the way he eats? What if you hate the way he picks his nose?
ANNA: Picks his nose?
KRISTOFF: And eats it.
ANNA: Excuse me, sir. He's a prince.
KRISTOFF: All men do it.
ANNA: Ew. Look it doesn't matter; it's true love.
KRISTOFF: Doesn't sound like true love.
ANNA: Are you some sort of love expert?
KRISTOFF: No. But I have friends who are.
ANNA: You have friends who are love experts.. I'm not buying it.
KRISTOFF: ( to Anna ) Stop talking.
ANNA: No, no, no. I'd like to meet these
KRISTOFF: I mean it. SHHH.
ANNA: What are they?
KRISTOFF: Flashes of white dart through the woods. Kristoff hops into the back of the sled, grabs a torch. Lights it.
ANNA: Wolves. What do we do?
KRISTOFF: I've got this. You just.don't fall off and don't get eaten.
ANNA: But I wanna help.
KRISTOFF: Why not?
ANNA: Why not?
KRISTOFF: Because I don't trust your Excuse me?!

KRISTOFF: Who marries a man she just met?
ANNA: It's true love!
KRISTOFF: ( shocked )
ANNA: Kristoff grabs onto a loose rope hanging from the back of the sled and holds on for dear life as he's dragged behind.
KRISTOFF: It's Kristoff!
AH!: Anna thinks fast, uses the torch to light a blanket on fire.
ANNA: Anna throws the flaming blanket right at him. He ducks. The blanket hits the wolves. They tumble off Kristoff.
KRISTOFF: You almost set me on fire!
ANNA: But I didn't.
KRISTOFF: You don't tell him what to do!
KRISTOFF: Of course I don't want to help her anymore. In fact, this whole thing has ruined me for helping anyone ever again.
ANNA: ( excited ) You are?! ( catching herself ) I mean, sure. I'll let you tag
ANNA: It's completely frozen.
KRISTOFF: It's completely frozen.
ANNA: .But it'll be fine. Elsa will thaw it.
KRISTOFF: Will she?
ANNA: ( uncertain ) .Yeah. Now come on. This way to the North Mountain?
KRISTOFF: More like this way.
ANNA: I never knew winter could be so
KRISTOFF: You're creepy.
ANNA: I don't want it!
KRISTOFF: Please don't drop me.
OLAF: Please don't drop me.
ANNA: Come on, it's just a head.
KRISTOFF: Come on, it's just a head.
ANNA: Olaf's body runs at Anna, arms waving.
ANNA: Ew, ew, the body!
OLAF: Wait, what am I looking at right now? Why are you hanging off the earth like a bat?
ANNA: ( sympathetic ) .Okay. Wait one second.
OLAF: Oooh! Thank you!

OLAF: Uh-huh. And who's the reindeer?
ANNA: Olaf looks from Kristoff to Sven, confused.
OLAF: Oh. They'reoh, okay.. Makes things easier for me.

OLAF: Yeah. Why?
KRISTOFF: ( bending the arm ) How does this work?
OLAF: Stop it, Sven. Trying to focus Yeah, why?
KRISTOFF: I'll tell you why. We need Elsa to bring back summer.
OLAF: ( shocked ) ( sinking into wistfulness ) Oh, I don't know why but I've always loved the idea of summer, and sun, and all things hot.
KRISTOFF: Really? I'm guessing you don't have much experience with heat.
OLAF: Nope. But sometimes I like to close my eyes and imagine what it'd be like when summer does come.
OLAF: BEES'LL BUZZ / KIDS'LL BLOW DANDELION FUZZ / AND I'LL BE DOING WHATEVER SNOW DOES IN SUMMER.
MAKES SENSE!: -Olaf tap dances with a gaggle of seagulls.
HAPPY SNOWMAN!: -Olaf runs with a checkered blanket that he spreads out. He relaxes and stares at the blue sky.
SUMMER!: I'm gonna tell him.
KRISTOFF: I'm gonna tell him.
ANNA: Don't you dare.
OLAF: IN SUMMER!
IN SUMMER!: Olaf sings the final note. We swing around him and return to: REALITY. He then straightens up and smiles.
ANNA: ( laughing ) I'm coming!
KRISTOFF: Somebody's got to tell him.
CITIZEN ONE: No. No. You've got the bark facing down. The bark needs to be face-up.
CITIZEN TWO: Bark down is drier.
CITIZEN ONE: Bark up.
CITIZEN TWO: Bark down.
CITIZEN ONE: Bark up.

GERDA: Arendelle is indebted to you, Your The castle is open. There's soup and hot glögg in the Great Hall.
HANS: The castle is open. There's soup and hot glögg in the Great Hall.
DUKE: Prince Hans, are we just expected to sit here and freeze while you give away all of Arendelle's tradable goods?
HANS: ( tall and confident ) Princess Anna has given her orders And that's another thing; has it dawned on you that your princess may be conspiring with a wicked sorceress to destroy us all?
DUKE: And that's another thing; has it dawned on you that your princess may be conspiring with a wicked sorceress to destroy us all?
HANS: Do not question the Princess. She left me in charge, and I will not hesitate to protect Arendelle from

HANS: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, boy. Easy. Easy.
CROWD: ( various ) Princess Anna's horse. What happened to her? Where is she?
HANS: .Princess Anna is in trouble. I need volunteers to go with me to find her!
DUKE: I volunteer two men, my Lord! Be prepared for anything, and should you encounter the Queen, you are to put an end to this winter. Do you understand?
KRISTOFF: So how exactly are you planning to stop this weather?
ANNA: ( confident ) Oh, I am gonna talk to my sister.
KRISTOFF: That's your plan? My ice business is riding on you talking to your
ANNA: Kristoff, so stunned by her casual plan, doesn't look where he's going and ends up with an ice-spike to the nose. He stops short, GULP, moves carefully around the spike.
KRISTOFF: So you're not at all afraid of her?
ANNA: Why would I be?
OLAF: ( oblivious ) Yeah. I bet Elsa's the nicest, gentlest, warmest person ever.
ANNA: What now?
KRISTOFF: .It's too steep. I've only got one rope, and you don't know how to climb mountains.
KRISTOFF: ( finding her ridiculous ) What are you doing?
ANNA: ( straining ) .I'm going to see my sister.
KRISTOFF: You're going to kill yourself.
KRISTOFF: Or there. How do you know Elsa even wants to see you?

OLAF: Hey, Sven? Not sure if this is going to solve the problem, but I found a staircase that leads exactly where you want it to go.
ANNA: Ha ha. Thank goodness. Catch!
ANNA: ( in awe ) Now that's ice. I might cry.
KRISTOFF: ( in awe ) Now that's ice. I might cry.
ANNA: Go ahead. I won't judge.
KRISTOFF: All right, take it easy. I gotcha.
OLAF: ( she doesn't ) Just knock.. ( she doesn't. To Kristoff ) Why isn't she knocking.? Do you think she knows how to knock?
ANNA: Ha. It opened. That's a first.
KRISTOFF: Last time I introduced her to a guy, she froze everything.

KRISTOFF: But, it's a palace made of ice. Ice is my life.
OLAF: Bye, Sven.

ELSA: ANNA ( O.S. )
NO!: ANNA ( O.S. )
ELSA: I CAN'T!
I CAN'T!: Elsa's fear, so strong, sucks the blizzard back into her and then it bursts out, unwittingly, like a sharp snowflake. Anna is STRUCK right in the heart. She grasps her chest in pain and stumbles back. She falls to her knees. Elsa gasps when she sees Anna. Just then, Olaf and Kristoff rush into the room to Anna's side.
KRISTOFF: Anna. Are you okay?
ANNA: I'm okay.. I'm fine.
ELSA: ( scared ) Who's this? Wait, it doesn't matter. You have to go.
ANNA: No, I know we can figure this out How? What power do you have to stop this winter? To stop me?
ELSA: ( desperate ) How? What power do you have to stop this winter? To stop me?
KRISTOFF: Anna, I think we should go.
ANNA: ( close to tears ) No. I'm not leaving without you, ( heartbroken but decisive ) Yes, you are.
ELSA: ( heartbroken but decisive ) Yes, you are.
ANNA: Stop. Put us down!
OLAF: ( to Marshmallow ) You are a lot stronger than I think you realize.
MARSHMALLOW: ( like a bouncer ) Go away!
ANNA: Watch out for my butt!
OLAF: Watch out for my butt!
ANNA: It is not nice to throw people!
KRISTOFF: Uh-oh. Now you made him mad!
OLAF: .I'll distract him. You guys go.
KRISTOFF: This way!
ANNA: I got him!
KRISTOFF: Whoa, stop!
ANNA: It's a hundred foot drop.
KRISTOFF: It's two hundred.
ANNA: He drops to his knees and starts digging a u-shape in the snow with a pick axe.
KRISTOFF: I'm digging a snow anchor.
ANNA: ( not trusting ) Okay. What if we fall?
KRISTOFF: There's twenty feet of fresh powder down there; it'll be like landing on a pillow.. Hopefully.
ANNA: Okay. You tell me when.
KRISTOFF: .I'm ready to go..
ANNA: .I'm ready to go..
KRISTOFF: ( pumped up ) .I was BORN ready! Yes!
ANNA: ( pumped up ) .I was BORN ready! Yes!
KRISTOFF: Calm down.
TREE!: Anna jumps and pulls Kristoff over the edge with her. They hang upside down over the cliff by the rope. The rope catches their fall.
KRISTOFF: Whoa! That happened.
OLAF: Ah. Ah. Man, am I out of shape.
NO!: Olaf jumps onto Marshmallow's leg trying to stop him, but not making much of a difference.
WHOA!: Olaf passes Anna and Kristoff.
ANNA: Hang in there, guys!
OLAF: Hang in there, guys!
ANNA: Wait, what?
KRISTOFF: Kristoff passes out and hangs like a rag doll.
ANNA: Marshmallow pulls them up. He roars and breathes snow all over them.
MARSHMALLOW: Don't come back!
ANNA: ( grossed out by his snow Ugh. We won't.
SLAM!: REVEAL: Anna opens her eyes to find herself buried up to her shoulders in the soft thick snow. She laughs.
OLAF: ( shaking the boots ) I can't feel my legs! I can't feel my legs!
KRISTOFF: Those are my legs.
OLAF: ( to Kristoff ) Ooh. Hey, do me a favor, grab my
KRISTOFF: Don't talk to him like that.
ANNA: ( impressed ) You okay?
KRISTOFF: You okay?
ANNA: Thank you.
KRISTOFF: ( in pain ) Ah! Ooh!
OLAF: I don't have a skull.. Or bones.
KRISTOFF: The awkwardness is killing him.
ANNA: ( shy ) Now what? ( then.panicking ) Now what?! Oh! What am I gonna do? She threw me out. I can't go back to Arendelle with the weather like this. And then there's your ice Hey, hey, don't worry about my ice ( noticing something ) Worry about your hair?!
KRISTOFF: Hey, hey, don't worry about my ice Worry about your hair?!
ANNA: What? I just fell off a cliff. You should see your hair.
KRISTOFF: No, yours is turning white.
ANNA: White? It's what?
KRISTOFF: It's because she struck you; isn't Does it look bad?
ANNA: Does it look bad?

OLAF: Look, Sven. The sky's awake.
KRISTOFF: Are you cold?
ANNA: .A little.
KRISTOFF: Wait. Come here.
ANNA: Oooh.. That's nice.
KRISTOFF: ( taking a deep breath ) So, about my friends.well, I say friends, they're more like family.. Anyway, when I was a kid, it was just me and Sven.until they took me in.
ANNA: ( moved ) They did?
KRISTOFF: ( nervous ramble ) Yeah. I don't want to scare you, they can be a little bit inappropriate.and loud.very loud.they're also stubborn at times, and a little overbearing. And heavy. Really, really heavy.
ANNA: Kristoff, they sound wonderful.
KRISTOFF: Okay then..
ANNA: ( to herself ) .They're rocks.
OLAF: ( realizing ) He's crazy. ( covertly, to Anna ) I'll distract them while you run. ( Loud and slow to a rock ) Hi, Sven's family! It's nice to meet you!

GRAND PABBIE: Bring her to me, Kristoff.
ANNA: What.? No.
KRISTOFF: So remove it, Grand Pabbie.
GRAND PABBIE: I can't. If it was her head, that would be easy. But only an act of true love can thaw a frozen heart.
ANNA: An act of true love?
BULDA: ( googley, to her hubby ) A true love's kiss, perhaps?

ANNA: ( weak, but desperate ) Hans, you have to kiss me.
HANS: Now. Here we go.
ANNA: Now. Here we go.
GERDA: We'll give you two some privacy.
HANS: What happened out there?
ANNA: Elsa struck me with her powers.
HANS: You said she'd never hurt you.
ANNA: I was wrong.
HANS: Hans carries her to a couch, sets her down.
ANNA: ( shivering more ) She froze my heart and only an act of true love can save me.
HANS: ( understanding ) A true love's kiss.
ANNA: Hans gets up, leaving her there.
HANS: As thirteenth in line in my own kingdom, I didn't stand a chance. I knew I'd have to marry into the throne somewhere
ANNA: What are you talking about?
HANS: ( putting out the candles ) As heir, Elsa was preferable, of course. But no one was getting anywhere with her. But you-
ANNA: You were so desperate for love you were willing to marry me, just like
HANS: You were so desperate for love you were willing to marry me, just like
ANNA: Hans. No, stop.
HANS: But then she doomed herself, and you were dumb enough to go after All that's left now is to kill Elsa and bring back summer.

HANS: ( chuckles ) All that's left now is to kill Elsa and bring back summer.

HANS: Oh, I already have.
ANNA: ( hoarse and weak ) Please, somebody help.
DUKE: It's getting colder by the minute. If we don't do something soon, we'll all freeze to death.
SPANISH DIGNITARY: Prince Hans.
HANS: Princess Anna is.dead.
VARIOUS DIGNITARIES: What.? No.. Mon dieu.
DUKE: What happened to her?
HANS: She was killed by Queen Elsa.
DUKE: Her own sister.
HANS: ( really putting it on ) At least we got to say our marriage vows.before she died in my arms.
DUKE: There can be no doubt now; Queen Elsa is a monster and we are all in grave danger.
SPANISH DIGNITARY: Prince Hans, Arendelle looks to
HANS: With a heavy heart, I charge Queen Elsa of Arendelle with treason and sentence her to death.
KRISTOFF: What is it, buddy?
ANNA: ( barely a whisper )
OLAF: Anna. Oh no.
ANNA: Olaf? Olaf. Get away from there.
OLAF: Whoa! So this is heat.. I love it. Ooh! But don't touch it!
ANNA: I was wrong about him. It wasn't true love.
OLAF: ( confused innocence ) Huh. But we ran all the way here?
ANNA: Please Olaf, you can't stay here; you'll melt.
OLAF: I am not leaving here until we find some other act of true love to save
ANNA: I don't even know what love is.
OLAF: ( confident ) That's okay, I do..
ANNA: .Kristoff loves me?
OLAF: Wow, you really don't know anything about love, do you?
ANNA: Olaf, you're melting.
OLAF: ( sweet and reassuring ) Some people are worth melting for.
ANNA: .They-they are?
OLAF: Wow, he's really moving fast. Huh.. I guess I was wrong. I guess Kristoff doesn't love you enough to leave you behind.
ANNA: Help me up, Olaf. Please.
OLAF: No, no, no, no, no. You need to stay by the fire and keep warm.
ANNA: I need to get to Kristoff.
OLAF: ( clueless ) ( realizing ) Oh, oh, oh, I know why.
OLAF: We're trapped.
OLAF: Slide, Anna. We made it!
KRISTOFF: Come on, buddy, faster.
ANNA: The wind lifts Olaf up and pulls him apart. He goes swirling off into the storm.
OLAF: Keep going, Anna!
ANNA: PAN TO:
KRISTOFF: Come on! Come on!
KRISTOFF: Anna.? Anna!
HANS: Elsa. You can't run from this!
ELSA: .Just take care of my sister.
HANS: Your sister? She returned from the mountain weak and cold. She said you froze her heart.
ELSA: What? No.
HANS: I tried to save her, but it was too late. Her skin was ice. Her hair turned white.
ANNA: ( a whisper )
KRISTOFF: Anna pushes on towards Kristoff. He runs top speed towards her. There's still a lot of fjord to cross, but Kristoff is giving it all he's got. He's going to make it. But then, Anna hears the sound of a sword being drawn from its scabbard. She turns and sees Hans, behind Elsa, as he raises his sword over his head.
ANNA: Anna looks back at Kristoff as he runs for her. She gives him a longing look, but then turns away from him and then. Using all of her remaining strength, as Hans brings his sword down, Anna throws herself in front of Elsa.
ELSA: Elsa rushes to Anna and touches her sister's frozen face.
OLAF: ( confused, sad )
ELSA: Wha-? Anna?
ANNA: Oh, Elsa.
ELSA: .You sacrificed yourself for me?
ANNA: ( weak ) .I love you.
OLAF: An act of true love will thaw a frozen heart.
ELSA: ( processing ) Love.will thaw. ( realizing ) Love.. Of course.
ANNA: Elsa lifts her arms, and the ground shakes and cracks. The ice and snow breaks away and rises high into the air. Beneath their feet the bow of a ship thaws. The entire fjord melts and other boats right themselves. The villagers come out to see the warmth returning. In one final wave, Elsa draws all of the snow into a giant snowflake in the sky, then waves it away, leaving only a warm summer day.

KAI: Arendelle thanks you, my Lord.
DUKE: This is unacceptable. I am innocent. I'm a victim of fear. I've been traumatized. Ow! My neck hurts. Is there a doctor I could.No? And I demand to see the Queen!
KAI: I have a message from the Queen. Arendelle will henceforth and forever no longer do business of any sort with Weaseltown.
DUKE: Weselton. It's Weselton!
ANNA: Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on!
KRISTOFF: Oops. Sorry.
ANNA: Oops. Sorry.
ANNA: ( stopping ) Okay. Okay. Here we are.
KRISTOFF: ( blown away ) Are you serious?
ANNA: Yes. And it's the latest model.
KRISTOFF: No. I can't accept this.
ANNA: You have to. No returns. No exchanges. Queen's orders. She's named you the official Arendelle Ice Master and Deliverer.
KRISTOFF: What? That's not a thing.
ANNA: Sure it is. And it even has a cup holder.. Do you like it?
KRISTOFF: Like it?
ANNA: We may.
ELSA: Are you ready?
ANNA: I like the open gates.
ELSA: We are never closing them again.
ANNA: What? Oh, Elsa, they're beautiful, but you know I don't ska
KRISTOFF: Look out. Reindeer coming through!
OLAF: That's it. Glide and pivot and glide and pivot.
