FEAST: Written by Revised Draft
CHIEF: This is it.
LANKY: Why did it have to be these caves.
COLLEGE BOY: Is something wrong?
LANKY: ( to College Boy ) Don't mind me, buddy. It's nothin'.
CHIEF: Let's get that first barrel.
COLLEGE BOY: What's with the awkward silence?
LANKY: You don't know?
CHIEF: Last winter, a man kidnapped a little girl and holed up in one of these caves. The cops had him pinned down and began to move in. This guy started shooting. but he wasn't aiming at the officers. .he was firing at something inside.
CHIEF: When the dust cleared, all they found was the little girl's shoes. With the feet still in 'em.
COLLEGE BOY: Lanky's on his knees, having grabbed him from behind. The two men mockingly laugh. College boy settles, embarrassed.
COLLEGE BOY: Hey, relax, I nearly shit myself when my boss pulled that one on me.
CHIEF: Hey, relax, I nearly shit myself when my boss pulled that one on me.
LANKY: I went well beyond nearly.
CHIEF: What was that?
COLLEGE BOY: Once was plenty, fellas.
CHIEF: As Chief moves forward, pulling out his pick-axe. Instantly, the cave is illuminated by a white floodlight. A group of GREENPEACE HIPPIE ACTIVISTS stand in the cave, CHAINED TOGETHER at the waist, startling the men into screams. MEAN GREEN ( 35, crooked glasses on a face that has launched a thousand craps ) barks into a MINI BULLHORN that hangs around her neck. She charges towards Chief.
MEAN GREEN: Stop it right there! You will not rape Mother Nature one more day!
CHIEF: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
HIPPIE GROUP: Mother Nature is not a whore/Don't dump in her any-more/Mother Nature is not a whore/Don't dump in her any-
CHIEF: Take it easy! We have a permit!
MEAN GREEN: ( handing a document ) And we have an injunction from the State to prevent any dumping in these caverns! This is virgin land! The aqueducts in these caves bring drinking water to our families, and its piping provides drainage for our farms that enrich this barren land! And it won't be tainted by waste of any kind! Not now! Not ever!
CHIEF: Fine, just back off!
CHIEF: Let's roll. Now-now-now!
CHIEF: How do you guys always know where we're going?
MEAN GREEN: ( with a smirk ) I'll tell ya next time! NOW MOVE IT!
MEAN GREEN: Score one for the green team!!!
BEARDED CAMERAMAN: Hey, man, that was righteous, but I need a shot with the sign up.
MEAN GREEN: We saved you today, ol' gal.
FUZZY: Oh, fuck!
MEAN GREEN: Sister, why do you always swing for the fences?
FUZZY: ( eyeing breach ) It's okay, but I. I think I see something in there. something shiny.
FUZZY: Oh my, it looks like diamonds!
MEAN GREEN: Give me the keys!!!
COACH: ( into pay phone ) They took my laptop with my PowerPoint presentation, my Blackberry, my cell. And to top it off, my car crapped out on the side of the road! I'm not making the conference and I have fourteen leads waiting for me. You gotta help me out here. I'm not kidding, I've have fourteen PRIMO leads waiting in the lobby of the Mariott. MARIOTT.
COACH: Son of a In with anger, out with love.
PARA: ( rolling away ) Shut up, fag.
BOZO: Shut up, fag.
EDGY CAT: ( to Bozo ) You're late!
BOZO: Don't dilly-dally then. Rack 'em!
BOTH: He talks with BARTENDER ( thinning hair, chiseled face, big earring ) who preps a drink.
BEER GUY: I mean, we'd been together for so long and then. bang! She drops me. Since then, it's been like a damn country song: she's gone, the car's repossessed, and a father figure made a pass at me. I'm not saying I ever had it. But I have definitely lost it. Now I haul this swill from armpit to armpit. I used to be a model for Christ's sake.
COACH: For what, may I ask?
BEER GUY: JC Penny. Spring wear.
COACH: You know, Chach, catching you at this low point is pure serendipity.
BEER GUY: Why is that?
COACH: Because I take the rubble of man and build superstars. In my briefcase here is a doorway to a self-help sensation. Give me a minute, because I'd like to buy you a drink and change your life forever. I have a brochure
BARTENDER: Save it. We don't deal in pamphlets 'round here. We stick to chemistry. And his drinks are on me.
BARTENDER: Was that the last keg?
BEER GUY: Yup, one keg of Beast for the basement, then the truck's dry.
BARTENDER: If you're stayin', move the truck, boss gets pissed about you using primo parking.
BEER GUY: Right, 'cause this joint's hopping.
NEWSCASTER: .the search for the missing protesters will be further complicated by the unstable conditions of these deep tunnels. Thus far, no sign of life has been detected, yet town officials are still optimistic.
NEWSCASTER: On a brighter note, or should I say a darker note, tomorrow's solar eclipse will bring out adults and children alike for a citywide fair of this metrological event. Stay tuned for our man on the street to take a closer look.
TRAMPY: He said there was no reason I had to stay a teller and that if I did good work and didn't mess up, I could become an assistant manager within three years. Can you believe that?
ADULTERER: That sounds great.
TRAMPY: That sounds like bullshit! I could be an assistant manager at The Lake Arrowhead Casino for knowing the fuckin' alphabet to G! I'll be twenty in three months.
ADULTERER: Just bring the whole bottle.
BELLE: If I could made that kind of money, I'd be in Hollywood next week.
TUFFY: 'Round here, there are ways.
EDGY CAT: That cash is gonna look much better in my pocket.
BOZO: ( re: mounted head ) Ya know, that deer only looks scared when you're in the room.
PARA: Excuse me, please.
EDGY CAT: Edgy looks to Para, distracted. Bozo quickly replaces the WHITE CUE BALL with one hidden in his waistline.
EDGY CAT: That's all she wrote.
EDGY CAT: Ohhh, now that's a rough one.
BOZO: Ohhh, now that's a rough one.
EDGY CAT: That's motherfuckin' impossible!
BOZO: ( crude Oriental accent ) Yoh anga will be yoh downfah. Go Goddamn it! NO!
EDGY CAT: Goddamn it! NO!
BOZO: Oh, come on. Crape Diem!
BOZO: Wake up! Check your pants!
GRANDPA: Get outta here.
BOZO: ( mocking ) What's that? Wha'cha say? Huh? ( to Grandma ) How much for the whole night, Grandma?
GRANDMA: You should be so lucky.
GRANDPA: ( re: his fists ) This one will stun ya, but this one will put ya to sleep.
BOZO: Bozo approaches OLD VET ( 52, long hair with bandanna, dirty beard ) HARLEY MOM, ( 45, bruiser, grizzled, tough as a saddle ) and DRUNK GUY at the bar. The sad trio toss peanut shells into three nearby tall, fat peanut barrels.
BOZO: You boys wanna try your luck at the
BOZO: Come on, I'll even throw with my left hand.
BOZO: Nothin' but a bunch of butts and pussies in here!
BELLE: Shit! Shit! Shit!
BARTENDER: Don't sweat it, just clean it up before he's done.
TUFFY: Keep these on, sweetheart.
CODY: Mommy, I want Nemo.
TUFFY: Mommy's working on it.
ADJACENT ROOM: Tuffy enters the room and takes off her blouse exposing her breasts. She pulls up her skirt and bends over a bedpost.
TUFFY: Let's get this over with.
BOSS MAN: I love a woman with enthusiasm.
BOZO: I got two hundred bucks says none of you can beat me!
BARTENDER: Hey! Get quiet or get out.
BOZO: C'mon guys
BOZO: Gimme some ACTION
HERO: Unless you people want to die you'll do what I say and you'll do it fast!
BARTENDER: You hold it right there, mister.
HERO: A storm of hell's coming down on this place any minute!
BARTENDER: Drop the canon!
HERO: I'm not armed now, just hear me out.
BARTENDER: I'll drop you and not even think about it!
HERO: Let me explain!
BARTENDER: You got one second to
HERO: Take a good look and listen to me! There's at least a four of these things out there!
HERO: I saw one of them tear up five men like they were corn on the cob! I don't know what they are. I don't know where they came from. All I do know is that these fuckers are fast, nasty, and hungry.
HERO: And they can fly. Not to mention they got claws like Ginsu knifes and more teeth than a chainsaw.
HERO: They're like goddamn blood hungry biker tattoos come to life. They're clocking us. Right now. And we have to lock this bar down! That means doors, windows, drains, and basements. We have to do it fast!
HERO: ( looks to Belle ) You! Get on that phone. Call the cops, National Guard, townies, whoever kicks ass and get 'em out here.
HERO: Any questions?
BARTENDER: Who are you?
HERO: I'm the hero
SECOND FLOOR: The Judge's blast blows a toe off Boss Man's RIGHT FOOT as he reaches climax with Tuffy. Boss Man HOLLERS.
MAIN BAR: Hero's right half is JERKED outside through the window. Blood sprays. Rapid chomping. CRASH! The double doors are kicked open, splintering the propped up chair. HEROINE ( Native American, rugged, ripped pants, wickedly hot ) rushes in, slams the doors shut and instinctively kicks up the RUST RED SHOTGUN. She flips it sideways and slides the metal weapon through the handles of the double doors, securing them. BAM! A massive HIT slams into the doors from the outside sending Heroine SLIDING across the floor. She SPRINGS to her feet and drives her weight into a table attempting to hoist it over the now open window.
HEROINE: HELP ME! SOMEBODY!
HEROINE: GET DOWN!
GET DOWN!: A BEAST nails the rising table, just missing Heroine's face. The table falls, pinning Heroine. JUNIOR BEAST enters. He's small and too fast to see well. He SWIPES the heads off Old Vet and Harley Mom. Bartender grabs The Judge, but he's SCRATCHED down the back. Junior Beast rips out the pay phone. Knocks over the TV. Yanks out half of Trampy's hair. Edgy Cat CHARGES the spastic monster with a stool.
EDGY CAT: I got you!
BOZO: Got 'cha!
HEROINE: Goddamn you!
ROADIE: You'll hit her!
SECOND FLOOR: The Judge's shotgun blast blows off another toe on Boss Man's RIGHT FOOT. He cries out in agony.
MAIN BAR: Heroine spins and buries a splintered piece of the broken chair into the ATTACKING MOMMA BEAST'S RIGHT EYE. The Beast SCREECHES and jerks back, dragging the rest of Hero outside. Heroine clutches the ring. Shrieks and flapping wings are heard outside. They dissipate. A moment of calm. Belle timidly holds the receiver of the busted pay phone. The other patrons emerge from under tables and other hiding spaces in various states of shock. Junior Beast has momentarily stopped moving. Bozo secures the lid with a nearby
BOZO: What the FUCK was that?
HEROINE: The jungle has a new king.

BOSS MAN: Is it clear?!
BARTENDER: BOSS MAN
BOSS MAN: Is there a gun pointing at you?
BARTENDER: Nah, I got the gun.
BOSS MAN: Alright goddamn it! Who shot me!? Who did it!?
BOSS MAN: My goddamn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?
BARTENDER: ( motioning to Heroine ) Her fella.
HEROINE: My husband.
BOSS MAN: Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
HEROINE: He's dead.
BOSS MAN: ( noticing destruction ) What the hell happened down here?!
BOZO: I didn't do it! It was fuckin' monsters, asshole!
BOSS MAN: Jesus Christ on the cross. someone make sense.
HEROINE: Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. One went through three of your patrons like So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
BOSS MAN: So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
HEROINE: He only shot you once.
BOSS MAN: ( re: Bartender ) He shot you the other time.
HEROINE: ( re: Bartender ) He shot you the other time.
BARTENDER: It was an accident. Sorry.
ADULTERER: Look at it!
BOSS MAN: My god. what is that?
TUFFY: My god. what is that?
HEROINE: That's one piece of four problems.
BOSS MAN: Please elaborate.
HEROINE: That head over there, that's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
BARTENDER: And the rest of 'em?
HEROINE: Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are still outside.
HEROINE: The next one is taller, but all out of proportion. Like a "teen beast."
HEROINE: I just took the eye out of the mother. She calculates, guiding the attacks.
HEROINE: If you are face to face with her, dive left.
ROADIE: And the last one is the
HEROINE: Father. The biggest, the strongest.
HEROINE: No sign of any weaknesses. No sign at all. He's an eating machine.
COACH: Of all the friggin' bars to be stuck That's not it. Four are here, but there's three others. which I can't account for.
HEROINE: That's not it. Four are here, but there's three others. which I can't account for.
HEROINE: We need to lock this place down. Is everyone in this room?
TUFFY: Oh my god! My son! My SON!
HEROINE: Tuffy is halfway up the stairs.
TUFFY: Cody! Mommy's coming! Mommy's coming!
HEROINE: Stop her!
BARTENDER: SECOND FLOOR Tuffy BURSTS through the door. Cody sits by the TV, unmoved.
SECOND FLOOR: Tuffy BURSTS through the door. Cody sits by the TV, unmoved.
CODY: Tuffy pulls Cody into her arms. Heroine and Bartender halt to guard the doorway. Heroine spots a SMALL PORTAL WINDOW.
TUFFY: Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is never gonna let you go!
HEROINE: Let's lock off this room.
TUFFY: ( moving to exit ) Never, ever, never. Never, ever, never, baby. I love you
TUFFY: Papa Beast LUNGES at Tuffy! Bartender SHOOTS, nailing Papa Beast. He hisses, but can't fit through the small window. Bartender aims again for a kill shot, but Papa Beast projectile vomits Cody's remains at Bartender. Papa Beast retracts out the portal window. Heroine SLAMS the wood shutters closed. Tuffy drops Cody's arms. Bug-eyed. She moves, zombie-like, to the staircase. Bartender follows, covered in Papa Beast's bile. Heroine locks the staircase door shut.
NOOOOOOOO!: Papa Beast LUNGES at Tuffy! Bartender SHOOTS, nailing Papa Beast. He hisses, but can't fit through the small window. Bartender aims again for a kill shot, but Papa Beast projectile vomits Cody's remains at Bartender. Papa Beast retracts out the portal window. Heroine SLAMS the wood shutters closed. Tuffy drops Cody's arms. Bug-eyed. She moves, zombie-like, to the staircase. Bartender follows, covered in Papa Beast's bile. Heroine locks the staircase door shut.
HEROINE: Damn it.
MAIN BAR: Beer Guy stares at the bile covered Bartender.
BEER GUY: Oh god.
COACH: ( to Tuffy ) Are you
HEROINE: Just let her be. please. Is that the only phone?
BARTENDER: The back phone is wrecked, too.
BELLE: This is really happening. I can't believe this is really happening.
GRANDPA: What'd you say?
GRANDMA: I didn't say anything.
PARA: Thank you, but I don't need any help
BELLE: What's this? A power magnet or No. It's nothing.
PARA: No. It's nothing.
BELLE: I didn't peg you for a con man.
PARA: Hey, it pays more than the couch.
BELLE: Lots of stuff around here does.
TRAMPY: The group looks over. Adulterer GRABS it.
TRAMPY: Back off!
ADULTERER: Back off!
BEER GUY: So, what now? Did those things leave?
BOZO: Why don't you go check it out?
BEER GUY: Fuck no.
ADULTERER: ( into cell phone ) I have a signal! I have Diane? Diane listen to me. get the kids and get in the basement. do it right now.

HEROINE: I wouldn't do that.
ADULTERER: Fuck you, bitch!
HEROINE: You can risk your life, but not mine! My daughter's no more than twenty miles from here waiting for me. I have just as much reason to leave this place as you do. But I also know that if they're here, then they're not there yet.
HEROINE: You understand me?
ADULTERER: Get the fuck off.
HEROINE: You understand me!?
ADULTERER: Now pull that tough boy shit again and I'll slice you from neck to nuts!
HEROINE: Now pull that tough boy shit again and I'll slice you from neck to nuts!
ADULTERER: You can't keep me here. This is bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is fucking BULLSHIT!
HEROINE: We can't risk letting them in.
ADULTERER: ( trembling, pissed )
BOZO: Yeah, you got it.
PARA: Yeah, you got it.
BELLE: See! This has to be isolated. That's a local broadcast.
NEWSCASTER: And now, we head to our man on the scene with a live look at tomorrow's event in Red Mountain.
HEROINE: My daughter's in Red Mountain.
NEWSCASTER: Can you hear us? Apparently we're having some technical difficulties.
HEROINE: Oh no.
NEWSCASTER: Oh, there we go!
REPORTER: That's right, the crowds are lining up early to witness tomorrow's meteorological phenomenon.
REPORTER: But always remember, don't look straight into the sun because a special filter is needed to avoid damaging your cornea.
REPORTER: And we're all looking forward to it tomorrow. Back to you.
NEWSCASTER: Thank you. And in other news.
ROADIE: That studio's local, we can call in.
BOSS MAN: I have a short wave radio upstairs.
TRAMPY: I'm calling them. it's ringing!
ROADIE: They'd have a police scanner.
TRAMPY: ( into cell ) Hello? Yes, we're at the United
NEWSCASTER: .it has been reported that the power outage
TRAMPY: Oh no! Oh fucking no!
HEROINE: Keep it together! I came from the east. That studio is south of here. For all we know, north and west are An associate of mine was coming in from the north, ain't heard a word from him in hours.
ROADIE: An associate of mine was coming in from the north, ain't heard a word from him in hours.
HEROINE: So, that leaves the west.
TUFFY: And Red Mountain. Your daughter.
HEROINE: BEER GUY
BEER GUY: This is goddamn depressing.
BOSS MAN: I've got some tools and extra planks in the kitchen, if we're on the same page here.
HEROINE: Let's work.
BARTENDER: We'll it ain't pretty.
BOSS MAN: But its got teeth.
BOZO: I think it's hungry again.
HEROINE: We have to kill it. Can you help?
BOSS MAN: Fire in the hole!
BOZO: I think we got
TUFFY: You're welcome.
TRAMPY: Jesus, it took all that? All those bullets? How can we possibly fight off the others?
HEROINE: Aim for their orifices. Eyes, ears and mouth. From what I've seen, it's their only weakness.
ROADIE: ( looking at the corpse ) Looks like they're soft on the inside like any other animal. Trick is to get in there and do the damage.
BELLE: Maybe we don't have to fight them.
BOZO: Right, let's just call 'em names.
COACH: Ladies and gentlemen, if I may have your attention.
COACH: We have to think outside the box here. We don't need to fight them, we need to scare them. Scare them right back. This is a species stand- off. We just need to show them we're not vulnerable. That we're formidable.
ADULTERER: I need a stick.
COACH: I need a stick.
COACH: Stand back.
COACH: Let's get that board down.
HEROINE: What are you doing?
COACH: Showing superiority. The scent of their dead may drive them away.
BEER GUY: I don't see them.
COACH: Come on. Come onnnnnn.
BELLE: Is there a call, or something?
BOZO: See that you monkey fucks! That's what you get when you mess with us! Woman or man, I don't give a fuck! Shit don't make me gay because you'll be sucking my dick!
PARA: P.O.V - THROUGH SMALL HOLES WHOOSH! Junior is swiped from the handmade pike.
BEER GUY: It's working. I think it's working.
COACH: You see? What I tell you?
ADULTERER: Good christ! They're cannibals!
COACH: Oh dear.
TRAMPY: Oh. my. god.
PARA: What are they doing now?
BOZO: Dude, they're humpin'!
HEROINE: Get back!
BOZO: Any more ideas, Animal Planet?
COACH: I-I-I was just being proactive.
BEER GUY: ( to Bozo ) Hey, you weren't helpin'!
BOZO: Go douche.
BARTENDER: What the hell now?
ADULTERER: We're stuck in here. That's what.
ROADIE: Hey, Miss?
ROADIE: If you don't mind me asking, how did you run into these things?
BOSS MAN: More importantly, how did you run away from these things?
HEROINE: Well, it all started about forty hours ago.
HEROINE: ( into phone ) So, how is staying with Grandma working out? Ya know, if you stare into her glasses, you can see what cards she is holding. But I didn't tell you that.
HEROINE: Mommy will pick you up tomorrow night, okay baby?
HEROINE: Hello? Charlie?
HERO: Holy mother of.
HEROINE: We barricaded ourselves in the cellar. Then it was just listening. We heard those things destroy an entire heard of livestock. They just kept coming. Closer and closer, consuming anything in the way. Slashing, feeding and licking the bones clean. Just when we said our prayers, the first ray of sun hit the house.
HEROINE: That first beam of sunlight drove 'em away. Somewhere. We called who we could and then decided to run for it. We didn't see a soul the whole drive out. When the tank went dry, we came upon a gas station to refill.
HERO: What's goin' on? The pumps are off.
TUBBS: There's nobody here
HEROINE: They've been here!
HERO: Turn on the pump!
HEROINE: We had no time. All we knew was the sun was dropping and we had to get enough fuel to make it through the night at 90 miles per hour.
HERO: Suck it down you metal bitch. Suck it down.
HEROINE: It happened fast.
HERO: Move it!
HERO: Get in the car, baby.
HEROINE: That's when I saw three others. just for a second.
HERO: Heroine fires up the car and tears out. Hero shoots and the station becomes a FIREBALL.
HEROINE: Close the roof!
HERO: Stripped Cousin Beast PUNCHES through the back window, reaching for them. Heroine jerks the wheel. The car 180's and the Beast sails off of the car into darkness. The Camaro tears down a tangent dirt road.
HERO: We made it!
HEROINE: It must have smelled the blood or something. We buried the body and got back on the main road when.
HERO: Heroine slams on the breaks. Grandpa Beast slides back, holding onto the grill.
HERO: Go! Go! Go!
HERO: Look out!
HEROINE: And that's how I ended up here.
BARTENDER: And the head?
HEROINE: I don't want to talk about that.
BARTENDER: So, your husband ditched you?
HEROINE: No. It was wild out there. No time to think. We just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.
BARTENDER: Well, justice is funny.
ROADIE: The three from the gas pump are over at the TV station? And you say there's four here, huh?
HEROINE: It appears so.
COACH: There's five here now, actually.
BOZO: Yeah, thanks for that.
PARA: ( to Heroine ) Hey, you lived on a farm, right?
HEROINE: Do you think they're gone? I haven't heard anything for a while, maybe they're gone.
ADULTERER: Do you think they're gone? I haven't heard anything for a while, maybe they're gone.
BELLE: Well, maybe they migrate?
HEROINE: As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack.
TRAMPY: How can you be so sure? You said yourself this started a day ago.
HEROINE: We learned fast.
BOZO: We? We learned fast? You are all that is left of we. No offense Pocohantas, but I think someone else should play "Chief" tonight. Someone that knows the lay of the land. Like me.
HEROINE: Para stares intently at the map. Adulterer moves over to the window that has shutters over it, peeking through a hole.
ADULTERER: Maybe these things are like locusts or something and only come out for a few days to feed. This could just be a part of their life cycle.
BELLE: Somebody's gotta know something about these things. This stuff just doesn't happen out of the blue.
BOZO: You gotta know somethin', you're I don't know a thing.
GRANDPA: You gotta know somethin', you're I don't know a thing.
BOZO: You gotta know somethin', you're I don't know a thing.
GRANDPA: I don't know a thing.
BOZO: Old people know stuff like this. Legends, tall tales, shit like that.
GRANDPA: Spill it!
BOZO: Spill it!
GRANDPA: I don't know anything!
BOZO: ( to Grandma ) How 'bout you? Or do I have to get Heavens no!
GRANDMA: Heavens no!
BOZO: Come on! Think back!
GRANDPA: If I throw a stick, will you go away?
BOZO: That's just horse shit.
HEROINE: Relax, they don't know anything.
BOZO: Yeah. allegedly.
PARA: ( to Heroine ) Hey, where was your farm?
HEROINE: ( points to map ) East. Why?
PARA: Did you ever slaughter? Slaughter Previous owners did, I think.
HEROINE: Previous owners did, I think.
COACH: What are you talking about?
PARA: Slaughterhouse run-off used to be drained into piping that ran through the mountains.
PARA: Earthquakes often cracked the piping and those flow lines were condemned, but never drained.
COACH: Cheese n' rice.
TRAMPY: I still don't get it.
PARA: What I am saying is. there's a distinct possibility that what we are up against is the result of steady stream of blood and tissue that has been leaking into the caves. And a day ago. something broke out.
BOZO: The first order of business is gettin' a big fuckin' tampon in that cave!
PARA: Nope, that wouldn't do it.
BARTENDER: I wouldn't do that.
BOZO: They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road, they'd be easy pickings.
HEROINE: ( to Adulterer ) I'm telling you, I don't see a thing
ADULTERER: I'm telling you, I don't see a thing
FROM OUTSIDE: P.O.V. - The eye sees its owner stumble back and fall to the floor holding his face.
INSIDE: Coach and Trampy move to help Adulterer.
FROM OUTSIDE: The eyeball fires into Papa's drooling mega-mouth. SLURP!
INSIDE: BASH! A Beast arm BURSTS through the side wall and SNAGS Coach's pants and boxers. He screams and lunges forward. He is BOTTOMLESS.
HEROINE: Everyone stay in the middle of the room! Off the walls! NOW!
HEROINE: Now, does everyone agree that they are still out there?
HEROINE: ( to Bozo ) 'Eh, Chief?
BOZO: Trampy holds Adulterer's wounded head.
TRAMPY: He's out cold.
BELLE: I know some first aid if we have a kit. Do we?
BOSS MAN: In the kitchen, under the sink.
HEROINE: No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.
TUFFY: ( to Coach ) There's some sweats in my bag behind the bar.
COACH: Coach heads to the bar. Roadie moves to the map near Para.
ROADIE: You're a clever man. Why do you take shit from him?
PARA: Yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
ROADIE: Your brother, huh?
PARA: Same parents?
ROADIE: Same parents?
PARA: Look man, I read books. He reads bumper stickers.
HEROINE: Alright, we need to stay alert and for everyone to take a role. You gotta have some guns or weapons around here.
BOSS MAN: I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs, I have locker with a sawed-off and some gardening tools. Maybe a few boxes of shells.
BARTENDER: I got shells, too. Box and a half tops. Machete behind the bar.
HEROINE: Okay, well that's something.
ROADIE: So we've got guns, kitchen knives, pipes, fire and sticks.
BEER GUY: I might be able to do something with the bottles.
GRANDPA: You're gonna need a whole lot more than that to get outta here alive.
BOZO: Oh, now you have something to say?
GRANDPA: You young'uns worry about weapons, I'm thinkin' 'bout strategy.
BOZO: Oh? And what's that?
GRANDPA: Sit still, look less like a meal.
BOZO: That's for bears and sharks, chunky
HEROINE: Alright, what else do we have? Can we somehow contact the outside world?
TRAMPY: I can't get anybody. I don't even know if I have a signal anymore.
BEER GUY: I have a CB in my truck, we could get some help out here.
BARTENDER: Who the hell would you call?
BEER GUY: Do you drive a short beer bus or something? You go out there, you get eaten. You stay in here, you get eaten. Anyone comes to help, they get eaten. Don't you see a pattern here, Spuds Makenzie?
BOZO: Do you drive a short beer bus or something? You go out there, you get eaten. You stay in here, you get eaten. Anyone comes to help, they get eaten. Don't you see a pattern here, Spuds Makenzie?
BEER GUY: Then I guess we should just give up.
BOZO: ( re: Trampy ) Believe me, I'd love to save the day and get some heroic snatch, but it's not in the cards, partner.
HEROINE: ( to Boss Man ) You said you had a short wave radio.
TRAMPY: BOSS MAN
BARTENDER: BOSS MAN
BOSS MAN: Go for it. It's by the far wall. Channel 9 is the emergency frequency.
HEROINE: Good. I'm heading to the basement for supplies. And you're going upstairs.
BOZO: Let's not get carried away.
HEROINE: Step up, Chief.
BOZO: So that's how it is? Fine! Shotgun, please.

BARTENDER: I'll wait by the door.
BOZO: Now who else is comin'?
GRANDPA: ( rising from his seat ) I'll go with ya.
BOZO: What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon.
BOZO: You! Zorba! You're coming too! Now gimme the keys.
HEROINE: No. You're locked in.
BOZO: Those two will be on the other side waiting for you. If you become food, I don't want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things.
HEROINE: Those two will be on the other side waiting for you. If you become food, I don't want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things.
BOZO: Don't get your hopes up.
HEROINE: Any volunteers to head into the basement with me?
TUFFY: I will.
BEER GUY: That's not a good idea.
BOSS MAN: With what happened upstairs
TUFFY: Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea. I'm ready.
HEROINE: Count me in.
ROADIE: Count me in.
BEER GUY: Me too.
BOZO: Alright you two, I don't want to hear any of this, "oh, I dropped the key, wrong key, ain't no key here." When I want out, I want out, ok?
BARTENDER: ( displaying keys ) They're right here.
COACH: We've got your back, bro.
BOZO: Just keep 'em handy, ladies.

MAIN BAR: Belle kneels next to the Boss Man.
BELLE: How are you holding up?
BOSS MAN: He pulls a bottle out of his pocket and hands it to her.
BELLE: What is this?
BOSS MAN: Morphine. My magic potion. I need a few drops.
BOSS MAN: You should try a little, it'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
BELLE: No other time than now, right?
BOSS MAN: Wait, before you do that, help me move. There's a small room off the kitchen where I can lay down.
BELLE: BOSS MAN
BOSS MAN: It's much safer in there. Trust me.
BASEMENT: The basement is dark, dingy and scattered with crap. Dried out ANIMAL CARCASSES hang from the ceiling on hooks. A WINDOW is open. Roadie slams it shut, eyeing the room, staring into the dark corners.
ROADIE: Stay on your toes everybody.
HEROINE: What's this?
ROADIE: You don't need to know what that is.
BEER GUY: There's a sawed-off shotgun in here.
COACH: Come on, bro.

BARTENDER: If he doesn't shut up.
COACH: He is human kabob.
BELLE: Doesn't your foot hurt?
BOSS MAN: I can't feel a thing, Hon.
BELLE: ( touching his crotch ) How 'bout now?
BOSS MAN: You're a bad girl, aren't you.
BELLE: BOSS MAN
BOSS MAN: The girl's got rhythm.
BOSS MAN: There it is.
BASEMENT: Roadie emerges with two crates. He dumps them on the floor.
ROADIE: This is all junk.
BEER GUY: This could come in handy.
HEROINE: Let's get everything upstairs.
HEROINE: I'm sorry.
TUFFY: Don't worry, I'm fine. Really.
HEROINE: I admire your strength.
TUFFY: Trust me, I plan on having a full breakdown when this is over, but for now, we all have to be strong, right?
HEROINE: This is my daughter, Charlie. She's all I'm after.
TUFFY: ( fighting back tears ) And I'm gonna need your strength, every bit of it.
HEROINE: And I'm gonna need your strength, every bit of it.
TUFFY: You have it.
HEROINE: Good. But still do me a favor.
TUFFY: Name it.
HEROINE: ( with a wink ) Don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
TUFFY: ( tiny smile )
SECOND FLOOR: Bozo turns and points the gun around the room. He sees the CB. It is like an intercom with a cable running outside. He drops the shotgun and fidgets with the CB knobs.
BOZO: Hello? Anyone there? We need help out here at the United Nations Tavern. Send guns, tanks, and all that shit.
BELLE: You wanna see, baby?
BOSS MAN: Hell yeah.
BELLE: How much you got?
BOSS MAN: How much I got, what?
BELLE: How much you got to see the show?
BOSS MAN: You don't understand, sweety. Daddy doesn't pay. Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
BELLE: BOSS MAN
BOSS MAN: You can't expect a man to buy a car without a test drive first, can you?
BELLE: Um, hmm
BOSS MAN: Now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.

MAIN BAR: The patrons track the wild CRASHING and HIGH-PITCHED SHRIEKING sounds of Papa Beast. He finally breaks out of the upstairs. Beer Guy and Roadie carry Boss Man into the room as Coach, Bartender, Heroine and the shaken Bozo creep down the stairs. Bozo slowly takes a seat in his brother's lap.
PARA: I thought that was it for a second What happened?
TRAMPY: What happened?
BOZO: I got Papa in the stones. He's neutered.
PARA: Whoa. good one.
ROADIE: That back room is sealed shut.

HEROINE: ( to Roadie ) You. What was that door downstairs?
BOSS MAN: Wait, wait, wait.
HEROINE: Don't bullshit me.
BARTENDER: It's a tunnel.
BARTENDER: It runs about a hundred yards and spits out on the backside of that hill down the way.
HEROINE: What's it for?
HEROINE: What's it for!?
BOSS MAN: Grass, man. I grow pot down there.
HEROINE: Does the tunnel spit out near a car?
BOSS MAN: It spits out behind the parking lot.
BOSS MAN: My truck is near, but it ain't nearly big enough to haul the whole lot.

ROADIE: What're you planning?
HEROINE: Three of us go. Two to defend, one to drive. We back up to the bar and then tear ass out of here.
BOSS MAN: Sounds sketchy.
HEROINE: Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die.
ROADIE: Give 'em to me, I'm going.
BARTENDER: You're trusting that con? He'll ditch us and never look back.
ROADIE: Fuck you too.

TRAMPY: How does it feel?
ADULTERER: You still have one left.
TRAMPY: You still have one left.
ADULTERER: Yes, the silver lining.
TRAMPY: It serves you right for cheating.
ADULTERER: Spare me.
TRAMPY: I figure it's karma. You wronged me and you wronged your wife, so this is karma biting you on the ass, or in your case. in the eye.
BOZO: Oh yeah?
TRAMPY: It could be worse, you could be dead. Then again, the climax is upon us.
BOZO: ( re: Trampy's hair ) Ya know, that's not a bad look on you. Kinda 1985, but not bad. I'd hook it up.
TRAMPY: I wouldn't fuck you for practice.
BOZO: Leave her alone.
ADULTERER: Leave her alone.
BOZO: Hey, cyclops. Let's have a quiet contest. starting now.

HEROINE: Neither. Just a farmer.
ROADIE: Oh yeah? Then how do you do it?
HEROINE: I just think about my husband and daughter. and the rest is easy.
HEROINE: WHIP! The curtain slides. It's a dried animal hide on a hook. They all sigh. Roadie unblocks the tiny door. Heroine scans the room.
ROADIE: This place is creepy in the daytime, too. Ready?
ROADIE: No. You?
COACH: No. You?
ROADIE: Of course not. I fight monsters all the time. On three.

HEROINE: Let's go.
COACH: Looks like a brothel for plants.
ROADIE: INT. BAR NIGHT Tuffy stands by a far wall, looking through the planks for movement. At the bar, Beer Guy makes MOLOTOV COCKTAILS. Bozo moves close, slaps Beer Guy's constructing hand.
BOZO: Ah-ah-ah! You're doing that all wrong!
BEER GUY: What do you know?
BOZO: I know you're doing it wrong.
BEER GUY: Prove it.
BOZO: Move aside, princess.
COACH: ( to Roadie ) You and I are similar. We both have accents. We both travel a lot. We both don't really have homes.
ROADIE: You should be quiet.
COACH: I am sorry, I ramble when I'm nervous.
HEROINE: Coach bites his lip, dying to say something.
COACH: It's just that this seems like the opportune time for someone to be horribly. offed.
ROADIE: What did I say?
COACH: Sorry. I'm done now.
BOZO: You don't want the rag touching booze, that way you can hold it and ensure it explodes when you throw it.
PARA: You sure? I thought the rag had to I'm sure.

PARA: BEER GUY
BEER GUY: You aren't nearly as dumb as you look, are you?
BOZO: Next time, look within. Stereotyping can be ugly and hurtful.
BOZO: Excuse me for being forward, but I'm curious about your dimensions.
ROADIE: Hold up. You hear something?
ROADIE: They're trying to burrow through the tunnel walls.
HEROINE: The scratching sound increases, now heard from the far end of the tunnel as well.
COACH: Like moles these things.
ROADIE: Roadie and Coach duck into the water, but Heroine is unable to avoid a thrust that knocks her back ten yards. Sister Beast #1 lands and turns, surveying her prey.

BOSS MAN: If you ask me, I'm gonna just lay right here, wait for sunrise, then walk on out of here.
HEROINE: That's your choice, but this is going to get a whole lot worse before it gets any better.
BOSS MAN: If all of you run for it, they won't care about lil ol' me. They like the food that moves.

HEROINE: As Heroine nears, Adulterer GRABS her arm.
ADULTERER: Stop! There's something wrong!
HEROINE: The group eyes Charlie, noticing Heroine's locket around her ankle, leading to a slightly ajar manhole cover. Suddenly, the sunlight starts to FADE. They look up the sun.
TUFFY: Oh god.
CHARLIE: The sunlight is fading. The manhole cover shakes, something is holding Charlie in place. Heroine lurches forward, but Adulterer holds her at bay.
ADULTERER: It's a trap!
