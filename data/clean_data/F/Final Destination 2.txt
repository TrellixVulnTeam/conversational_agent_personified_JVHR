KIMBERLY: Thanks, Dad. I'll call you.
KIMBERLY: Relax, Dad. It's Daytona, not Fix -A-flat? Road flares? Sunblock? Mace?
MR. BURROUGHS: ( playful ) Fix -A-flat? Road flares? Sunblock? Mace?
SHAINA: Just kidding, Mr. B. Don't worry, I'll keep an eye on her.
MR. BURROUGHS: ( sarcastic ) Oh, that makes me feel a lot
KIMBERLY: I know this is the first time we've been apart since. But everything's gonna be okay.
MR. BURROUGHS: I know, honey. I just
MR. BURROUGHS: Your mother would have been so proud of the way you've handled yourself through all of this.
KIMBERLY: ( softly ) I know, Dad.
MR. BURROUGHS: Buckle up!
UP AHEAD: Waiting in line, is Kimberly's red SUV.
KIMBERLY: Sorry! My fault! Want me to drive?
SHAINA: Want me to drive?
KIMBERLY: No, I'm good.
FRANKIE: Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?
DANO: Blo w me.
NISSAN SUV: Kimberly merging into traffic, NEARLY COLLIDES with a speeding yellow mini- bus carrying a high- school football team. Kimberly nervously jerks the wheel to the right, then realizing she's speeding towards the road construction barrels, she swerves back left, right behind the mini-bus at the last moment.
FOOTBALL PLAYERS: Pile up! Pile up! Pile up!
DANO: Christ, is this tribute to Princess Di Day or what? Jesus, all the crazies are out
KIMBERLY: ( unnerved ) Jesus, all the crazies are out
KIMBERLY: I told you no drugs in the car! My dad will freak!
DANO: ( laughs ) Calm down, Kimmy. It's not drugs, just weed.
FRANKIE: Yeah, you should have specified.
KIMBERLY: Hey, Dad. What's up?
KIMBERLY: You got it, Dad. I'll call you if I have a problem.
KIMBERLY: I will, Dad. Bye, luv you.
SHAINA: Um, Kimberly, your dad's not gonna call like every ten minutes is he?
DANO: ( hiding bag of weed in Shit! There's a cop behind us. Pull into the right lane now!
DANO: Look first, idiot!
SHAINA: Ignore 'em.
KIMBERLY: Dano, put that out NOW.
KAT: No, I'm stuck on Jury Duty so I won't be able to pitch the campaign. Let's get Silverstein to come in and.
KAT: What the hell? No, not you.
DANO: What's the cop doing? Did he see
KAT: Forget it, I'll call him myself.
THOMAS: I was supposed to be off today. How did I get screwed?
THOMAS: Copy that. Go on, sleep it off Drake.
FRANKIE: Relax, dude.
KIMBERLY: This trip better be wor th it. What's the guy- girl ratio again?
SHAINA: Get ready to smile, five guys per
KIMBERLY: I can live with thaaaa
FRANKIE: What's your problem, ya fuckin' crack baby?!
ISABELLA: .couldn't Keep your dick in check for another month? I knew this would happen when I got pregnant.
ISABELLA: What'd the doctor say? I have to come in to test for STDs? Goddamn
FRANKIE: Gas it around these idiots. We do have 1200 miles to go, you know.
INSIDE PACER: NORA KESNER, 35, and her son TIM, 15. Tim drums on the dashboard with two ten-ounce Naya bottles.
NORA: Tim, will you cut that out? I can't even hear myself think.
TIM: Damn, it really hurts, Mom.
NORA: I know, we'll be there soon.
FRANKIE: ( yells to driver ) Ever hear of the Ozone layer,
INSIDE CHEVETTE: RORY, 27, leans down to snort a line of coke off a Def Leppard CD case. S he looks up to see the Patrol Car is now behind him, he reflexively taps the brakes. Rory, eyes like saucers, sits rigidly transfixed at the wheel and nonchalantly wipes the CD clean on his pants.
THOMAS: Son of a bitch.
FRANKIE: A Trans Am. That shit went out with New Kids on the Block.
DANO: Yeah. Who does he think he is? Knight Rider?
FRANKIE: ( laughs; then )
DANO: You know, Hasselhoff before he did
KIMBERLY: What's the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to Daytona?
SHAINA: How does a nice mature fuck sound?
KIMBERLY: Hey, thanks for talking me into this trip. Ever since my mom. I dunno, I just feel like I'm starting to live again, you know?
NORA'S PACER: Nora sees the collisions ahead and slams on the brakes but the fallen Naya bottle prevents her from braking, and she SLAMS into the back of Kat's Expedition. The crash test dummy collision folds her Pacer and it EXPLODES into a huge fireball. EVAN, blinded by the smeared windshield, is too late. He swerves his Trans Am around the burning cars onto the wet grass. Kimberly sees the topless Trans Am slowly roll out of a huge WALL OF FIRE and coast to a stop. Evan comes up battered and bloody but still alive. He is trapped in his burning car, screaming and trying to release the seatbelt. Then, just when she thought it was over, a HUGE SEMI slides thro ugh the wall of fire, SMASHING the Trans Am out of the way, SPINNING it like a top. With the back sliding at 90 degrees it keeps on coming.
KIMBERLY'S POV: The semi's grill comes right at her!
FRANKIE: Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
DANO: Blow me. Yellow means go,
KIMBERLY: Oh my god, oh my god.
SHAINA: What is it? What are you?
KIMBERLY: There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die. All of us! I saw it!
FRANKIE: That's it. My turn to drive.
FRANKIE: Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
DANO: Blow me. Yellow means go, Kimmy.
KIMBERLY: Oh my God, oh my God.
SHAINA: What is it? What are you?
KIMBERLY: There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die, all of us, I saw it!
FRANKIE: That's it. My turn to drive.
SHAINA: Relax, you need to chill the fuck Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
KIMBERLY: Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
SHAINA: For Christ sakes girl, take a Taking you into an all request weekend with a classic from AC/DC.
DANO: What the hell are you doing?
DANO: Five-O's coming! Let's fucking roll, man!
FRANKIE: Jesus Christ! Here he comes! No! We'll all die if we do!
KIMBERLY: No! We'll all die if we do!
DANO: I told you she'd ruin everything!
SHAINA: Shut up, Dano, just stay cool. He's just stoned.
THOMAS: What's going on here?
KIMBERLY: ( incoherent, through There's going to be a pile up. Logs. Bodies everywhere. I saw it happen. It happened.
THOMAS: Miss, please step out of the
ISABELLA: Excuse me, but is there some way we could just drive around? I have a
ISABELLA: Hey hon, you got a mysterious caller on the answering machine from Planned Parenthood. What's going on?
INSIDE PACER: NORA watches the SUV, distressed.
NORA: What on Earth are they doing?
TIM: ( picking up two Naya Who am I, David Blane?
TIM: ( good-natured laughter ) Okay, quit it already.
KIMBERLY: ( trying to calm herself ) The radio played the same songs, the old lady's bag broke the exact same way it did in my premonition.
KIMBERLY: THAT's the truck that's going to kill everyone!
THOMAS: Alright miss, calm down. I just need this lane open. I need you to pull your vehicle onto the You're not listening to me! You have to do something!
KIMBERLY: You're not listening to me! You have to do something!
EVAN: Arrest this whack-job, wouldja? Some of us have lives, y'know. Why won't anyone listen to me?
KIMBERLY: Why won't anyone listen to me?
THOMAS: I'm not going to tell you to calm down again
ISABELLA: You couldn't keep your dick in check for a month?!
KAT: Great, now I'm really gonna be
THOMAS: L.A. 51, I need assistance and requesting paramedics for a major T.A. At
SHAINA: Kimberly, what's going on?
EVAN: I don't know what you want from me. Some crazy chic k blocks the highway with her car, said there'd be an accident and there was. Big deal. Even a broken watch is right twice a day.
KAT: Not to sound insensitive, but how much longer is this going to take?
EUGENE: If I don't get back to my classroom soon, the kids'll tear the room Those poor people. To think it would've been us if not for.
NORA: Those poor people. To think it would've been us if not for.
THOMAS: Tell me again how it started.
KIMBERLY: Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything. The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face.
THOMAS: Do you remember what triggered it The log truck.and everybody I guess. Everyone was driving like a maniac. And somehow I knew something horrible was going to happen, even before it did.
KIMBERLY: The log truck.and everybody I guess. Everyone was driving like a maniac. And somehow I knew something horrible was going to happen, even before it did.
THOMAS: You knew? You just mean a hunch, right? A bad vibe, maybe?
KIMBERLY: More than that. All the songs on the radio were about car crashes. Some kid's banging toy cars She was dialing her cell phone with her headset on. His car was leaking oil all over the road.
RORY: Hey, don't be knockin' the
KIMBERLY: Billboards about accidents. Kids yelling "pile up" for no reason. It all felt.just wrong. Just like.
THOMAS: Like what?
KIMBERLY: I know this sounds crazy.but you all heard about Flight 180, right? The kid who got off the plane?
THOMAS: You mean Alex Browning.
KIMBERLY: ( looking down ) .My Premonition was just like What are you talking about?
NORA: What are you talking about?
EUGENE: ( sarcastic )
NORA: Eugene sees Nora and Tim are hooked and speaks in scary campfire Everyone tenses up.
EUGENE: But this is where it starts to get freaky. So a month goes by, everything seems cool, but then the survivors start dying one boy one. 'Cause when your number's up, it's up, right? Some people said Death itself started coming for them, hunting down every last one, until they were all dead.
THOMAS: Well, not quite all of them. Clear Rivers checked herself into a padded room at Stoneybrook.
KIMBERLY: You do believe me, don't you? Officer Burke? Could I see you in
DETECTIVE SUBY: Officer Burke? Could I see you in
DETECTIVE SUBY: Tell me you didn't start up on that Flight 180 shit again. Did you?
THOMAS: Of course not. That would be irresponsible and unprofessional.
THOMAS: Look, you weren't there. It was weird. She knew that log truck was gonna cause an accident, she knew. Never mind.
DETECTIVE SUBY: I thought we we re finished with this bullshit. This is police work, not the psychic Hot Line.
KIMBER LY: But if I was never meant to pull over, then we all should have died in the pile up.
TIM: Which means Death could be coming for us.
DETECTIVE SUBY: Way to console the witnesses Burke.
DETECTIVE SUBY: You got 'em thinking Death is after them? Shit, they're the luckiest sons o' bitches on the planet. Get this guy Evan Shaeffer; Yesterday the kid wins the lotto and today some looney bitch b locks traffic and he avoids the worst pile up in years. I should be so damn
KAT: What if it's true? What if it's happening all over again?
NORA: You're all certifiable, you know that? I can't believe I've been listening to this crap. Come on, Tim, let's go outside.
TIM: Jeez, Mom, stop trippin'.
EUGENE: Look lady, we're just yankin' your Yeah, you're acting like we all just got the Diff'rent Strokes curse or something.
RORY: Yeah, you're acting like we all just got the Diff'rent Strokes curse or something.
NORA: What's wrong with you people?
MR. BURROUGHS: The sight of her fath er crying is enough to make Kimberly's own dam burst. She rushes over to him and buries her head in his chest, Thomas nods.
MR. BURROUGHS: Can I take her home?
DETECTIVE SUBY: Sure, you can all go.
KAT: First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now this nonsense.
RORY: Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya, but I've been over this X-Files shit since the sixth season.
KIMBERLY: I know it's crazy, but I'm really scared for the others. I've got this terrible feeling.
MR. BURROUGHS: What feeling?
KIMBERLY: That it's not over yet.
MR. BURROUGHS: Don 't worry. Everything will be fine, you'll see.
EVAN: the center of the staircase, directly in Evan's path - but Evan just misses it! He continues past MORE TOYS, nearing the top stair - The Airduct coughs, sending menus fluttering toward Evan's feet and he slips on them! He juggles the TV - but ultimately rights himself and continues down the hallway.
EVAN: Damn it!
EVAN: Come on, come on.
EVAN: Jesus Christ!
DETECTIVE SUBY: ( as if entranced ) Ooooh, I see it now. Your future. A transfer to another
THOMAS: You've made your point.
DETECTIVE SUBY: Good. Cause we just got some new info and I don't ne ed you getting freaky on me.
THOMAS: DETECTIVE SUBY Evan Shaeffer's dead. Guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought.
DETECTIVE SUBY: Evan Shaeffer's dead. Guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought.
KAT: No, Mom. Just turn on any station, they've been playing it all day. Yes, Mother. Channel four will do just fine. Here it is, gotta go.
MR. BURROUGHS: My Lord.
KIMBERLY: Don't. I have to see this.
RORY: Whoohoo! You see that shit? Right there? That's my fuckin' car right there! Oh God, that's dope.
MONTAGE: Of Kimberly, Nora, Tim, Eugene and Kat watching. They all take the news very hard as the FOOTAGE shows Evan's BODY being carried away by EMT workers. Eugene, however, shakes his head sadly but goes back to grading blue books.
NORA: Come on, Tim, lights out already.
TIM: You think. You think those guys were b.s.-ing us today or what?
NORA: You think. You think those guys were b.s.-ing us today or what?
TIM: You think. You think those guys were b.s.-ing us today or what?
NORA: Oh, please. Some people just need some serious rewiring, that's all.
NORA: Get some sleep.
NORA: Officer Burke, please?
KIMBERLY: It's okay, Dad. I'm not ten
MR. BURROUGHS: I'm sorry. I'm just so happy that you're safe.
KIMBERLY: I love you too, Dad. Goodnight.
MR. BURROUGHS: You know, after your mother died.
MR. BURROUGHS: There were so many times I didn't think I could last another day. I can't even tell you some of the
KIMBERLY: I used to have those feelings, too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength.and courage. And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was. And the bad thoughts would go away.
MR. BURROUGHS: ( choking up ) I don't know what I'd do if I lost
ANGLE ON: A computer printout in the shotgun seat: MAPQUEST directions to "Stoneybrook Hospital". As Kimberly drives through the gate, the mist almost seems to follow her inside.
PHYSICIAN: .at the request of the patient, you are to relinquish any sharp objects such as nail files, pencils, pens, safety pins, bobby pins, no matches, lighters, belts, belt buckles, earrings, chokers,
PHYSICIAN: .paper clips, watches, food, drinks, keys, poisons, pills and You have a cell phone on you?
PHYSICIAN: Then I think we're all done.
KIMBERLY: Wait. Is she.dangerous or No honey, but she expects you are.
PHYSICIAN: No honey, but she expects you are.
KIMBERLY: Jesus, how long are you going to keep her locked up this way?
PHYSICIAN: Depends on her, I guess. She's
KIMBERLY: Clear Rivers?
CLEAR: Kimberly Burroughs, eh? What do you want?
KIMBERLY: I thought.I thought you might be able to help me.
CLEAR: ( snicker ) Yeah, how?
KIMBERLY: I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up. .. I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
CLEAR: Nice work. Maybe if you're real lucky, you'll wind up in here with But I doubt you'll survive that
KIMBERLY: It's not just about me. Someone I saved died last night in a freak accident. What if the others are in danger, too?
CLEAR: Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up.
KIMBERLY: What list?
CLEAR: Death's list. The precise order you're going to die in.
CLEAR: The survivors of Flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash. That was Death's original design.
KIMBERLY: ( sudden realization ) Exact order? Then I'm next! I was meant to die with my friends, so I'm next! But you said someone else died last night. That means Death skipped past you. Someone must have ( off Kimberly's confusion ) Sometime yesterday you must have nearly died, but someone saved you.
CLEAR: But you said someone else died last night. That means Death skipped past you. Someone must have Sometime yesterday you must have nearly died, but someone saved you.
KIMBERLY: Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.
CLEAR: Congratufuckinglations. That makes you last to go. But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you. Always does.
KIMBERLY: That still doesn't make sense. You said you die in the same order you were originally meant to. But Evan Shaeffer died last in my premonition, not first.
CLEAR: It's moving backwards? Are you
KIMBERLY: Yes. In my premonition that Nora woman and her kid died first, then Evan and then.my friends.
CLEAR: Backwards.that's new.
CLEAR: That's good. Get all your tears out now, you'll need your eyes. For the signs.
KIMBERLY: If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon. When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your- face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it. It usually means the difference between life and The songs on the radio. But wait. I don't understand. Why is this even happening to me?
CLEAR: If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon. When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your- face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it. It usually means the difference between life and The songs on the radio. But wait. I don't understand. Why is this even happening to me?
KIMBERLY: ( to herself ) The songs on the radio. ( to Clear ) But wait. I don't understand. Why is this even happening to me?
CLEAR: That's what Alex used to ask himself right up until.
KIMBERLY: It's obvious you know what you're talking about. You beat it. You have to help us.
CLEAR: I didn't beat it; I hid from it. If you were smart you'd put a down payment on a burial plot and say goodbye to the dog, because what little life you have left is over as you know it. Don't make new friends, don't fall in love, and don't ever bother trying to save others. That's the worst killer of them all.
KIMBERLY: How can you say that? What kind of monster are you?
CLEAR: My family is dead. My friends are dead. And Alex.
CLEAR: And yes, that's the blade of a fucking ceiling fan in his head.
KIMBERLY: Know what? I think you're a coward. I think you hide out in here because you're too damn bitter and selfish to care about another
THOMAS: I tried calling last night but your Evan Shaeffer's dead.
KIMBERLY: Evan Shaeffer's dead.
THOMAS: I know. I've gotten calls all morning from everyone who was on the onramp. We're all meeting at my apartment tonight.
KIMBERLY: Then you believe all this?? That Death is working off a list?
THOMAS: I didn't. Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 Clean up? I don't.
KIMBERLY: Clean up? I don't.
KI MBERLY: Did you see that??
KIMBERLY: Pigeons. It's a sign! If Clear's right about the order, then Nora and Tim are going to be attacke d by I'm not following you
THOMAS: I'm not following you
KIMBERLY: They're next on the list. We have to find them.
ANGLE ON: Woman's N ike shoe on a down-moving escalator. Reveal Nora taking her son Tim to a dentist's office. The SHOELACE snags on a bolt of one of the steel side panels, untying it.
TIM: ( mischievous smile ) You think the tooth fairy's gonna come tonight? I'm thinkin' like fifteen bucks.
NORA: Nice try, kiddo.
TIM: Tim watches helplessly as Nora reaches down, tug ging at her sneaker, fear mounting. Tim also grabs her sneaker and yanks. Finally, the shoelace SNAPS, and Nora's free again.
TIM: You okay?
NORA: Sure hon. I'm fine. Let's shake it, we're late.
CONSTRUCTION CREW: Who apply industrial suction cups to large, thick sheets of PLATED
REVEAL: A photo of Eva, "Lotto Winner Killed By Ladder". Clear backs away, pausing to look at a group photo of the Survivors of Flight 180 just before take off. Smiling faces.
TIM: Not so much.
KIMBERLY: Turn around. The cleaning woman said they're at the dentist's. 14th and Main.
THOMAS: Hold on.
DR. LEES: Jesus. Every day at the same damn time. Now this'll only sting for a
DR. LEES: Open big. Wiiiiider.
ANGLE ON: NEEDLE heading toward his gumline BANG! Another pigeon takes a header into the reflection. Dr. Lees' hand jerks, nearly jabbing Tim's tongue. Tim squirms violently. Dr. Lees looks towards the window angrily.
DR. LEES: How the hell do they expect me to. Would you rather have the laughing gas?
DR. LEES: Jean? I need you in here.
DR. LEES: Open big. Wiiiiiider.
DR. LEES: Goddamn it already.
TIM: What are they doing here? And why are they yelling "pigeons"?
THOMAS: ( shaking his head ) Nora's not coming. She refuses to leave her son.
KIMBERLY: We have to tell her she's in I did. And right now, I don't think she cares.
THOMAS: ( sadly ) I did. And right now, I don't think she cares.
KIMBERLY: It's happening again. It's fucking
KIMBERLY: But we're all going to die. We can't stop it. It's just a matter of time. I'm so scared.
THOMAS: I am too. But you can use that fear. It'll sharpen your instincts. Keep you alert fro signs. It's the only way you'll be able to sav e the others.and me.
THOMAS: I know you didn't ask for any of this, Kimberly. But I don't think you have it in you to quit either.
KIMBERLY: Clear/Thomas. Thomas/Clear.
KIMBERLY: ( bitter ) The second one just dies. A 16 year old kid.
CLEAR: ( nods; a faint trace of I hope you're ready for this.
KIMBERLY: This is cheery.
THOMAS: Who is this guy, anyway?
CLEAR: A mortician. He seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us.
THOMAS: Should we knock?
CLEAR: ( looking ill ) He probably already knows we're
MORTICIAN: Hello, Clear. I've been keeping an eye out for you.
KIMBERLY: Oh my God. That's Evan Shaeffer.
MORTICIAN: Come to. Pick my brain?
MORTICIAN: ( to Kimberly ) Flesh and bone require 1,600 degrees for cremation. Gold, prosthetics and other metals must be removed before the final
CLEAR: ( not falling for this Just a simple question and we'll leave you alone with your new
MORTICIAN: Fire away.
CLEAR: How do you cheat Death once and for
MORTICIAN: Dead. But still fresh.
CLEAR: ( to the Mortician ) Look, we drove a long way to get here. So if you happen to know how to get this death monkey off our backs, it sure would be swell if you told us.
MORTICIAN: For what purpose? You seek a back way out of a room with but one door. You can't cheat Death; there
CLEAR: Bullshit. You told me Death has a distinct design, a blueprint, unalterable. But Alex and I cheated Death not once, but dozens of times. If the design is flawed, it can be beaten.
MORTICIAN: Such fire in you now. People are always most alive just before they die. Don't you think?
CLEAR: It can be beaten. And you know it.
MORTICIAN: Some say that there is a balance to everything. An equilibrium that is the connective tissue of the universe. They say that for every lif e there is a death, and for every death a life.
MORTICIAN: Solus novus anima licet evinco mortis; Only new life can defeat The list of life is forever set by the Divine Plan, the guiding hand that plots the course of the universe, down to its tiniest element s.
MORTICIAN: The list accounts for every life; from the dawn of man to the great apocalypse. But the introduction of life that was not meant to be, a soul forbidden to roam the earth, that could invalidate Death's list, shatter its very existence.
THOMAS: What the hell does that mean?
MORTICIAN: ( with finality ) To figure that out you'll have to follow the sign s.
MORTICIAN: But be warned. To disrupt the grand design is to unravel the tapestry of the universe. When you pull all the threads apart, you may find yourself hanging from them.
CLEAR: One last question. Why is Death working backwards this time?
MORTICIAN: ( shakes head; a sick Sorry, time's up.
THOMAS: New life defeats death? Follow the signs? Where the hell did you find that guy?
KIMBERLY: Yeah, I thought he was supposed to be helpful.
CLEAR: He was. If we can use your ability to see the signs, we can cheat Death long enough to figure out what "new life" means. I know, it worries me that I
CLEAR: What the fuck are you thinking?
SKATE RAT: I'm thinkin', suck my junk, bee
KIMBERLY: Comes to Thomas' arms - GASPING uncontrollably for breath. Terror- stricken. She begins hyperventilating.
THOMAS: What is it? What did you see?
CLEAR: You have to tell us now.
KIMBERLY: Clear shakes her head by the shoulders and barks commands like an angry drill sergeant.
CLEAR: You're strong. Do you hear me? You're a fucking warrior. Nothing scares you. In fact you happen to be the single most powerful woman on earth. Now what did you see?
KIMBERLY: I was driving a white van. It must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned. It was.horrible.
CLEAR: You were there?
KIMBERLY: I can practically taste the water in my throat. And something else. The smell of flowers.
CLEAR: ( confused ) Then it wasn't just a sign. It was a premonition?
THOMAS: Remember the onramp? There was a pregnant woman in a white delivery Holy shit. He said "only new life can defeat death." If she gives birth to a baby that was never meant to be born, a brand new soul that was never part of Death's Design.
CLEAR: Holy shit. He said "only new life can defeat death." If she gives birth to a baby that was never meant to be born, a brand new soul that was never part of Death's Design.
KIMBERLY: It throws the entire Death list out of whack. And a new list has to be rewritten f rom scratch. We all start over with a clean slate.
THOMAS: It sounds all well and good, but
CLEAR: Please, what else could it mean?
KIMBERLY: ( to Thomas ) So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.
CLEAR: So let's do it.
THOMAS: ( realization ) Shit, I don't have her number. She was never interviewed. She took off right after the accident.
KIMBERLY: How are we going to find her? There must be thousands of white vans in this state.
THOMAS: Hey, I'm a police officer,
KIMBERLY: Oh God.
THOMAS: I, uh.sorry.
KIMBERLY: I know, I know. We need my eyes.
CLEAR: It's all right. I'll take watch.
KIMBERLY: I'm okay. Just caught me by surprise. Put it back on.
CLEAR: Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
THOMAS: Taken care of.
THE MONITOR: Back, back, back until the Patrol Car slowly creeps backwards down the onramp.
KIMBERLY: There it is.
THOMAS: Got it.
CLEAR: I don't get it. Why is everything happening so fast? After Flight 180. A month went by before anyone died. And now five people are dead in less than a day.
THOMAS: Here we go. The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz. And Christ, there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these We need to hurry.
CLEAR: We need to hurry.
THOMAS: Let's lay this on her gently now. The stress alone could upset the
JORGE: I'm Officer Burke. I'm looking for an Isabella Cruz.
THOMAS: I'm Officer Burke. I'm looking for an Isabella Cruz.
JORGE: Shut up!!!
THOMAS: Are you Jorge Cruz?
JORGE: Maybe. What's this about?
THOMAS: May we come in?
JORGE: No. What's this about?
THE ROOM: As if a tornado had hit it. Wedding photos smashed and torn. Furniture over-turned.
THOMAS: ( a little stern ) It's about your wife, Isabella. Now is she here?
JORGE: No. I'm alone.
THOMAS: Look, pal, it's probably nothing. But I need to see
JORGE: Forget it. You'll need a warrant. I know, I'm a lawyer.
JORGE: Stop!!! You can't go in there!!!
YOUNG WOMAN: We never meant to hurt you Isa.You're not Isabella!
JORGE: I'm going to sue your ass!
KIMBERLY: Whose blood is that on the floor?
JORGE: Mine, you idiot. The dog went nuts this afternoon. Now arrest her!
KIMBERLY: Where's Isabella? Did you finally kill her you fucking wife beater?
JORGE: We had a fight. Some things got broken, the dog went crazy, she left me. Wouldn't say where she was going.
THOMAS: What was the fight about?
JORGE: Take a guess.
THOMAS: Does she have a cell phone? A way we can contact her?
JORGE: She did.
CLEAR: We're wasting time with this piece of shit. Let's just get to the
JORGE: Hey, when you find her, tell her the kid's half mine.

RORY: Just shut the fuck up and maybe you'll live.
CLEAR: You're not next, Nora. Nobody has to be next. That's the point. Last time, we didn't plan. We weren't organized. Now we can help each other. Think what would have happened if Kimberly had been able to warn you with the word pigeons.
CLEAR: Think what would have happened if Kimberly had been able to warn you with the word pigeons.
KIMBERLY: The point is, as long as you know what to beware of, you have a fighting chance. It can be beaten. If I call you and say subway, get to a high rise fast. A place where no subway could possibly go, get
RORY: Why the hell did I ever get on Route 18 in the first place? That's me, Mr. Dumb Fucking Luck.
CLEAR: Anyone read today's paper? The article on Evan Shaeffer?
CLEAR: The only reason he was on Route 18 was because he own the lottery and had to collect the winnings.
RORY: That lucky bastard.
CLEAR: What about the rest of you? Kimberly, you were driving to Daytona. Was Route 18 your first The new freeway was faster, but Route 18 was the way my mom used to take, so.
KIMBERLY: The new freeway was faster, but Route 18 was the way my mom used to take, so.
THOMAS: Route 18 is Drake's assignment, but he called in sick so I got. Drake's never sick.
KAT: I was my first day of jury duty.
EUGENE: Jury duty? That's randomly selected by social security Random, sure.
CLEAR: Random, sure.
EUGENE: What, you think Death planned for each of us to die in the pile up weeks ago? You're nuts.
RORY: Last July I dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident. They asked me what number means "good luck" in Jewish.
KAT: Eighteen. And it's "Hebrew".
RORY: Anyway, I guessed it right and won
RORY: The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18.
KIMBERLY: I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance.
THOMAS: ( realization ) Whoa, nine months?
KIMBERLY: Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
ISABELLA: Yes, I'd like to report a domestic squabble - my name? Isabella Cruz why, does it matter? I'm at the Super 8 motel. Yes, I own a white van. So what? Just get over here.
KIMBERLY: I'm sorry, Dad, we're having a hard time with Shaina's eulogy. I'll stay here at Virginia's tonight and see you tomorrow. I love you too.
CLEAR: Remember everyone, just because Kimberly's got the power doesn't mean we're not all capable of seeing signs to some extent.
RORY: It's like Forrest Gump.
CLEAR: Fuck. Should have seen that coming. The institution's made me
EUGENE: If Death has got such a hard-on for you, maybe you should get the hell away from us.
KIMBERLY: We need her. She's the only one who's dealt with this before, We're all going to have to open our eyes from now on. Look out for each other. Sleep in shifts. And we've got to safeproof this
CLEAR: We're all going to have to open our eyes from now on. Look out for each other. Sleep in shifts. And we've got to safeproof this

THOMAS: You think you should? It's not safe out there.
KAT: So? Nora's gotta bite it before me anyway, right?
KIMBERLY: Where are you going, Nora? You
NORA: Four years ago my husband died. Now Tim. There's nothing left for

NORA: If it's my time to go, to be in heaven with my family, then I can accept that.

EUGENE: Oh, watch it, you've caught your
MAN: Goodness gracious, darling, let me help you with.
KAT: You alright, Nora?
NORA: My God, someone please let me out of this
INTERCUT: The Elevator RISES! INSIDE THE ELEVATOR, Eugene watches Nora's head drop to floor level - then he pounds the Emergency Button - which SHORTS OUT! Nora's body lifts upwards from the force of the elevator floor! Nora's screams of terror and agony fill the air as the elevator repeatedly LURCHES UPWARDS. Kat gasps in horror to see this poor woman suspended above the floor. It lurches. And lurches. And lurches. The horror never ends. Clear comes from the stairwell and is shocked by the sight. She runs to the elevator doors, trying to pry them apart to no avail. All Kat can do, crying, is grab hold of Nora's flailing legs and try to pull her back down. The elevator lurches a final time. NORA'S HEADLESS BODY fall down into Kat's arms, knocking her to the floor. Kat freaks, skittering away as the body convulses.
EUGENE: .no escapes my ass. I control my fate. I die on my terms, hear me Reaper cockscuker?!

THOMAS: Guys, let's not panic. Isabella's
KIMBERLY: How do you know?
THOMAS: You said she was going to drive into a lake. How can she when she's in protective custody?
ISABELLA: What do you mean "grand theft auto?" This is insane.
STEVE: Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday mor ning.
ISABELLA: ( figures it out ) Jorge. When I get out of here I'm going to sue his cheating ass off.

STEVE: Damn, they always stick me with the Take my van!
ISABELLA: Take my van!
RORY: Here's what I don't get. For nine months, Death does all this shit to make sure I win these tickets and end up on Route 18 at exactly the right time for the pile up.
KAT: But why single me out? What am I in the great scheme of things? You'd think I stepped off Flight 180 or something. Fucking weird, You want weird?

KAT: I got that beat. So like, last May, I was supposed to stay at this cheesy bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania. There was a major gas leak no one knew about and all the guests suffocated during the Yeah, so what happened?
RORY: Yeah, so what happened?
KAT: I never mad it. The Greyhound bus I was on splattered some chick all over the road and we had to stop.

KAT: Yeah. How did you know?

CLEAR: What about you, Kimberly? Did you anyone from Flight- ?
EUGENE: Are you okay?
KIMBERLY: A little over a year ago, my mother and I went to the mall. I was supposed to meet her outside, but I got caught up watching some news report about some kid who committed suicide. I kept thinking, "How can you strangle yourself in a bathtub?" That's retarded.
KIMBERLY: It felt wrong. And yet. There were gunshots outside and I Some kids tried to jack her car. She fought them off - she was a fighter - and they killed her.
KIMBERLY: After the funeral I had this overwhelming feeling that it should have been me. I figured that's how everyone must feel. But I guess I was right.
INTERCUT BRIAN: The tractor is safely off the road next to a wood pile. Brian grabs a cord and starts up the whoodchipper.
CLEAR: It's all starting to come together. When Alex got us off Flight 180, it didn't just change our lives. It
EUGENE: I'm not sure I understand.
CLEAR: Being alive after our time caused an outward ripple - a rift in Death's design.
EUGENE: So if you never got off the plane, none of us would be ali ve in the first place.
CLEAR: That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all ­
BRIAN: The wood chipper roar s loudly. Suddenly, some forgotten stray chunk SHOOTS from the spout The airborne chunk of WOOD CRACKS the White Van's windshield. Steve veers out of control. Kat sees the White Van ahead swerving into HER LANE. She quickly jerks the wheel to the right. Kat's LEFT FRONT TIRE BLOWS! It sends rubber flying and the entire SUV pulls hard to the left, spinning her out of control into the oncoming lane of traffic - toward the White Van! Isabella SCREAMS! Steve jerks the wheel to the left! The White Van has a close near miss with the Expedition, and goes off the road toward a LAKE!
STEVE: Hang on!
STEVE: We're okay, we're okay.
ISABELLA: Please. It's not going to wait.
STEVE: I've got to stop and help those
ISABELLA: Do you want to deliver this baby?
THE EXPEDITION: The dust settles in the silent car. The only sound is a QUIET, WET WHEEZE. Clear, dazed, looks around carefully, avoiding the METAL SPIKE that skewers the vehicle. Rory holds his trembling hand before his eyes as if amazed to see it. Kimberly shakes her hair, spilling glass onto the floor. Kat tries to open the door, but it won't budge.
KAT: Not my time. Amazing.
THOMAS: Is everybody alright?
KAT: He can't breathe! He can't
CLEAR: Oh my god, Eugene!?
THOMAS: Stop it, don't move him!
KIMBERLY: He can't breathe damn it. I think his lung's collapsed!
CLEAR: Someone call for help!
KAT: I can't move my fucking leg! Please get me out of here before it
RORY: Watch it, dude!
KIMBERLY: Help us, we need help over here!
BRIAN: ( to Kat, reassuringly ) I don't smell any gas. And none's dripping, either.
KAT: Stop that! I still need this foot, thank you.
CLEAR: Be careful with that, check the gages on the regulator and be mindful of overdoses. Oh, watch for potholes and puddles.
CLEAR: Look, I made him a promise
PARAMEDIC: Sorry. There's no room.
THOMAS: Get that over here! Move move
RESCUE WORKER: Excuse me, hot soup coming through.
CLEAR: One more thing. Watch out for power lines.
CLEAR: We have to contact Isabella now!
THOMAS: Where's the cell phone Clear gave I dunno. I think I gave it to Eugene back at your place.
RORY: I dunno. I think I gave it to Eugene back at your place.
THOMAS: Damn it. We have to call the Greenwood Police Station and warn You doing alright in there?
KIMBERLY: You doing alright in there?
KAT: My legs are starting to cramp up. And God, why am I so thirsty? Does anyone have any Fiji? Christ, you wanna give me a heads up next time, pal?
KAT: Christ, you wanna give me a heads up next time, pal?

KAT: Damn, can't you be quieter with that thing?
RESCUE WORKER: ( dripping scorn ) Sure, I'll just set it to the "quiet" mode.
MEANWHILE: The gasoline purposefully trickles down corrugated steel, through pipes, closer and closer to the Expedition. At one point, the gas even disappears into a hole in the ground, only to resurface twenty feet closer to the site.
KIMBERLY: Looks confused to watch Rory climb between the fence wires and drift the Dead Oak Tree into the field. Thomas runs down the hill toward Rescue Workers pull off a large chunk of door. KA-CHUNK! Kat
THOMAS: We gotta go now. Isabella's in What about that?
KIMBERLY: What about that?
CLEAR: ( calls over to Kat ) How you doing in there, hero?
KAT: ( re: spike behind head ) I guess it could be worse.
THOMAS: So let's go.Where the hell is
KIMBERLY: Is put on alert by a fresh BREEZE. Her attention is caught by the WINDOW of an emergency vehicle. IN THE REFLECTION, Kimberly sees a man sitting on the Expedition, but when she spins ar ound, there's no one there. KA-CHUNG! The door comes off the Expedition, finally freeing Kat! Everyone applauds!
KIMBERLY: Mr. Gibbons, applauding with everyone else, chooses that very moment to sit on the bumper.
CLEAR: Get back!
MR. GIBBONS: I didn't mean to do it - I didn't
KIMBERLY: ( to herself ) It wasn't his turn. And it's not my turn.
KIMBERLY: Give me the keys to your truck. Anything you want. Anything. I wish I knew. I didn't.
MR. GIBBONS: ( hysterical ) Anything you want. Anything. I wish I knew. I didn't.
THOMAS: ( buckling up ) Hurry up. There's no time. She's about to give birth.
CLEAR: What are you doing? You're going to kill us!
KIMBERLY: No. If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me. But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive. I'm last on Death's list.
CLEAR: Are you crazy? What makes you think you'd survive?
KIMBERLY: What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
CLEAR: ( considering ) Six duds in a row.
KIMBERLY: And when it was Rory's turn to die, and Thomas was in the way?
THOMAS: That branch fell and saved my life. You're right, Death's maintaining the order.
KIMBERLY: Let's pray that Isabella's still

ANESTHESIOLOGIST: Perfectly still now.
FLINCH!: The NEEDLE SINKS IN - a NURSE GASPS. Did something go wrong?
ANESTHESIOLOGIST: ( tears welling ) Now could someone please find the open window and fucking close it?
KIMBERLY: This makes no sense. Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake. Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested?
CLEAR: I don't think so. Alex's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we
THOMAS: Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can.
CLEAR: If only Alex and I had done that with the others, Alex might still
THOMAS: Um, Kimberly? This is a neighborhood. You may wanna slow it down.
KIMBERLY: Don't worry. Nothing can happen to I wasn't worried about us.
THOMAS: I wasn't worried about us.
UNKNOWN POV: A NURSE hovers over us in a hospital, WRESTLING us down by the look of things. There is SCREAMING all around. The image comes at us so fast, we see only the briefest glimpse of the NAMETAG on her uniform:
KALARJIAN: THOMAS ( O.S. ) Kimberly! Slow down!
CLEAR: Slow down! We're. What did you see? What am I looking for?
CLEAR: ( eyes darting ) What did you see? What am I looking for?
KIMBERLY: No, it's not here. This one was different. More like the pile up and the van going into the lake. It wasn't just a sign, I was there.
CLEAR: ( confused ) Another premonition?
KIMBERLY: Yes. I was in a hospital. There was screaming. A nurse was choking me. I couldn't tell wh at she looked like, but the name tag was right in my face. Kalarjian.
THOMAS: I think a nurse named Kalarjian is going to choke Isabella to death!
KIMBERLY: I think a nurse named Kalarjian is going to choke Isabella to death!
NURSE: Sorry. Can you feel that in your
NURSE: Quite complaining. I got burnt babies in the Children's Ward braver than you.
NURSE: Don't bother. You won't be talking for at least a month. Think you can handle that, Jabberjaw?
NURSE: Don't worry. Everyone learns to love me once they get used to my sense of humor, okay?
KIMBERLY: Shouldn't we pull over?
THOMAS: No time. Keep going. I wouldn't know how to explain any of this
KIMBERLY: Oh come on.

ANCHOR MAN: Good advice, Sue. And stay in school. Up next, Johnny Showers has the weather.
ORDERLY: Jeez, it's freezing in here.

CLEAR: A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene.
THOMAS: Don't sweat it. It's over.
CLEAR: She had the baby?
KIMBERLY: New life defeats death. We've done it. Death has to rewrite the list. We're safe.
UNKOWN POV: Looking up a the EEG machine. Flatlined!
THOMAS: Are you okay? You just face I know how it feels to be dead.
KIMBERLY: I know how it feels to be dead.
CLEAR: What did you see?
KIMBERLY: I was dead. And came back to life. An EEG machine. Where's Eugene?
THOMAS: But it's over. Isabella's baby was the key. You saw her die and everything, right?
KIMBERLY: I don't.what if I made a mistake?
THOMAS: Impossible. She was on the onramp.
PREVIOUSLY UNSEEN: Moment of the pile-up premonition. A WHITE VAN in fr ont of Kimberly suddenly slams on its brakes and pulls onto the shoulder. Kimberly screams, swerving around the van just in time to avoid an BACK TO:
KIMBERLY: I'm not sure. I don't think Isabella was ever destined to die in the pile -up.
THOMAS: Then what's the premonition of the lake supposed to mean?
CLEAR: Can you remember anything about it?
POV DRIVER: Grease-covered hands reach out toward a steering wheel of a white van speeding out of control TOWARD A LAKE! The van crashes through a railing and PLUNGES into the water. In moments, the van fills with water, the driver inside trapped. Drowning. Horrible. And on the rearview mirror, six floral scented AIR-FRESHNERS.
KIMBERLY: .the Same hands from the van.
CLEAR: It's you Kimberly. The premonitions are about you.
KIMBERLY: No! It can't be.
CLEAR: ( suddenly remembering ) I have to save Eugene!
CLEAR: Eugene? Are you in there?
EUGENE'S ROOM: Eugene strains to hear through the thick door.
KIMBERLY: Oh no.
ORDERLY: ( to Clear ) Thanks hon, the Henzels are going crazy for this thing.
BOOM!!!: Clear's body is obscenely hurled END OVER END towards the CAMERA, heading straight for Kimberly and Thomas! Thomas throws himself and Kimberly around the corner to prevent being crushed by Clear's lifeless body!
KIMBERLY: Nurse Kalarjian.
DR. KALARJIAN: Doctor Kalarjian. Excuse me,
KIMBERLY: Oh my God. That's it. The lake. The EEG machine. Nurse Kalarjian.
THOMAS: Just then, an AMBULANCE SKIDS up to the nearest entrance. PARAMEDICS jump out and run towards the blast site.
KIMBERLY: You can't cheat destiny. I know what I have to do to save us. I have to die.
THOMAS: That's crazy. You can't give up now. We can still fight this
AMBULANCE: A red stripe down the side, but the hood is completely white. Six floral scented air-fresheners hang from the rearview. The 'van' from her vision! And it's running!
KIMBERLY: I have to do this.
EMT: What the fuck?!
UNDERWATER: Thomas swims into the dark, murky water. Deeper and deeper, he g ets to the ambulance and tries to open the door. Stuck. He withdraws his baton and BANGS on the glass - nothing! He tries coming up for air, but his pants snag on the jagged metal of the twisted bumper. He squirms frantically. And as his exhausted body loses consciousness, everything
KIMBERLY'S POV: Looking up at Dr. Kalarjian, all she can see is part of a woman's face and a partial nametage reading "Kalarjian". It would appear as if she's choking Kimberly, but An EEG MONITOR turns from a flatline to a steady heartbeat, the same POV as the premonition.
NURSE: She's back!
DR. KALARJIAN: Five CC's of narcodon. I want her stabilized and prepped for ICU.
THOMAS: Unconscious, CPR being performed on him by the EMT ( who's now soaking wet ). Thomas doesn't respond. An INTERN opens an eyelid, points a flashlight at his eyes. Shakes his head, nothing. The sopping wet EMT goes back to performing CPR. Finally, Thomas coughs up water, chokes, gasps for air, then BOLTS
THOMAS: He turns to see Kimberly reaching out for him. Immeasurably relieved, he takes her hand and allows himself to be eased back down to the platform. Kimberly's eyes fill with tears.
KIMBERLY: ( whispering ) Welcome back. We did it. For I know. I can feel it too.
THOMAS: I know. I can feel it too.
ANGLE ON: Shish -Kabob entering a mouth.
REVEAL: Kimberly taking a bite, relishing the taste and calmly pulling the metal skewer from her mouth.
KIMBERLY: My God, this is delicious. I can't believe I used to be a vegan.
THOMAS: What's wrong with a platonic Platonic my ass. That's for ugly For God's sake, leave him alone, Yeah, don't make me cite you for Oh please. I'm not hurting anyone. Besides, if you can beat Death,

KIMBERLY: Three short glorious weeks away.
MRS. GIBBONS: Sounds wonderful. I wish I were going myself.
MR. GIBBONS: ( to Mr. Burroughs ) You may want to think twice about letting her live in the village, Bob. Our eldest daughter moved there and came back with piercings all over her face. ( looks grave ) Among other places.
BRIAN: Dad, you had the spatula last, Sure, here.
MR. GIBBONS: Sure, here.
KIMBERLY: Brian looks like he's having fun.
MR. GIBBONS: Sure does. Owes it to that friend of yours, in a way.
KIMBERLY: How's that?
MR. GIBBONS: Well, Brian was nearly hit by an ambulance the day.but your friend Rory pulled him back at the last
MRS. GIBBONS: You never told me that, Peter. Boy, that was lucky.
