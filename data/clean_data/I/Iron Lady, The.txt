MARGARET: How much is the milk?
MARGARET: Too much. Much too much butter.
DENIS: I like butter.
MARGARET: Milk's gone up.
DENIS: Good grief! We'll have to economise. I suppose we could always sell the car. Or take in paying guests!
MARGARET: ( to DENIS ) Eat your egg.
JUNE: Goodness! There you are.
MARGARET: MARGARET eats her egg.
JUNE: I don't understand how it happened, how could she possibly have got out? It's very very important -
POLICE GUARD: MARGARET slips away.
JUNE: Beautiful day. Oh, you've made a start. Carol's coming soon, I'll get some bags. Anything you want to go to Mark, I'll bring up a suitcase for it.
MARGARET: No no no no. The grey.
MARGARET: Distant footsteps-
MARGARET: Oh, I haven't had a chance to look at that yet, dear.
JUNE: JUNE hesitates, leaves the newspaper resting on the bed as she heads off with the suit on a hanger.
DENIS: DENIS smiles as he stands in the bathroom doorway, soaping his face with shaving cream- He hums to himself as he resumes shaving until-
MARGARET: Blot it.Blot it..
JUNE: Sorry ?
DENIS: Now look what you've done. Are they to keep the loonies out or you in?
MARGARET: Wear your scarf. There's a chill out there.
SUSIE: Good morning Lady Thatcher. Are you alright ? How are you feeling ?
MARGARET: I'm fine, thank you Susie.
SUSIE: I've just been reading about the Yes. Frightful.

SUSIE: I think they said Rogers and
MARGARET: Silly man.
ALFRED: Did someone cover the butter?
MARGARET: I'll go.
BEATRICE: Leave it.
ALFRED: Not just big business but small businesses, like mine.
BEATRICE: ( passing/hushed
CUPS!: MARGARET sinks a little, taking the tray, and glances back at ALFRED just visible on a stage.
ALFRED: We on this island are strong. We're self-reliant. Sometimes we're plain bloody minded.
ALFRED OOV: ( close to ) Open it then.
MARGARET: ( looking up ) I've got a place at Oxford.
ALFRED: Don't let me down Margaret.
MARGARET: ( calling out ) ( shakes head ) My hands are still damp.
BEATRICE: ( shakes head ) My hands are still damp.
BEATRICE: ( passing/hushed
CUPS!: PRESENT - MARGARET stirs again, blinking awake. DENIS sits by the window. He is bent over a pair of spectacles, wrapping wire around one of the arms with a pair of pliers. Other items of clothing of his are on Margaret's couch.
DENIS: ( without taking his They're talking about you again.
MARGARET: What time is it?
DENIS: Sun's not quite over the yard arm. Time for tea.
MARGARET: What have you got on your head?
DENIS: Found it in the cupboard and thought bugger it, it's Friday, why not fancy dress?
MARGARET: You look ridiculous.
DENIS: Bosslady no like?
MARGARET: ( as if to a bad dog ) No, Denis, Bosslady no like.
MARGARET: ( without looking )
DENIS VO: Oh, rumbled!
CAROL OOV: Can I suggest you remove the sticker from the back of your car.
CAROL OOV: Hello June, any news? I've brought every bag I could find.
CAROL: Hello Ma. Bloody taxi driver. Wouldn't take my card. I said don't have a sticker saying you take Visa and then insist on cash. Can you believe it? I was rummaging around the bottom of my bag. He didn't get a tip.
MARGARET: I didn't know that you were dropping by today, dear.
CAROL: ( Dumping her stuff all over the place ) Yes, you said yesterday.You wanted to make a start on Dad's things. The cupboards ? Then I can help you dress.
MARGARET: Coming for dinner tonight.
CAROL: Coming for dinner tonight.
MARGARET: Of course. We're having halibut.
CAROL: Oh God. Isn't it terrible?
DENIS: It'll be fine. Come on, get your head down, it's ten to three, for God's sake.
MARGARET: ( standing up ) We must release a statement, offering our condolences.
CAROL: I'm sure they've already-
MARGARET: We must never, ever, ever give in to terrorists.
CAROL: Now ma, are we going long or just below the knee tonight?
MARGARET: Oh, below the knee I should think.
CAROL: I hear you went out today.You mustn't go out on your own Mummy. We've talked about that.
MARGARET: There was no milk.
CAROL: Call Robert he'll get it for you if June's not up-
MARGARET: I am not for the knackers yet.
CAROL: No one is saying that.
MARGARET: If I can't go out to buy a pint of milk then what is the world coming to. Really Carol, please don't fuss about it. You've always been like this, fuss fuss fuss. You must find something better to do with your time. It's most unattractive in a woman. When I was your age the last thing I wanted to do was fuss around my Four down, 9 letters.
DENIS: Four down, 9 letters.
MARGARET: DENIS writes, pleased. CAROL looks up, with quiet bemusement-
CAROL: MARGARET deflects, pointing to a necklace in CAROL's CAROL slips them onto MARGARET'S neck and fastens them.
MARGARET: Pearls. I'll wear the pearls.
CAROL: It's nearly all familiar faces, William, Michael and his lovely
MARGARET: CAROL smiles, clearly reassured-
CAROL: And then there's Peter, James R and James T and that very nice man-
DISTANT LAUGHTER: - we met last year.
MARGARET: - we met last year.
CAROL: - we met last year.

MARGARET: Oh, yes, to his core. And Mayor of And a grocer as well!
PORTLY HOST: And a grocer as well!

HOSTESS: And did you help, err, in Oh, yes. It was a family business.
MARGARET: Oh, yes. It was a family business.
MARGARET: That and a degree from Oxford.
MARGARET: ( hushed aside to
WAITER ): The MURMUR of conversation all around-
MARGARET: What I do think is that a man should be encouraged to stand on his own two feet. Yes we help people of course we help people. But for those that can do, they must just get up and do. And if something's wrong, they shouldn't just whine about it, they should get in there and DO something about it, change things. With all due respect, Miss Roberts, what may have served in Can serve very well for the people of Dartford too.
PORTLY HOST: With all due respect, Miss Roberts, what may have served in Can serve very well for the people of Dartford too.
MARGARET: Can serve very well for the people of Dartford too.

MARGARET: A man might call it fiscal responsibility, a woman might call it good housekeeping.
MALE GUEST: I'm not sure a home economics lesson is quite what the Dartford constituents need. They see industry being nationalized, the unions on the up, the pound on the slide.whoever can sort that lot out - he's my man.
MARGARET: Or woman?
HOSTESS: Ladies shall we ?
PORTLY HOST: Miss Roberts, do join the ladies.
MICHAEL: So, Margaret, how would you have dealt with this if you'd been Prime Minister?
MARGARET: The bombings, mummy. Today?
CAROL: The bombings, mummy. Today?
MARGARET: No, uhm, yes - we have always lived alongside evil. But it has never been so patient, so avid for carnage, so eager to carry innocents with it into oblivion.
MALE GUEST: So, would you -
MARGARET: Western civilization must root out this evil, wherever it hides, or she risks defeat at the hands of global terror in a nuclear age. The Prime Minister gave a very good statement I thought.
PETER: The Prime Minister gave a very good statement I thought.
MARGARET: Yes. Clever man. Quite a smoothie.
MARGARET: You don't mind if I sit down.
FEMALE GUEST: I heard you speak at conference in 1984 in Brighton just after the IRA bombed the Grand Hotel. You were remarkable. I hope you appreciate what an inspiration you have been for women like myself.
MARGARET: It used to be about trying to do something. Now its about trying to be someone.
FEMALE GUEST: Well anyway, I.thank you.
MARGARET: Good night to you.
CAROL: OK.hold on to me.that's right.
MARGARET: Can you do the clasp, I can't quite -

RADIO ANNOUNCER: Twenty-four-year-old Miss Margaret Roberts lost her bid to win a seat in Parliament today, but she has put new life into the Dartford Conservative Association. Winning candidate Mr Dodds had better watch out, this bright young woman is on his tail.
DENIS: MARGARET almost smiles. Then sinks once more into misery.
MARGARET: Hang on.Hang on.Hang on.
DENIS: Hang on.Hang on.Hang on.
MARGARET: Not splendidly enough.
DENIS: Ah I see. Self pity.
MARGARET: What game?
DENIS: You are a grocer's daughter-
MARGARET: ( fiercely ) -And proud of being-
DENIS: - in their eyes. A single grocer's daughter. But if you were to become the wife of a moderately successful businessman-
MARGARET: Yes. Yes!
DENIS: What ?
MARGARET: I love you so much but.I will never be one of those women Denis - who stays silent and pretty on the arm of her husband. Or remote and alone in the kitchen doing the washing up for that matter.
DENIS: ( trying to retain the We'll get a help for that. No - one's life must matter, Denis. Beyond the cooking and the cleaning and the children, one's life must mean more than that - I cannot die washing up a tea cup. I mean it Denis, say you That's why I want to marry you, my

MARGARET: You look happy.
DENIS: Yes, I do, don't I? You're drinking too much.
MARGARET: They grow up so fast.
MARGARET: He turns and rushes towards the camera, whooshing past Without breaking step, suddenly, he's in the room, running past Margaret, still cheering and whooping. MARGARET's hand, just skimming MARK's golden curls. As he moves on, MARGARET's curiosity caught following him out and down the corridor of Chester Square, seeing the Mark and Carol disappear round a corner.

SPEAKER: The Right Honourable Lady the Secretary of State for Education.
MARGARET: The right honourable gentleman knows that we have no choice but to shut down the schools!
SHADOW MINISTER: Methinks the Right Honourable lady doth screech to much. If she wants us to take her seriously she must learn to calm down! If the right honorable gentleman could perhaps attend more closely to WHAT I am saying, rather than HOW I am saying it, he may receive a valuable education in spite of
MARGARET: If the right honorable gentleman could perhaps attend more closely to WHAT I am saying, rather than HOW I am saying it, he may receive a valuable education in spite of
SHADOW MINISTER: Why has this Conservative government failed? Why has it forced so many in the public sector into taking strike action to save their own jobs?
HEATH: So these power cuts will continue unless we can reach a compromise.
MINISTER 1: Hear hear, Prime Minister.
HEATH: - the fact of the matter is, it's absolutely crucial that we are seen by the public to be acting as conciliators and not aggressors. Yes, Education Secretary.
MARGARET: All eyes TURN on her again, hearing the reservation in her voice.
HEATH: Be patient. They'll come back on in a minute.
ALFRED: He meant it as an insult but to me it's a compliment. That's why he couldn't beat us, and that's why Hitler can't beat us.
CAROL: I swear, it's all gone completely out of my head. My driving instructor thinks I should pass but I feel as if I've hardly had any lessons. Ridiculous isn't it? Maybe third time lucky.
MARGARET: Right. The only thing you should remember is that everyone else is either reckless or inept. And often both.
CAROL: Move over. Move to your right a little bit.
MARGARET: Move over. Move to your right a little bit.
CAROL: But if I move to the right aren't I on the wrong side of the road?
MARGARET: Well he's in the way!
CAROL: Well he's in the way!
MARGARET: To the right. Move to the right!
CAROL: Hey, look at me, driving!
CAROL: Thanks Ma, that was terrific! I really feel I've got a handle on it now.
MARGARET: Have you been trying to make breakfast? For Goodness sake,
DENIS: I can boil a bloody egg.
CAROL: Mummy took me for a test drive - We went absolutely everywhere. All over the place -
MARGARET: ( sudden/cutting in ) I've decided. I'm going to run.
DENIS: What for?
MARGARET: I'm going to run for Leader of the
CAROL: Silly me!
DENIS: ( calling after ) Good luck!
MARGARET: What's she on about?
DENIS: It's her driving test this
MARGARET: Oh, right. Of course.
DENIS: Are you saying you want to be Prime Minister?
MARGARET: ( with false patience ) What I'm saying is that someone must force the point, say the unsayable. None of these men have the guts.
DENIS: The Prime Minister has been very loyal to you, MT.
MARGARET: But he's weak, and he's weakened the party. One must know when to You're shaking.
DENIS: I can do it!
MARGARET: Goodness me! What is the matter with everyone this morning?
DENIS: I've told you what the matter is. The business is a bit rocky at the moment and the Doctor thinks I need a rest.
MARGARET: And do you need a rest?
DENIS: ( sotto voce ) You're insufferable, Margaret, do you know that?
MARGARET: Denis, you married someone who is committed to public service, you knew that. And it is my duty -
DENIS: ( interrupts ) Don't call it duty. It's ambition which has got you this far. Ambition. And the rest of us, me, the children, we can all go to

REECE: Well er.For a start, that hat has got to go. And the pearls. In fact I think all hats may have to go. You look and sound like a privileged Conservative wife and we've already got her vote. You've got lovely hair but we need to do something with it - to make it Yes. Give it more impact. But the main thing is your voice. Its too high. It has no authority.
AIREY NEAVE: Yes. Give it more impact. But the main thing is your voice. Its too high. It has no authority.

AIREY NEAVE: Methinks the Lady doth screech too People don't want to be harangued by a woman or hectored. Persuaded yes. That `oh yes' at the end of the interview, that's authoritative, that's the voice of a leader.
REECE: People don't want to be harangued by a woman or hectored. Persuaded yes. That `oh yes' at the end of the interview, that's authoritative, that's the voice of a leader.
MARGARET: It's all very well to talk about changing my voice, Mr Reece, but for some of my colleagues to imagine me as their leader would be like imagining, I don't know, being led into battle by their chambermaid. It's my background, and my sex. No matter how I've tried, and I have tried, to fit in, I will never be truly one of
REECE: If I may say so - I think that's your trump card. You're flying in the face of everything the Tories have been thus far. It's really very exciting. One simply has to maximise your appeal, bring out all your qualities and make you look, and sound, like the leader that you could be.
NEAVE: You've got it in you to go the whole distance.
REECE: Prime Minister?! Oh no. Oh no no no. In Britain? There will be no female Prime Minister here, not in my lifetime. No. And I told Airey, I don't expect to win the leadership, but I am going to run. Just to shake up the party.
MARGARET: Prime Minister?! Oh no. Oh no no no. In Britain? There will be no female Prime Minister here, not in my lifetime. No. And I told Airey, I don't expect to win the leadership, but I am going to run. Just to shake up the party.
NEAVE: Respectfully, Margaret, I disagree. If you want to change this party, lead it. If you want to change the country, lead it. What we're talking about here today is surface. What's crucial is that you hold your course, and stay true to who you are. Never be anything other than yourself.
REECE: Leave us to do the rest.

MARGARET: It has to be something icy on a stick for Denis. That's the only way we will produce jobs, real jobs, jobs that
MARGARET: The Trade Union Movement was founded to protect workers. Now it persecutes them. It stops them from working. It is killing jobs and it is bringing this country to its knees. I say enough. It's time to get up. It's time to go to work. It's time to put the Great back into Great Britain!

DENIS: This is it, steady the buffs old
MARGARET: I should just like to say that I take very seriously the trust the British people placed in me today, and I will work hard every day to live up to that responsibility. And now, I should like to share with you a prayer of St Francis of Assisi: Where there is discord may we bring harmony. Where there is error may we bring truth. Where there is doubt may we bring faith. Where there is despair may we bring hope..
MARGARET: Shoulders back, tummies in!
MARGARET: I'm perfectly healthy. There's no need for any of this. Just let them look under the bonnet, MT. Check everything is hunky dory.

BBC VOICEOVER: Baroness Thatcher made an apparently routine visit to her doctor today. Although rarely seen in public, Lady Thatcher, the longest serving Prime Minister of the twentieth century, remains a controversial figure.

MP 1: The U.S. Secretary of State has arrived, Prime Minister.
GENERAL HAIG: So you are proposing to go to war over these Islands. They're thousands of miles away, a handful of citizens, politically and economically. insignificant, if you'll excuse me -
MARGARET: Just like Hawaii, I imagine.
GENERAL HAIG: I'm sorry?
MARGARET: 1941, when Japan attacked Pearl Harbour. Did America go cap in hand and ask Tojo for a peaceful negotiation of terms? Did she turn her back on her own citizens there because the islands were thousands of miles from mainland United States? No, no, no! We will stand on principle or we shall not stand at all.
GENERAL HAIG: But Margaret with all due respect when one has been to war..
MARGARET: With all due respect sir, I have done battle every single day of my life, and many men have underestimated me before. This lot seem bound to do the same but they will rue the day.
BEAT: MARGARET turns to a tea trolley close by-
MARGARET: Is this ship a threat?
ADMIRAL FIELDHOUSE: Both of these ships are carrying Exocet missiles, Prime Minister. Just yesterday they launched- then aborted- an attack inside the exclusion zone. There is a risk they could try it again.
FRANCIS PYM: The Belgrano is sailing directly away from the islands. Can it really be regarded as a threat ?
ADMIRAL FIELDHOUSE: She's been changing course continually. There's a strong possibility that they're attempting a pincer movement on our carrier group.
FRANCIS PYM: It'll play badly internationally. We'll be seen as aggressors.
JOHN NOTT: This will be an escalation, Prime
LEACH: If there is to be an escalation, it's better that we start it.
MINISTER: It is steaming away, Prime
MARGARET: Sink it.
JOHN NOTT: Prime Minister -
MARGARET: ( sotto voce ) I must write to them.
JOHN NOTT: Prime Minister?
MARGARET: The families. I must write to
MARGARET: Foreign Secretary.
PYM: I've just been briefed by Admiral He told me bluntly that if the Argentinians are prepared and willing to risk their aircraft, they have enough missiles to cripple most of our fleet.
JOHN NOTT: President Reagan and President Bellaunde of Peru have some new proposals for the peace plan -
MARGARET: ( sharply ) The peace plan? There will be no appeasement. This is a war. A war they started and by God, we will finish. Shall I tell you what I'm going to write to every single one of these families, these heartbroken families? I am going to tell them that no British soldier will die in vain for the
MILITARY VOICE: Lieutenant Colonel Jones. Captain Wood. Captain Dench. Lieutenant Farlaine. Corporal Hardman. Corporal Sullivan. Corporal Briar.
RADIO VO: Shortly after dark last night, our forces executed what our Commander in Chief has called a brilliant surprise night attack.
DENIS: Thatcher, bed.
RADIO: From their new positions, our forces can see large numbers of Argentine soldiers retreating and streaming back into Port Stanley. Our forces are moving forward to exploit their success.
MARGARET: We were faced with an act of unprovoked aggression and we responded as we have responded in times past: with unity, strength and courage, sure in the knowledge that though much is sacrificed, in the end, right will prevail over
DENIS: GOTCHA! Well that paid off old girl! Your ratings soared! From the most hated Prime Minister of all time to the nation's darling.The world was at your feet, and Britain was back in
NEWS READER: The Berlin Wall has fallen. The gates have opened! The police are making no attempt to stop people as they go through.
MARGARET: I don't agree in any measure!
GEOFFREY HOWE: But Prime Minister the question of the European single currency will come up.
MARGARET: I don't think the country is ready for it yet.
GEOFFREY HOWE: But we cannot bury our heads in the sand.
NEWS JOURNALIST: - that there must be a change in that style of management. That Mrs Thatcher must listen more, and on occasion, give in.
MARGARET: There it is again! Why not?
MINISTER 1: Because -
MINISTER 2: Because people. on the whole. think that the tax is manifestly Nonsense. Arrant nonsense. This is a simple proposition. In order to live in this country, you must pay for the privilege- something, anything! If you pay nothing, you care nothing. What do you care where you throw your rubbish? Your council estate is a mess, your town, graffiti, what do you care? It's not your problem , it's somebody else's problem- it's the government's problem! YOUR problem is, some of you, is that you haven't got the courage for this fight. You haven't had to fight hard for anything. It's all been given to you- and you feel guilty about it! Well, may I say, on behalf of all those who HAVE had to fight their way up, ( and who don't feel guilty about it ) we resent those slackers who take, take, take, and contribute nothing to the community!

HOWE: Here it is, Prime Minister. Of
MARGARET: The wording is sloppy here, and If you say so.
HOWE: If you say so.
MARGARET: I do say so.
HOWE: It's merely a first draft.
MARGARET: This is ridiculous. There are two "T's" in "committee"!
ANGRY CROWD: ( chanting ) Can't pay, won't pay! Can't pay, won't pay! Can't pay, won't pay!
PROTESTORS: Out. Out. Out.

GEOFFREY: My letter of resignation.
SILENCE: GEOFFREY HOWE
GEOFFREY HOWE: Our differences, I'm afraid, cannot be reconciled.
HOWE: I have done what I believe to be right for my party and my country. The time has come for others to consider their own response to the tragic conflict of loyalties with which I have myself wrestled for perhaps too long.
TV JOURNALIST: It's extraordinary. The rules of the Conservative Party make it possible for Conservative MP's to depose a sitting Prime Minister.
MARGARET: I am the Prime Minister.
TREVOR MACDONALD: Tonight in Paris Mrs Thatcher is among thirty four world leaders who came together to celebrate the end of the Cold War and herald the start of a peaceful new age of East/West cooperation.
NEWS JOURNALIST: There's a general feeling that Mrs Thatcher is going to win on the first ballot. We're going to put it to bed tomorrow night, is how one of her campaign staff puts it.
TREVOR MACDONALD: Will she, or will she not, be in the job tomorrow?
MARGARET: Her cabinet are all around her dining room table. There is no seat for her. She moves round the table.
MINISTER 1: We will never win another election led by that woman.
MINISTER 2: We need a leader who listens.
MINISTER 3: This isn't about her, it's about the party.
MINISTER 4: One must know when to go.
MINISTER 1: The question is, how does anyone put it to her?
MINISTER: If you were to stand, I of course would vote for you Prime Minister
MINISTER 2: - of course would vote for you Prime Minister but I don't think you can win. The loyalty of my colleagues cannot be counted upon.
MARGARET: It was the people who put me here -
MINISTER 3: The loyalty of my colleagues cannot be counted upon.
MARGARET: - it's up to them to tell me when to go.
DENIS: Margaret, you can't let them do this to you. Please, boss.
MARGARET: Oh Denis.
MARGARET: -proud to have left Britain in a much better state than when we took office.
DENIS: Steady, MT.
MARGARET VO: All those years of taking the tough decisions, does any of it matter now?
DENIS: It's all been turned to mush!
MARGARET: DENIS lies on the bed behind her with the newspaper.
DENIS: By these fools! These lily-livered These inept placators.
MARGARET: These inept placators.
DENIS: Very good! These vacillators.
MARGARET: Vacillators! Poll takers.
DENIS: Popularity seekers.
MARGARET: So busy taking the pulse of the Weak -
DENIS: Weak -

DENIS: Or forget you entirely and chuck you out with the rubbish!
DENIS: And you did, love, you did.
MARGARET: Denis? Denis?
MARGARET: ( seeing he is walking away in his socks ) Denis wait.Where are your shoes? You can't go without shoes! Not
DENIS: Steady the buffs -
MARGARET: Steady the buffs -
DENIS: Steady the buffs -

DENIS: You're going to be fine on your own, love. You always have been.
MARGARET: ( calling out )
CAROL OOV: CAROL looming over Margaret, looking horrified.
CAROL: My God, Mum. Are you alright? Mummy you should have called for help, silly old sausage. Have you not even been in your bed properly? You've done all this?
MARGARET: Yes, all sorted. Finished.
