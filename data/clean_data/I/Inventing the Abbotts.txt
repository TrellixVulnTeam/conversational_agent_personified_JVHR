DOUG: Didn't get invited, huh?
JACEY: Go to hell.
DOUG: Who cares? I'm not going and I got invited.
JACEY: Who invited you?

JACEY: It was busy all night.
ELEANOR: Maybe you had the wrong number?
JACEY: Are you mad at me?
ELEANOR: No. Are you mad at me?
JACEY: No. Who said I was?
ELEANOR: I did.
JACEY: I just wanted to talk to you last We can talk tonight at the party.
ELEANOR: We can talk tonight at the party.
JACEY: I wasn't invited.
ELEANOR: Yes, you were.
JACEY: No, I wasn't.
ELEANOR: Well, now you are. But if you're mad at me you don't have to come.
JACEY: Oh, Christ!
JACEY: He has to wash it off, Mother. You cannot let him go to the party unless he washes it off.
DOUG: It'll look worse if I wash it. It's India ink, it'll turn gray, it'll look like dirt.
JACEY: He looks like such a clown and he doesn't even know it! He doesn't get how things work in this town. I thought you weren't even going to the party?
DOUG: Changed my mind.
HELEN: Doug, you do understand that you may be the only person at this party with artificial sideburns?
DOUG: You do understand that your sideburns don't look real?
HELEN: You do understand that your sideburns don't look real?
DOUG: That they look, really, as though you'd drawn them on?
HELEN: That they look, really, as though you'd drawn them on?
DOUG: ( swallows, then
HELEN: Well, darling, it seems he does understand. Why don't you just go on to the party and ignore Doug. Just have a good time and pretend you don't even.
ELEANOR: I'm going out to the lake tomorrow. Sandy wants to show-off her dad's new boat. Why don't you I have to work.

"MONA LISA.": So, is this Peter guy Alice is gonna marry rich?
DOUG: So, is this Peter guy Alice is gonna marry rich?
PAMELA: Of course. He's one of the Atlas Steel Vanlaninghams. Pittsburgh. He's a bully.
DOUG: So how come Alice's marrying him?
PAMELA: Because my parents want her to and Alice is afraid of my parents. It's practically an arranged marriage. They think Alice has peanut shells for brains or something, so they sort of suggested that maybe it was time to tie the old knot and they sort of suggested that Peter was the one to do it with.
DOUG: Jeez, no one can be that much of a INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 2/16/96 8.
PAMELA: Look, Alice is the good daughter, Eleanor is the bad one, and I'm the one who sort of gets off the hook. That's just the way it works. Which one are you?
DOUG: You mean, which kind of brother am I? You got me? The little brother, I guess.
LLOYD: Ladies and Gentlemen I'd like to propose a toast in honor of our cause for celebration tonight the engagement of our daughter, Alice, to Mister Peter
DOUG: Three out of five?
JACEY: Two out of three. You serve.
JACEY: Fill 'er up. Hi-test.

JACEY: That was a nice party last night.
LLOYD: You were there?
JACEY: Yes, sir. Eleanor invited me.
LLOYD: Did she? Didn't see you. You going to be an engineer like your dad was?
JACEY: I want to be an architect.
LLOYD: Hmmm. I guess some people care more about having ideas that they do about making money.
JACEY: I care about making money.
LLOYD: That full suspension file drawer your dad invented is still in production, did you know that? We'll ship thirty-maybe-forty thousand of those file cabinets this year. Hell, that drawer put Midwest Steel Desk on the map.
JACEY: Yes, sir. I know.
LLOYD: An architect, huh?
LLOYD: You want some free advice?
JACEY: Don't waste your life making other people rich. Keep the change.
LLOYD: Don't waste your life making other people rich. Keep the change.
VICTOR: Jeez Louise! How'd you do that?
DOUG: Intestinal gas produced by bacterial metabolism of food residues in the colon. A mixture of oxygen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane. That's the secret ingredient.
VICTOR: What's so secret about it?
DOUG: Not everyone can produce methane. It's genetic, that means it's inherited. There's a lot of methane in my family.
VICTOR: You're full of shit.
DOUG: Look it up, it's all in the They don't got farts in the Hey, they got 'vagina' in the dictionary, they got farts in the

JACEY: Don't tell Mom.
DOUG: Oh, shit.
JACEY: ( cutting him off ) Just don't tell Mom. All right?
DOUG: Yeah, okay, all right.
ELEANOR: For what?
JACEY: For what?
ELEANOR: I heard you got accepted to Penn.
JACEY: Oh. Yeah. Thanks.
ELEANOR: How'd you swing an Ivy League school like that?
JACEY: My grandfather went there. I had the grades, so.
ELEANOR: It stinks in here.
JACEY: I dropped something.
ELEANOR: Yeah, me.
JACEY: I just thought you and Steve.
ELEANOR: Well, that's what you thought. I think Steve is. I don't even know what I think about Steve, I never think about him. I just do things. And let other people figure them out. That's what parents are for. They're real good at doing all the thinking. Why should I? Alice is going to have a baby. She and Kilroy didn't waste any time. He's already talking about having another, and Alice is up- chucking every hour on the hour. She's got morning-noon-and-night sickness. I've got the feeling she'll be barefoot and puking for years to come. Wallpaper patterns that's all she talks about. She and my mother spend hours looking at wallpaper pattern books. That's another thing I never think about. wallpaper. Well, I think this is called the silent treatment. I get enough of that from my father, I don't need it from you. Good luck at Penn.
PAMELA: Come on, Eleanor Dad's waiting.
LLOYD: Stay away from him.

LLOYD: Because I said so.
ELEANOR: Because I said so.
LLOYD: Because I said so.

DOUG: Get some beer, go swimming. Look up a few words in the dictionary.
VICTOR: Get some beer, go swimming. Look up a few words in the dictionary.
DOUG: Yeah, like 'boring' or 'eunuch.'
VICTOR: Eunuch? What's that?
DOUG: It's Latin for bus boy. Business is a little light today, too damn hot. Which one of you knuckle-heads wants to get off Me. I do.
WEBB: Business is a little light today, too damn hot. Which one of you knuckle-heads wants to get off Me. I do.

HELEN: I think he will.
JACEY: Not much.
HELEN: Oh, dammit, Jacey, please take your brother with you.
JACEY: Yes, ma'am.
JACEY: If Mom starts having problems with the car stalling just change the fuel filter. It gets clogged up when she lets the gas tank get too And every-once-in-a-while take her to the movies so she doesn't just sit around the house all the time She likes to read.
DOUG: And every-once-in-a-while take her to the movies so she doesn't just sit around the house all the time She likes to read.

JACEY: ( slight beat ) You want to go have a beer?
DOUG: Root beer?
JACEY: No, a beer.
DOUG: A beer beer?
JACEY: Where are we gonna get beer?
DOUG: Where are we gonna get beer?
JACEY: The bait shop. If you go in alone and nobody else is in the store, Ernie'll sell you a couple of Remember that time I got my dick caught in my zipper?
DOUG: Remember that time I got my dick caught in my zipper?
DOUG: You know, when I was in first grade. At school? In the boys' room? Remember I wouldn't let Mrs. Horton help me, so she went and got Mom out of her classroom, but I wouldn't let Mom help me either. I told her to go get you. Yeah, I remember.
JACEY: Yeah, I remember.
JACEY: We should own that company.
DOUG: What do you mean?
JACEY: Midwest Steel Desk. Dad's file cabinet drawer. Lloyd Abbott screwed mom out of Dad's patent after he died.
DOUG: Says who?
JACEY: It's true.
DOUG: Mom's not stupid.
JACEY: I didn't say she was stupid. Lloyd's pretty smooth. That's why he owns the company.
DOUG: He owns the company 'cause he married the boss's daughter.
JACEY: He owns the company 'cause that patent saved the company's ass after the war, when all the war contracts dried up.
DOUG: Well, maybe Mom sold it 'cause we needed the money.
JACEY: What money? We never had any money. Money had nothing to do with it.
DOUG: Then why did she sell the patent?
JACEY: She just did, that's all that matters. And that's why we're driving this car and not that one.
JACEY: I guess you'll just have to be real careful zipping up your pants while I'm gone.

DOUG: I got a three-point-two average.
PAMELA: Doesn't mean you know my sister.
DOUG: Oh yeah? You might be surprised.
PAMELA: About what? What? What?
DOUG: Why are we talking about Eleanor?
PAMELA: I didn't bring her up.
DOUG: Look, either you're mad at me 'cause you're mad at me or you're mad at me 'cause you like me. 'Cause that's how girls act. I don't know much, but I know that. So like which is it?
PAMELA: Doug exhales with bewilderment, stubs out his cigarette, then awkwardly slides down the sofa to Pamela. She holds perfectly still as Doug slowly moves his mouth to hers and kisses her. Then he concludes the kiss to check her reaction; she timidly smiles. He kisses her again with greater fervor. Doug creeps his hand up her blouse and massages her breast. Pamela struggles to suppress her surprise, which he mistakes as a sign of her approval. Emboldened by her lack of resistance, he slips his hand under her bra. Pam is shocked by the pleasure of the sensation, then alarmed by the pace of their passion.
PAMELA: Doug kisses her again and as they kiss he stares at a framed photograph of Eleanor amongst an assortment of family photos on the long table behind the sofa. It is Eleanor that he is thinking of in his mind's eye it is Eleanor's breast that he is fondling. Pamela pulls her lips from his:
PAMELA: Do you love me, Doug? Do you?
PAMELA: He tries to kiss her again but she twists her head away.
PAMELA: Stop it. stop it!
ACTION: Pamela dashes up the stairs. Doug comes out of the den looking for her. He is quite shaken:
DOUG: Pam? Hey. Oh, dammit.
DOUG: 46 INT. ABBOTT HOME - SECOND-FLOOR HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 46

ACTION: Peter and Alice are taking off their coats.
ALICE: Accidentally brushing your teeth with Brylcreme is a funny story.
PETER: Will you shut up about the fucking It comes in a red-and-white tube just like a tube of Pepsodent.
ALICE: It comes in a red-and-white tube just like a tube of Pepsodent.
PETER: Do you hear me, Alice?! Shut up!
PAMELA: The baby's crying.
LLOYD: Just stay out of it, Joan.
JOAN: Alice meant no harm, I think.
LLOYD: ( cutting her off ) It doesn't matter what you think, it's their business. Alice is a spoiled brat, but she's Peter's problem now. So just take one of your pills and go watch Jack Paar, see what he's crying about
PETER: I'm warning you, Alice! Open the damn door! Alice?! Dammit!
DOUG: Oh, shit! Let me out of here.
ELEANOR: Hi, Doug!
JACEY: Hey, Doug! Get my suitcase!
DOUG: How do you know when a girl's. What do you mean, `ready'? Ready for what. sex?
JACEY: What do you mean, `ready'? Ready for what. sex?
DOUG: They're all ready for sex.
JACEY: They're all ready for sex.
DOUG: They are?
JACEY: They might not be willing but they're ready. Just have to make them think you're the only one around who has what they need.
DOUG: How do you do that?
JACEY: Find out what's making them itch and scratch it. If they're scared, be dependable. If they're bored, be exciting. If they're on the rebound, catch them.
DOUG: What if you're not very dependable or exciting, you know?
JACEY: Pretend you are.
DOUG: You mean, it's all just fake?
JACEY: The sex is real. They pretend they don't want it. You pretend that you care. Everybody gets what they want.
DOUG: But what if you really feel something for someone? Really care for them?
JACEY: I thought you were talking about getting laid?
DOUG: I guess. I don't know what I'm talking about.
JACEY: No shit.

HELEN: Of course, come in.
JOAN: No. no, I don't have time. thank you.
HELEN: I don't think that's necessary.
JOAN: Well, if I were you I would talk to him and tell him.
HELEN: ( cutting her off ) No, I'm sorry, Joan, I will not do that. If you have something to say to my son, then you'll have to say it to him yourself.
JOAN: I just thought you would like to know what he's done.
HELEN: And why on earth should I believe anything you say, Joan?
HELEN: I'm going to ask you one question, Doug, and if you have no idea, or don't want to answer, just tell Is there any sense, you think, in which Jacey has. oh, I don't know, it sounds ridiculous. corrupted Eleanor Abbott? Led her
DOUG: Is there any sense, you think, in which Jacey has. oh, I don't know, it sounds ridiculous. corrupted Eleanor Abbott? Led her
HELEN: Is there any sense, you think, in which Jacey has. oh, I don't know, it sounds ridiculous. corrupted Eleanor Abbott? Led her
DOUG: Well. jeez. I know that he's. that he's slept with her. But not because he's talked about it. I mean. Eleanor has lots of boyfriends. I think Jacey likes her more than she likes him.
HELEN: ( long beat ) I see. ( another beat ) Go finish your homework.
DOUG: I got an incomplete in U.S. How did you manage to do that?
PAMELA: How did you manage to do that?
DOUG: Mrs. Bates caught me drawing boobs on a picture of Mamie Eisenhower.
PAMELA: ( laughs ) Why do you do things like that?
DOUG: I wish I knew. I just can't seem to help it sometimes.
PAMELA: Are you coming to the party?

DOUG: Oh mind if I borrow it?
JACEY: I thought you didn't like those parties at the Abbott's?
DOUG: I don't.
JACEY: Then why are you going?
DOUG: Just doing someone a favor. How come you're not going?
JACEY: I'm persona non grata.
DOUG: What's that mean?
JACEY: You know what it means.
DOUG: What happened with you and Nothing. I just outlived my usefulness, that's all.
JACEY: Nothing. I just outlived my usefulness, that's all.
DOUG: How were you `useful' to her?
JACEY: Christ, use your imagination.
JACEY: Eleanor was just looking for a way out. A way out of the whole Abbott world. And it turns out that it takes a lot to get away. It's not enough that you sleep around with boys from your world, you have to fuck boys from the wrong side of the tracks.
DOUG: What do you mean? Like guys from Fountain Park?
JACEY: No, I mean me. She was fucking Jacey hangs up the nozzle and screws the gas cap back on.
DOUG: We're not from the wrong side of the tracks.
JACEY: I wouldn't go to that party if I were you.

JACEY: You still don't know, do you?
DOUG: Know what?
CONTINUOUS ACTION: Doug follows Jacey inside as he rings up the sale.

DOUG: I don't believe you.
JACEY: Believe it or not. I don't care.

PAMELA: I accept your apology. Let's
PAMELA: Pam is in love with Doug, she has been since they were children. Doug is mellowed by his tender feelings for her. For a golden minute they are in pleasurable bubble of true affinity. But their bubble begins to deflate as Doug sees Joan Abbott staring at them. Her disapproval is unmistakable. Doug steers Pam around the dance floor to avoid Joan's eyes, but then he sees Lloyd Abbott. Lloyd's stare is even more discomforting. Pamela senses the change in Doug's mood, but she is unaware of the The mention of his brother's name at this exact moment sends a chill down Doug's spine.

PAMELA: You're not poor, are you?

JACEY: No. I was just thinking about you. I was going to call you
ALICE: ( rattled ) What? Why?
JACEY: There's a picnic out at River Point on Sunday I wanted to invite you.
ALICE: I couldn't.
JACEY: Bring Susan, kids love picnics.
ALICE: ( re: the dollar bill ) I need change for the parking Oh, thanks.

JACEY: Do you have time for an ice tea?
ALICE: My mother's waiting by the car so I won't get a ticket.
JACEY: Maybe she'd like an ice tea, too?
ALICE: No harm asking.
JACEY: No harm asking.
ALICE: No. Don't do that.
JACEY: Why not?
ALICE: You know why.
JACEY: Then I'll make you a deal.
ALICE: I just came in to get some change.
JACEY: Come to the picnic on Sunday and I'll wait here and let you leave first, so your mother won't see me.
ALICE: I don't care if my mother sees Then you won't care if I ask her if she'd like to join us for an ice tea?

PAMELA: You think you'll finish sometime today? I'm getting sun stroke.
DOUG: Put the top up.
PAMELA: Stop acting like Jacey. What makes you think you're so. cool?
DOUG: Because I know all the answers on 'The $64,000 Question,' because I have X-ray vision and I can sing better than Pat Boone. And because I'm really a negro, but don't tell anyone around here, 'cause you know what would happen to me.
PAMELA: God, I can't even talk to you.
PAMELA: Name one bad thing I've ever done to you.
DOUG: Go on, name one bad thing.
PAMELA: Go on, name one bad thing.
DOUG: What's the point?
PAMELA: You tell me, because I don't get it! Look, I'm not rich, my father is. And I didn't pick my father. And if I had a choice between having tons of money or having another father, I'd be absolutely delighted to be poor! But unfortunately life is not a Life is not a cafeteria?
DOUG: Life is not a cafeteria?
PAMELA: You know what I mean!
DOUG: Shit, I'm supposed to feel sorry for you 'cause you're rich?
PAMELA: Well, am I supposed to feel sorry for you 'cause you're so poor?
DOUG: So then just stop it!
PAMELA: So then just stop it!
DOUG: Stop what?!
PAMELA: Stop treating me like an Abbott!
DOUG: Well, how am I supposed to treat INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96 58.
PAMELA: Like you used to. Like just plain
PAMELA: And you don't have to say you're sorry, and you don't have to look like somebody just ran over your dog. You just make me want to scream sometimes.
PAMELA: What are you looking at?
DOUG: 90 EXT. RIVER POINT PARK - DAY ( FOLLOWING SUNDAY ) 90
JACEY: We are everyone.
ALICE: But you said.
JACEY: ( overlapping ) No, I didn't. I just said a picnic. I didn't say if anyone else was coming.
JACEY: Where are you going?
ALICE: I'm sorry. I thought.
JACEY: ( blocking her way ) You didn't come here to see everybody else. You came here to see me. Didn't you? That's why you didn't bring Susan along.
ALICE: I'm married.
JACEY: I thought you were getting a I am, but it's not final yet. Besides, I'm two years older than Good, if the cops come around we'll tell 'em you bought the beers in the cooler.
ALICE: I am, but it's not final yet. Besides, I'm two years older than Good, if the cops come around we'll tell 'em you bought the beers in the cooler.
JACEY: Good, if the cops come around we'll tell 'em you bought the beers in the cooler.
ALICE: I knew he would hit me. Peter's a real hot-head. I knew if he hit me hard enough, hurt me enough, that even my father wouldn't stand for it. Then one night I put too much soap in the washing machine and it overflowed. That did it. He punched me. Broke my front So. what do you hear from I don't. Do you?
JACEY: So. what do you hear from I don't. Do you?
ALICE: So. what do you hear from I don't. Do you?
JACEY: I don't. Do you?
ALICE: No. Did you love her?

JACEY: Then why did you marry him?
ALICE: 92 EXT. RIVERPOINT PARK - ROAD - LATER THAT DAY 92
JACEY: Which tooth was it? This one. I had it capped. You can't really tell, can you?
ALICE: This one. I had it capped. You can't really tell, can you?
JACEY: No. It's a beautiful mouth.
ALICE: Are you going to kiss me?
JACEY: I don't want to scare you.
ALICE: I can't see you again, Jacey.
JACEY: Sure you can. There are ways.
ALICE: Oh, God. why you? Why am I telling all these things to you?
JACEY: Because there's no one else you can tell them to. Because I'm the only person you know who will admit to your face that your father's a bag of shit. The biggest bag of shit in this town. Better head home. Shouldn't be gone too long.
PAMELA: Who do you look like more, your father or your mother?
DOUG: Hell, I don't know.
PAMELA: Well, what did your father look Like a photograph. I never knew him. He died like a month before I was even born. Jacey probably looks more like him than I do. Jacey's named after him. That's how he got to be called 'Jacey,' after his initials, John Charles,
DOUG: Like a photograph. I never knew him. He died like a month before I was even born. Jacey probably looks more like him than I do. Jacey's named after him. That's how he got to be called 'Jacey,' after his initials, John Charles,
PAMELA: He died in a car wreck, right?
DOUG: You never heard about that?
PAMELA: About what?
DOUG: Well, it was sort of a car wreck. He drowned, or froze to death, or both, I don't know. He was trying to drive out to Mud Island.
PAMELA: Mud Island's in the middle of the It was winter time, the lake was froze over.
DOUG: It was winter time, the lake was froze over.
PAMELA: Jesus, that's pretty stupid. It's all right, it is stupid. Real stupid. He did it on a bet. He bet someone twenty bucks that he could do it. He made it all the way out there, too. He went through the ice on his way back.
DOUG: It's all right, it is stupid. Real stupid. He did it on a bet. He bet someone twenty bucks that he could do it. He made it all the way out there, too. He went through the ice on his way back.
DOUG: I think my dad was like Jacey is. Some guys are just dare-devils. I bet Jacey once that he couldn't do a back-flip off the garage roof into a big pile of leaves. And he did it.
PAMELA: ( slight beat ) One time Eleanor and I snuck out and walked around the yard naked.
DOUG: You did?
PAMELA: Yeah. It was sort of a dare, too. She dared me, I dared her, so we both did it.
DOUG: Was this day or night?
PAMELA: Was there a full moon?
DOUG: Was there a full moon?
PAMELA: I don't remember.
DOUG: You walked around the yard or did you like run from tree to tree?
PAMELA: We just walked around the yard.
DOUG: Front yard or back yard?
PAMELA: Back yard.
DOUG: Does it matter?
PAMELA: Does it matter?
DOUG: Yeah. Back yard nudity is hypocritical. It's insincere. People should do and say exactly what they feel or think and not try to hide things.
PAMELA: Their conversation is stifled by this new standard of absolute honesty.
DOUG: Their conversation is stifled by this new standard of absolute honesty.
DOUG: You look pretty.
PAMELA: You look pretty.
DOUG: You look pretty.
PAMELA: Pamela takes his hand, gently unfolds it, and with her index finger she writes on his palm, "I love you." Telling him took all the nerve she could muster, she hasn't the stamina for a disappointing response she places her fingers on his lips to silence him. Doug leans over and kisses her, sweetly and tenderly, and for a long time. They will always remember this kiss.

DOUG: Aren't you curious?
PAMELA: No, I know what I look like without any clothes on I look Can I touch your breasts?
DOUG: Can I touch your breasts?
PAMELA: Just on the outside?
DOUG: Just on the outside?
PAMELA: No. You can kiss me. I like You like lips?
DOUG: You like lips?
PAMELA: I like your lips, block-head. I like being here like this. But I'm not taking my clothes off, 'cause if we do that, you know what we'll do. And I'm too. I don't want to be like my sisters. Not if I can help it.
DOUG: Who is it?

DOUG: My brother. He just went upstairs with your sister.
PAMELA: With Eleanor?
DOUG: 103 EXT. HOLT HOME - STREET - NIGHT 103
DOUG: Hey. hold up!
PAMELA: Why didn't you tell me?
DOUG: Hell, I didn't know. What does this got to do with us?
PAMELA: My God. what is she doing?
DOUG: Why is it okay for you to sneak around with me, but it's not all right for Alice to sneak around with Jacey?
PAMELA: Because I'm not Alice! And you're not Jacey! Alice is. is like my mom, they both get hurt so easy, they're like turtles without Come on, take it easy.
DOUG: Come on, take it easy.
PAMELA: You don't know my father. You don't know how he is about Jacey. He blames him for everything that happened with Eleanor.
DOUG: Eleanor fooled around with lots of guys, it's not Jacey's fault your dad kicked her out.
PAMELA: Oh, Jesus! He didn't kick her out, he put her in a nut house! He shipped her off to this clinic in Wisconsin.
DOUG: ( taken aback ) But. I thought you said she's in She is now. They let her out a month ago.
PAMELA: She is now. They let her out a month ago.
DOUG: Oh, shit.
PAMELA: Yeah. Shit.
JACEY: Alice. wait!
ALICE: Go away.
JACEY: It's the truth, you know it is.
ALICE: No, no, it's all just. screwing.
JACEY: It's called making love.
ALICE: Don't what?
JACEY: Don't what?
ALICE: Don't follow me.
JACEY: What's wrong?
ALICE: I spend all day, every day, just waiting and waiting to be with you, waiting to forget everything, you make me forget. but then when I get dressed and I come home, you. just. leak out of me. Leak away. I go into the bathroom and I wash you off of me and I remember everything.
JACEY: Remember what?
ALICE: Yes, Daddy.
LLOYD: Who are you talking to?
PAMELA: Just girl talk.
LLOYD: You can talk inside. It's late.
DOUG: What's up?
PAMELA: What's up?
DOUG: What's up?
PAMELA: I've been thinking maybe we shouldn't see each other right Oh, yeah? Why?
DOUG: Oh, yeah? Why?
PAMELA: Well. if my father. I don't really care what would happen to me if he found out I was seeing you, but I have to take care of Alice and my mother and Eleanor, and. well, it would be hard for me to do that if I were in the doghouse, too. You know?
DOUG: Christ, why do you have to take care of them?
PAMELA: ( shrugs ) No one else will.
DOUG: Okay. Sure. See you around.
HELEN: Who's upstairs with Jacey?
DOUG: Alice Abbott.

DOUG: I don't know, but I wouldn't hold up dinner.
HELEN: Do you want dinner?

JACEY: I know. I had to bring her here today. She couldn't see me tonight and there was nowhere else we could I can appreciate that, Jacey, I love her, Mother. I'm going to marry her.
HELEN: I can appreciate that, Jacey, I love her, Mother. I'm going to marry her.
JACEY: I love her, Mother. I'm going to marry her.
HELEN: Do her parents know about this?
JACEY: Of course not.
HELEN: Don't you think they should?
JACEY: I don't give a damn about them.
HELEN: Does Alice feel the same as you She loves me.
JACEY: She loves me.
HELEN: Has she agreed to marry you?
JACEY: She will. She needs time. She's frightened. It's not easy for How does hiding it from her family make it any easier?
HELEN: How does hiding it from her family make it any easier?
JACEY: We don't have any choice.
HELEN: Alice is a grown woman, she's a mother with a child of her own; if she really loves you then she All that matters is that I get her away from them before they find I can't be a party to that, Jacey.
JACEY: ( cutting her off ) All that matters is that I get her away from them before they find I can't be a party to that, Jacey.
HELEN: I can't be a party to that, Jacey.
JACEY: I don't need your help. I'm not asking for it.
HELEN: ( slight beat ) You'll have to find somewhere else to take Alice I can't have you bringing her here again. I'm

JACEY: Leave me alone, just leave me
LATER ): Pam's convertible barely comes to a halt at the curb before Jacey comes charging out of the house to Pam. Doug is occupied with the lawn mower; he doesn't notice Pam and Jacey at first. ( Jacey and Pam have to speak over the din of the LAWN MOWER. )
JACEY: How is she?
PAMELA: She's all right.
JACEY: Can I see her?
PAMELA: At the boathouse at the lake.
DOUG: What's going on?
PAMELA: I had to. for Alice's sake.
DOUG: ( puzzled ) Had to what? What?
PAMELA: Tell Jacey I'm sorry.
LLOYD: I have plans for my daughters, Mr. Holt, and they don't include you. I know you. I know you better than you know me. I know all there is to know about screwing your way into a wealthy family. I'll never let you screw your way into mine.

LLOYD: Behind you, Mr. Holt.
JACEY: Come with me. Please, Alice, just come with me now, right now.
ALICE: I told you. I can't.
LLOYD: Now, get out of here, you runt stud. And keep your poor-boy dick out of my daughters.
HELEN: Why spend all night and half the day tomorrow waiting in Chicago for the Philadelphia bus? Why not just wait and take the morning bus to Chicago?
JACEY: Because. the sooner I get out of this fucking town the better.
HELEN: ( slight beat; stung ) Suit yourself.
DOUG: Dammit. why can't he just leave them alone?
HELEN: The Abbotts. I don't know why. why couldn't he just forget 'em? Just pretend they didn't even If the Abbotts didn't exist, Jacey would've had to invent them, one way or another. There are no ends of Abbotts in the world, if that's what you need.
DOUG: The Abbotts. I don't know why. why couldn't he just forget 'em? Just pretend they didn't even If the Abbotts didn't exist, Jacey would've had to invent them, one way or another. There are no ends of Abbotts in the world, if that's what you need.

DOUG: What do you mean, how do you know?
HELEN: I was just a wreck when Charlie
DOUG: After Charlie died Lloyd Abbott started dropping by on his way home from work. He felt so bad about that bet Charlie made with him at the lake. That foolish, idiotic bet. Poor Lloyd I felt sorry for him. He'd have a cup of coffee with Mother and me. If a doorknob had come off he'd fix it. He'd carry the garbage cans to the curb. Someone dies, people try to be helpful. But he was by here so often that people started to talk. It was fairly obvious that he wanted something more from me than just a cup of coffee. I suggested that he didn't need to stop by here so often, but. then one afternoon I was at Woolworth's, having lunch at the counter. All of sudden Joan Abbott was standing there screaming and yelling at me to stop sleeping with her husband, with Lloyd. I was speechless. She was gone before I could find my tongue.

HELEN: I went to see Joan, I tried to talk to her, to put her mind at ease, but.
DOUG: Dammit, why didn't Lloyd tell her that nothing had happened?
HELEN: I'm sure he did, but men always say that, darling. Besides, Lloyd was always having affairs. He's that type of man.
DOUG: Ahhh, Jesus. but why? Why did everyone in town believe Joan Because she's Joan Abbott. If you cross Joan you don't get invited to her parties and the Abbotts have the best parties in town. The only parties.
HELEN: Because she's Joan Abbott. If you cross Joan you don't get invited to her parties and the Abbotts have the best parties in town. The only parties.

PAMELA: Oh, Doug, it's beautiful.
DOUG: The senior acting class does scenes from different plays, they invite everybody, it's a real big deal. So, there's this competition among all the theater design students to do the sets. And anyway I'm the one whose design got picked.
PAMELA: What scene is it for? What play?
DOUG: ( a tad embarrassed ) Umm. Romeo and Juliet. It's something different, I think that's why they picked it. Everybody else was doing castles and stuff. Rooftop Romeo and Juliet by Douglas L. Holt.
PAMELA: You're really good at this.
DOUG: It's like building models when I was a kid. It's fun. It's. You know, they tore that old farmhouse down?
PAMELA: You know, they tore that old farmhouse down?
DOUG: Oh, no. Did they?

DOUG: You have a boyfriend, right?
PAMELA: Well, what? You worried what your old man would think?
DOUG: Well, what? You worried what your old man would think?
PAMELA: He doesn't care what I do, as long as I don't do it in Haley.
DOUG: Then what's the problem?
PAMELA: I can't. do this.
DOUG: Why not? I mean. okay. We don't have to go so fast. Shit, I'm sorry. I blew it again, huh?
PAMELA: No, I did.
DOUG: Pam climbs down off the stage and starts up the aisle.
PAMELA: I'm on probation. They pulled a bed-check the night I was here. I have to be back in the dorm by ten. Gotta go.
DOUG: What about tomorrow? I could come up in the afternoon and.
PAMELA: No! It's just too late. It's all messed up. I can't seem to make things all right. The more I try the worse everything gets. I'm
DOUG: Pam! It's not too late!
CLERK #1: Pam some guy named Doug keeps calling for you.
JACEY: What's wrong with you?
DOUG: A boiling water KETTLE starts to WHISTLE ( O.S. ) Jacey goes into the kitchen to tend to it. There is a soft KNOCK on the front door. Doug goes to answer it. He opens the door and finds Pamela standing there with her coat in her hand. He is pleasantly surprised; Pam is distant, slightly off-balance.
DOUG: ( CONTINUED )
PAMELA: ( CONTINUED )
DOUG: How did you know I was here?
JACEY: I told you not to come by on I forgot. Dammit, why didn't you call first?
PAMELA: I forgot. Dammit, why didn't you call first?
JACEY: Dammit, why didn't you call first?
PAMELA: Didn't have any nickels.
JACEY: Well, I didn't expect to see you again. You want to fuck? I mean, that's why you came over, right?
PAMELA: ( slight beat ) Then take off your clothes.
JACEY: Then take off your clothes.
THAT NIGHT: Doug enters the dormitory and starts up the stairs.
DOUG: Fuck you.
JACEY: I didn't know.
DOUG: You didn't know what?!
JACEY: How you felt about Pam.
DOUG: Fuck you.
JACEY: I'm sorry.
DOUG: Apologize to her, you asshole!
JACEY: I did. I ran into her a few weeks ago at a party. She was drinking and I. it was easy. She felt guilty about telling her father about Alice and me. Actually, I made her feel guilty, I made her feel like she had betrayed Alice.
DOUG: She didn't betray Alice! She was just trying to get rid of you so Alice wouldn't try to kill herself again. Jesus Christ, you shit- head, Alice couldn't marry you!
JACEY: I know. I mean, I do now.
DOUG: Then what the hell did Pam ever do to deserve your revenge?
JACEY: ( CONTINUED )
DOUG: Just your way of evening the score with Lloyd Abbott, right?
JACEY: Doug spins and delivers a wild, roundhouse punch that lands brutally on the side of Jacey's face the impact knocks him down onto the steps. Jacey's eyebrow has split open, he is blinded by blood.
DOUG: I don't know you! I don't know who the fuck you are! You fuck everything. You fuck everything up! Why did you have to fuck Pam,
DOUG: Pamela Abbott, please. Tell her Doug is here.
CLERK #2: She's not here.

CLERK #2: She left. last night.
DOUG: Where did she go?
CLERK #2: I don't know.
DOUG: Well, did she go home?
CLERK #2: No one seems to know. She just took some clothes and left.
DOUG: ( lost ) Oh, God. no.
CLERK #2: Look, I'm not supposed to do this, but. well, I can give you her home address.
DOUG: ( explodes with irony ) Shit! Yeah, right. ( slight beat ) I mean. thanks. Thanks anyway. I know her home address.
DOUG: Where's Pam?
ALICE: I don't know.
DOUG: Is she with Eleanor?
ALICE: I don't know.
DOUG: In Chicago?
ALICE: I don't know.
DOUG: I couldn't find Eleanor's name in the Chicago phone book.
ALICE: Maybe it's unlisted.
DOUG: Well, do you know Eleanor's No. I don't know her address, I don't know her phone number. You'd have to ask my father for it. All right?
ALICE: No. I don't know her address, I don't know her phone number. You'd have to ask my father for it. All right?
DOUG: Are you okay?
HELEN: I'm fine.
DOUG: You look. tired.
HELEN: Just a cold.
DOUG: You sure?
HELEN: I do wish Jacey had come home for Christmas. Maybe that's what's wrong with me.
DOUG: I guess that free-lance drafting job was too good for him to turn I don't think that's why he didn't come home. I wrote him a letter, you know. About Lloyd and me. Has he mentioned it to you?
HELEN: I don't think that's why he didn't come home. I wrote him a letter, you know. About Lloyd and me. Has he mentioned it to you?
DOUG: Doug wants to avoid the topic of Jacey. He opens the

HELEN: Sometimes I do, don't I? I don't know. When I think of him, I think of 'Charlie.'
DOUG: Did you ever. meet anybody else?
HELEN: You mean another man?
DOUG: Well, everyone always thinks things are more possible than they are. I mean, single men don't stay in Haley if they have any starch. The only eligible man around was Drew Carter, but he smells like his dog.
HELEN: Well, everyone always thinks things are more possible than they are. I mean, single men don't stay in Haley if they have any starch. The only eligible man around was Drew Carter, but he smells like his dog.

DOUG: Sorry about what?
LLOYD: You didn't know your mother at all if you think someone like me would've ever stood a chance with someone like her. That just goes to show you how stupid this town is that they'd believe she slept with me. That'd make Charlie laugh. Your old man was my best friend. He used to call me 'Egg-head' hell, everybody did. And back then everybody knew that Egg-head Abbott didn't stand a snowball's chance in hell with Helen Riley. Of course, that was all before I became Lloyd Abbott Mr. Abbott. That was back when I still had chicken shit on my shoes and twelve cents in my pocket. Charlie Holt was the only one good enough for Helen. I used to spy on 'em yup, I did. Used to watch them sit on the front porch of her house your house and watch 'em talk.
