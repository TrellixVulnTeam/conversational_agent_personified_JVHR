DEBBIE: This is not what the Lord wants.
STEVEN: So you're saying you know what the Lord No. I would never say that. Why? Do you think this is what he wants?
DEBBIE: No. I would never say that. Why? Do you think this is what he wants?
STEVEN: It's the leap of faith Deb. It's the not knowing that's the answer.
DEBBIE: Well I never thought about it that way.
DEBBIE: "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 22. And as Steven listens to Debbie's rant
STEVEN: Morning Sandy!
CHERUBIC SECRETARY: Morning Steven. You have visitors.
STEVEN: Steven quickly gets a deeply concerned look on his face as he approaches his office. The door is slightly ajar. He secretly peeks in to see. TWO FEDERAL MARSHALLS wait in Steven's office. He instantly knows what's going on.

KEMPLE: Like the fact that he was a big queer?
DEBBIE: Yeah, like that.
KEMPLE: But suicide, my god.
DEBBIE: Well he does tend to overreact.
KEMPLE: I feel like I don't even know him.
DEBBIE: Well Jimmy, that's the thing. I'm not really sure he knows who he is. He's searching, at least that's how I figure it. I'm just not sure he knows what it is he's looking for.
KEMPLE: ( to cop ) Can you tell me exactly what he did?
COP: He has several warrants out in Texas. Fraud, forgery, embezzlement.
DEBBIE: I should have known. I should have said Don't blame yourself Jimmy. I did the same thing. There were always signs. I should have known he was gay when he started shaving his chest.
KEMPLE: I should have known. I should have said Don't blame yourself Jimmy. I did the same thing. There were always signs. I should have known he was gay when he started shaving his chest.
DEBBIE: Don't blame yourself Jimmy. I did the same thing. There were always signs. I should have known he was gay when he started shaving his chest.
KEMPLE: That would be a warning sign.
DEBBIE: And all that Peter Allen music on his Denial is a powerful thing. I don't feel so bad now.
KEMPLE: Denial is a powerful thing. I don't feel so bad now.

STEVEN: Three meals a day. Not so bad. Just make sure if you make enemies with someone, he doesn't work here. Otherwise you'll wake up one morning shitting blood and find out you've been eating ground glass in your cornbread for six weeks.
GARY: ( mid-sentence ) .letters, magazines, shit like that- it all goes through unmolested. But if Grandma's sending you cookies, or porn or brownies or whatever you're gonna have to pay for it if you wanna get it. Five bucks per item or you can suck my dick.

STEVEN: It's a beautiful fixture.
JUDGE: I know. It's your turn.
STEVEN: ( then ) Your Honor, Ms. Mixon engaged Mr. Gage service in good faith and was given an inferior product. She is entitled to deem that work to be unacceptable according to the contract that Mr. Evans signed.

STEVEN: I'll admit your honor- I'm a plain spoken man. I didn't go to Princeton. I didn't go to Yale. My education was modest. I went to a small school. I grew up on a small farm. But I passed the same bar exam as my colleague here and I am not going to let him push around this humble
JUDGE: Point taken Mister Russell.
STEVEN: I think it's obvious where I'm going with this sir.
JUDGE: Are you talking about Marshall vs. Chao?
LAWYER: ( sotto )

LINDHOLM: Ass gasket. Have a seat.

STEVEN: Uh.. cup of coffee?
RHEBA: I'll do it today but I don't do that
MARK: Crossover from traditional markets shows declination and inverse diffusion seems commensurate with net-trade trending. HMO penetration still leads PPO, NMO and FMO as usual but attenuation is growing more prevalent in Q4 as projected. As for Q3, well Q3 is what Q3 always is: Q2 with training wheels.
BIRKHEIM: Okay Steven, your turn. I know you've only had the one quarter to play catch up but I tell you, we can't wait to get some insight here.
STEVEN: Sure. What about?
BIRKHEIM: Mark's projections.
STEVEN: Mmm hm. Sure.

LINDHOLM: Yeah. Probably deploying the arm right now. Just a satellite deployment. Nothing special. Just touching the face of God.
LINDHOLM: Bev- Ladies- I want you to meet Steven Russell, our CFO.
MRS. LINDHOLM: Oh I heard about you.

STEVEN: Kind of. I just got back from my lawyer's office. I asked him, "What's your fee?" He says, "I charge $50 for three questions." So I ask, "Don't you think that's a little expensive?" And he says, "Yes it is. Now what's your final
VERA: It's so true. Lawyers!
BIRKHEIM: That's the thing about the back nine at Pebble Beach.
LINDHOLM: I couldn't agree with you more. I remember one time, I was at Augusta.
SECRETARY: The woman says,"That's awful expensive, isn't it?" and the lawyer says, "Yes and now you only got one question left!"
LINDHOLM: ( to cook ) Mushroom and cheese.

Next question please!"
STEVEN: Yeah that's a good one.
LINDHOLM: That's why there's so few shuttle missions. They're wasting all their money on bureaucracy. And probes. Unmanned probes. Like people care if there's life on Mars. No mushrooms, I said.

LINDHOLM: Hell of a hazard ain't it Steven?
CLIENT: So the black fella says to the jew lawyer- "50 bucks a question? Ain't that expensive?" "Yeah it's expensive," he says, "I'm a Jew, you nigger!"
RHEBA: Anything else I can do for you?
STEVEN: Uh.. cup of coffee?
