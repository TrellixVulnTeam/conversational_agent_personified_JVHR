ID4: INDEPENDENCE DAY
INDEPENDENCE DAY: AN AMERICAN FLAG Oddly still, posted in gray dusty sand.
SUPERVISOR: If this isn't an insanely beautiful woman, I'm hanging up.
TECH ONE: Shut up and listen. He holds the phone up to a speaker, increases the volume. A strange FLUCTUATING TONE plays out in sequential patterns.
SUPERVISOR: God, I hope it's not just another damned Russian spy job.
TECH THREE: ( overlapping ) Negative. Computer affirms the signal is unidentified.
TECH TWO: ( hanging up the phone ) The boy from Air Res Traffic say the skies are clear. No terrestrial It's the real thing. A radio signal from another world. The room becomes quiet as they realize that after years of searching the heavens, they might have finally found Let's not jump the gun. Run a trajectory source computation. Tech Three slides over to another computer. I want to know exactly where it's coming from.

SUPERVISOR: Let's not jump the gun. Run a trajectory source computation. Tech Three slides over to another computer. I want to know exactly where it's coming from.
TECH THREE: This can't be right. Tech Three just stares at his screen in disbelief.
SUPERVISOR: What's wrong?
TECH THREE: Calculated distance from source is at three hundred and eight five thousand kilometers. It's coming from the moon. The Supervisor reaches over and turns up the volume on the speaker. As they listen to the strange TONES we.
GENERAL GREY: Who else knows about this?
COMMANDING OFFICER: S.E.T.I. in New Mexico identified a signal but they're even more confused than we are. The General shoots him a disapproving glance.
COMMANDING OFFICER: Excuse me, Sir. He slides his security card through the lock and the doors fly INT. SPACE COMMAND - THE PENTAGON - CONTINUOUS Banks of computers, Technicians and assistants working feverishly through the night. The Officers cross the room. Super: SPACE COMMAND - THE PENTAGON
COMMANDING OFFICER: Satellite reception has been impaired but we were able to get They arrive at a glass table. The surrounding officers snap to attention as a SECOND OFFICER quickly brings over a large transparency. We SEE a grainy image of a large vague OBJECT.
GENERAL GREY: Looks like a big turd. The two Officers exchange a glance.
COMMANDING OFFICER: We estimate it has a diameter of over five hundred and fifty kilometers and a mass roughly one fourth the size of our moon. The General turns to the Second Officer, concerned.
GENERAL GREY: A meteor?
SECOND OFFICER: No Sir. Definitely not.
GENERAL GREY: How do you know?
SECOND OFFICER: Well, er. it's slowing down.
GENERAL GREY: It's doing what?
SECOND OFFICER: It's. slowing down, Sir. The General walks over to a phone, picks it up.
GENERAL GREY: Get me the Secretary of Defense. Then wake him up.
WOMAN'S VOICE: ( filtering through phone ) Hi. It's me. The warm look on Whitmore's face tells us everything about how he feels about the woman on the other end.
WHITMORE: Hi honey. What time is it there?
MARGARET: Two in the morning. I didn't wake you?
WHITMORE: ( filtered ) As a matter of fact you did.
MARGARET: ( smiles ) INT. WHITMORE BEDROOM - SAME Whitmore sits up.
WHITMORE: I have a confession to make. There's a beautiful young blonde sleeping next to me. Sleeping next to him, his six-year-old daughter, PATRICIA.
MARGARET: ( filtered ) You didn't let her stay up watching T.V. all night?
WHITMORE: Of course not. The little girl stirs awake, looks up.
PATRICIA: You're flying back right after the luncheon? Okay, here she is. Whitmore hands her the phone and gets out of bed. Habitably he turns on the television.
WHITMORE: You're flying back right after the luncheon? Okay, here she is. Whitmore hands her the phone and gets out of bed. Habitably he turns on the television.
PUNDIT #1: . the inexperience in public office was inevitably going to catch up with him. He's scarified his ideals for "politics as usual." Whitmore ties on his robe as he adjusts the picture quality.
PUNDIT #2: .I said this during the campaign. Leadership as a pilot in the Gulf War has no relationship to political leadership. It's a different Suddenly the channel changes. A cartoon comes on. Whitmore turns to his daughter who holds he remote.
PATRICIA: ( into phone ) Daddy let me watch Letterman.
WHITMORE: Whitmore exits the room.
SECURITY GUARD: Good morning, Mr. President.
WHITMORE: Good morning, George. The paper is dropped revealing CONSTANCE HALBROOK, mid- thirties, aggressive, sharp, the President's communications director. Quickly she gathers her things and follows INT. BREAKFAST TABLE - CONTINUOUS Two servants are preparing breakfast as Whitmore and Constance enter. Whitmore sits down, grabs a coffee.
WHITMORE: You're up early this morning, She tosses him one of the many newspapers in her hands.
CONSTANCE: They're not attacking your policies, they're attacking your ".addressing Congress, Whitmore seems less like the President and more like the orphan child Oliver asking, 'please sir, I'd like some Age was never an issue when you stuck to your gun. You were thought of as young and idealistic. But the message has gotten lost. There's too much compromise, too much politics.
WHITMORE: Age was never an issue when you stuck to your gun. You were thought of as young and idealistic. But the message has gotten lost. There's too much compromise, too much politics.
CONSTANCE: Age was never an issue when you stuck to your gun. You were thought of as young and idealistic. But the message has gotten lost. There's too much compromise, too much politics.
WHITMORE: ( pointedly ) Isn't it amazing how fast everyone can turn against you. Realizing she may be pushing him too far, she hands him another paper.
CONSTANCE: Well, the Orange County Register has named you one of the ten sexiest men of the year.
WHITMORE: You see, substance at last. An AIDE appears at the doorway.
CONSTANCE: Excuse me, Mr. President. It's the Secretary of Defense. Whitmore goes to the phone, picks it up.
WHITMORE: Yes? Say that again?
MOISHE: What are you waiting? My social security will expire, you'll still be sitting there.
DAVID: I'm thinking.
MOISHE: So think already. David makes a move. Instantly Moishe counters his move. David furls his brow in thought.
MOISHE: Again he's thinking. Moishe reaches into a paper bag and retrieves a coffee in a Styrofoam cup.
DAVID: You have any idea how long it takes for those things to You don't move soon. I'll begin to Just as David finally makes his move, Moishe counters again. David shoots him a look and stares back down to the board. David, I've been meaning to talk with you. It's nice you've been spending so much time with me, Dad, don't start.
MOISHE: You don't move soon. I'll begin to Just as David finally makes his move, Moishe counters again. David shoots him a look and stares back down to the board. David, I've been meaning to talk with you. It's nice you've been spending so much time with me, Dad, don't start.
DAVID: Dad, don't start.
MOISHE: I'm only saying, it's been what? Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers.
DAVID: Three years.
MOISHE: Three, four. Move on. It's not Moishe takes a big puff on the cigar and coughs.
DAVID: Look who's talking healthy. Suddenly David's beeper goes off.
MOISHE: How many times is that now? You trying to get fired? David moves his queen.
DAVID: Checkmate. See you tomorrow, Dad. He gives his father a quick kiss and hurries away.
MOISHE: still. Oh. You could let an old man win once in a while, it wouldn't kill you.
MARTY: What the hell is the point of having a beeper if you don't turn it on?
DAVID: It was you. What's the big emergency?
MARTY: Started this morning. Every channel is making like it's nineteen fifty. Snow, static, all kinds of distortions. No one knows what the hell is going on. David deposits his bike in the kitchenette as Marty tosses his coke bottle in the trash. David retrieves it.
DAVID: Damn it, Marty. There's a reason we have bins labeled "recycle." Finding more bottles in the trash, David turns to Marty What the hell is this?
DAVID: What the hell is this?
MARTY: So sue me. Before David can say anything, Marty ushers him out of the INT. TRANSMISSION FEED - CONTINUOUS Technicians are working feverishly. Clearly every monitor is experiencing varying degrees of signal disruption. David moves over to the main console.
DAVID: Did you try to switch to transponder channels?
MARTY: Please, would I be this panicked if it was that simple? David examines the readouts, puzzled.
DAVID: Let's retrofit the dish to another We've tried. It's not working. It's almost as though they weren't even there. David looks up, puzzled.
MARTY: We've tried. It's not working. It's almost as though they weren't even there. David looks up, puzzled.
DAVID: That's impossible.
MIGUEL: Stop it.
TROY: It's all fuzzy.
MIGUEL: You're gonna break it. Just leave it alone. Here, take your Miguel sits a small bottle of medicine and a spoon down in front of Troy. Troy pushes the bottle away.
TROY: I don't need it.
MIGUEL: ( pushing it back ) Just take it, dick head. ( turning to his sister ) Alicia! Make sure he takes his His sister, ALICIA, fourteen, hormones kicking in, testing boundaries, listens to her walkman while putting on too much makeup. Miguel throws a dish towel to get her as Troy hits the television again.
MIGUEL: Morning, Lucas. Lucas holds a bowl full of rotted vegetables.
LUCAS: You like these! I've got a whole goddamned crop full! Unceremoniously, he dumps them at Miguel's feet. Where the hell is your father? You know what time it is?
MIGUEL: He had to re-fuel. There musta been a problem.
LUCAS: We both know what the problem is. He's a damned nut case, is what he is. I musta been out of my mind. Troy SMACKS the television again.
MIGUEL: Troy, stop it! I swear to God!
LUCAS: Miguel, if he's not in the air in twenty minutes, that's it. I'm getting someone else. Lucas storms away. Again, Troy whacks at the television.
MIGUEL: Stop it, Troy! I swear to God! Determined, Troy HITS the television again. This time the picture goes out completely.
AIDE #1: CNN is running a story that we're covering up some kind of nuclear testing experiments.
CONSTANCE: Tell them to run with it if they want to embarrass themselves.
AIDE #2: NASA has been up my butt all morning. They want to know our Our official position is we don't have an official position.
CONSTANCE: Our official position is we don't have an official position.
AIDE #3: Connie, what the hell Constance escapes into the elevator, turns around.
CONSTANCE: ( smiles confidently ) Come on, people. Would I keep you guys out of the loop?
AIDE #1: In a second!
AIDE #2: Before she can retort, the elevator doors close.
NIMZIKI: What if it doesn't "pass us by?" Let's retarget some ICBMs to blow it out of the sky.
GENERAL GREY: Forgive me, but with the little information we do have, the only thing that would accomplish is turn one dangerous falling object into many. Just then the door opens and Constance enters.
PRESIDENT WHITMORE: What's the damage?
CONSTANCE: The press is making up their own stories at this point.
NIMZIKI: ( to General Grey ) Get on the horn with Atlantic Command. Let's upgrade the situation to DEFCON 3.
GENERAL GREY: That's not your call to make, Mr. Isn't that a little premature?
CONSTANCE: Isn't that a little premature?
NIMZIKI: I don't think so.
COMMANDING OFFICER: Our intelligence tells us the object has settled into a stationary orbit.
NIMZIKI: Well that's good news.
COMMANDING OFFICER: Not really. He lays out the diagrams and photos on the table. Everyone gathers around.
COMMANDING OFFICER: Part of it has broken off into nearly three dozen other pieces.
PRESIDENT WHITMORE: COMMANDING OFFICER Smaller than the whole, yet over fifteen miles in width themselves.
COMMANDING OFFICER: Smaller than the whole, yet over fifteen miles in width themselves.
NIMZIKI: Where are they heading?
COMMANDING OFFICER: They should be entering our atmosphere within the next twenty- five minutes. The room is silenced. All eyes turn to the President who says nothing. Nimziki leans in close to him.
NIMZIKI: Like it or not, we're at DEFCON 3. Recall the troops and put them on yellow alert.
MARTY: Please, tell me you're getting Marty enters, looking over David's shoulder as he eats.
DAVID: There's good news and bad news.
MARTY: What's the bad news?
DAVID: You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
MARTY: And the good news is you won't charge me.
DAVID: No. The good news is I found the problem and it's not our equipment. There's some weird signal embedded within the satellite feed.
MARTY: That's the David slides over to another computer and turns on an intricate computation program.
DAVID: Yes, because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it. When I find the exact binary sequence and I apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer I built you last Christmas, we should be able to block out the overlay completely.
MARTY: .and we'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture? That's my man.
MIGUEL: ( yelling ) Russell! God damn it, Russell! Looking down from the cockpit, RUSSELL BRENNON waves stupidly. Shaggy blonde hair and two days' growth, Russell is the image of a fifty-one-year-old little boy. Miguel follows him below, screaming at him. Russell, flying recklessly, looks down at Miguel not understanding. By the time he looks back he SEES.
MIGUEL: Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
RUSSELL: ( climbing down ) I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.
MIGUEL: It's the wrong field, you idiot! Lucas' farm is on the other side of town.
RUSSELL: You sure?
MIGUEL: Damn it, he was doing you a favor. You know how hard it is to find someone who doesn't think you're completely crazy?
LIEUTENANT: Ensign, status?
SAILOR #1: We have a total radar black out over a thirteen kilometer area. The Lieutenant moves over to the main radar screen. The entire upper portion of the screen is BLANK. And the blank area is MOVING.
LIEUTENANT: Have a complete diagnostic run.
SAILOR #1: Excuse me sir, radar may be malfunctioning but infrared is off the map! He diverts the Lieutenant's attention to another screen; A BRIGHT SEA OF RED light bleeds off the map.
LIEUTENANT: Get the CINC Atlantic Command on the line.
OFFICER: Sir, we now have visual range with incoming over Iraqi airspace.
COMMANDING OFFICER: A second sighting?
OFFICER: Yes Sir, this just came in from the Eisenhower. The Commanding Officer grabs a phone laying off the hook.
COMMANDING OFFICER: Correction, we have visual contacts. One over Iraq, one over the Pacific.
GENERAL GREY: Where in the Pacific? They've spotted one off the California coast line. Surrounded by the Secret Service, the President is speechless. Constance Halbrook comes rushing into the room and whispers to the President.
PRESIDENT: Put it on. Constance moves over to a cabinet and turns on the T.V. ( the reception is still fuzzy, picture "rolling" ). The CNN News broadcast shows the phenomenon over Novosibirsk, Russia. There is mass hysteria behind the reporter.
NEWSCASTER: ( filtered ) .sightings of this atmospheric phenomenon have been reported here in Novosibirsk, Russia and other parts of Siberia. Moving too slowly to be a comet or meteor, astronomers are baffled as to its Everyone is locked onto the television, mesmerized. ( filtered ) .Widespread panic has gripped the countryside as thousands have taken to the streets and clogged the highways. Hundreds have been General Grey confers with the Atlantic command CINC. He nods, turns to the President and whispers.
GENERAL GREY: Mr. President, we have an AWAC on the west coast. E.T.A. with contact point, three minutes.
PILOT: Negative. We still have EXT. AWAC AIRPLANE - CLOUDY SKIES - DAY ZOOMING overhead as we SEE the AWAC sailing through a thick cloudy sky. Super: Pacific Coastline, California The AWAC disappears from view into the clouds.
PILOT: ( filtered ) Instrumentation is malfunctioning. We can't get any kind of reading on what's in front of us.
PILOT: Wait a minute, it may be clearing. Suddenly the clouds part before us and we're face to face with a WALL OF FLAMES.
PILOT: ( filtered ) Jesus God! The sky's on fire!
GENERAL GREY: Get them back on line.
AIDE #1: ( on other phone ) Line's gone, sir. The ATLANTIC COMMAND CINC, turns from a different phone.
AAC CINC: Two more have been spotted over the Atlantic. One is moving toward New York, the other is headed this direction.
AAC CINC: Less than ten minutes.
NIMZIKI: ( turning to aid ) Organize a military escort to Crystal Mountain.
GENERAL GREY: ( to President ) Sir, I strongly recommend we move you to a secured location . The President hesitates, he turns to Constance.
PRESIDENT: Can we expect the same kid of panic here as in Russia?
CONSTANCE: More than likely.
NIMZIKI: Mr. President, you can discuss this on the way. Torn, the President grapples with a decision. Finally.
PRESIDENT: I'm not leaving.
NIMZIKI: We must maintain a working government in a time of crisis.
PRESIDENT: I want the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the whole Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs taken to a secured location. I'm staying here. I am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives.
NIMZIKI: But, Mr. President.
PRESIDENT: So far these things have not become hostile. For the moment let's assume they won't. Connie, let's issue statements advising people not to panic, to stay home and take cover. Constance issues commands to her staff as they quickly exit along with most people in the room. General Grey goes over to the President.
GENERAL GREY: With your permission, Mr. President, I'd like to remain my your side.
PRESIDENT: I had a feeling you would.
GENERAL GREY: Sir, what happens if they become hostile?
PRESIDENT: Then God help us.
DAVID: I've got a lock on the signal pattern. We can filter it out.
MARTY: ( distracted ) Huh? Oh, good, hood.
DAVID: Strange thing is, if my calculations are right it'll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway. The signal reduces itself every time it recycles. Eventually it will disappear. Are you listening?
MARTY: ( still glued to T.V. ) Can you believe this?
DAVID: What re you talking about?
MARTY: Haven't you been watching? David turns for the first time to the television and sees the phenomenon. Constance comes on addressing the press.
CONSTANCE: ( filtered ) .so far the phenomenon has not caused any damage. In all likelihood it won't.
CONSTANCE: .everyone should remain calm. Take cover where you can but the important thing is not to panic.
CONSTANCE: ( filtered ) .we have a fix on three different occurrences about to appear over American cities. One is headed toward Los Angeles.
CONSTANCE: ( filtered ) .the other two are on our Eastern seaboard headed towards New York and Washington, D.C. Suddenly hectic CO-WORKER #2 appear at the door.
MARTY: ( dry; to David ) Feel no shame in hiding.
MARTY: Oh shit, I better call my wife.
MECHANIC #1: Hey, Russ, heard you had a little trouble this morning. Dusted the wrong field? The Mechanics laugh. Russell tries to ignore them.
MECHANIC #2: I know, you're probably still a little confused from your hostage Hostage experience? Something happen to you, Russ?
MECHANIC #2: Hostage experience? Something happen to you, Russ?
MECHANIC #1: He ain't never told you!? Seems years back our boy here had been kidnapped by aliens. Did all kinds of experiments on him and such. Tell him, Russ.
RUSSELL: Not today, guys. Okay. Russell gets up and heads for the door.
MECHANIC #1: You just gotta get a couple more beers in him, he'll tell you all about it. Crazy stuff. Won't you, Russ?
MECHANIC #1: Hey, Russ, when they took you up in their space ship, they do any sexual things to you? The mechanics crack up laughing. Suddenly the things around them begin to RUMBLE. The SHADOW engulfs them, silencing the Panicked they turn and RUN AWAY. Russell just looks up at the sky, grabs his Jack Daniels and takes another swig.
DAVID: No way, I've got to
PRESIDENT WHITMORE: ( into phone ) Of course, Russia and the United States are in this together. Yes, Mr. President, you have my word. Yes, Das Vedanya. The President hangs up.
CONSTANCE: What is their position?
PRESIDENT WHITMORE: I think he was drunk. Patricia bursts through the door and runs into her father's arms, terrified. A SECRET SERVICE man appears.
DAVID: ( realizing ) My God. The signal.
HOUSEWIFE: Dylan, tell your mom you can stay overnight again Thursday. Suddenly a car SAILS over a nearby hill in front of them, hitting the ground with a BANG. Two more cars follows, air bound. As the Housewife turns she SEES.
DYLAN: Mommy, look at! He rushes away. The SHADOW moves past the window, darkening the room. His mother, JASMINE DUBROW, stirs.
JASMINE: ( re: darkness ) It's too early, baby. She turns back over. Suddenly the room briefly RUMBLES.
MAN: Not even a four pointer. Go back to sleep. Shrugging, the man does.
JASMINE: Not even a four pointer. Go back to sleep. Shrugging, the man does.
CONSTANCE: What do we do now?
PRESIDENT WHITMORE: Address the nation. There are a lot of very frightened people out there right now.
CONSTANCE: Yeah. I'm one of them.
JASMINE: He's trying to impress you.
STEVE: He's doing a good job. He pats the dog on the head and takes the shoes. Steven gets up and makes his way to the bathroom.
STEVE: Neighbors are moving. I think they're tired of earthquakes. He finished and flushes.
NEWSCASTER: .with little damage reported to the southland area. People are advised not to panic.
STEVE: Hon, something's on the table 'bout the quake. Jasmine sits up in bed, yelling out to Steve.
JASMINE: Dylan out there? Steve turns, looking for Dylan when the doggie door pops open and Dylan crawls through.
STEVE: What have you been up to, Sport?
DYLAN: ( holding his gun ) Shooting aliens. Steve musses up the boy's hair, smiling.
JASMINE: ( entering ) Steve mumbles an affirmative as he exits.
WOLF BLITZER: Pentagon officials are reporting more ships have just arrived over the capitals of India, England and As he speaks we get quick glimpses of the other ships.
DAVID: Tell her to get the kids and leave What happened?
MARTY: What happened?
DAVID: ( yells ) Just do it! Marty realizes David is dead serious.
MARTY: Babycakes, pack the kids up and take them to your mother's. Don't ask. Go. Mary hangs up, crawls out from under the table. Okay, why did I just send my family to Atlanta?
DAVID: Remember I told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to Not really.
MARTY: Not really.
DAVID: That signal. It's a
MARTY: ( confused ) A countdown to what?
DAVID: Think. It's like in chess. First you strategically position your pieces. Then, when the timing's right. You strike. David motions to the television.
BLITZER: .there are additional unconfirmed sightings over Japan, the Mediterranean, and China.
DAVID: They are positioning themselves all over the world and using this one signal to synchronize their efforts. In approximately six hours the signal will disappear and the countdown will be over.
MARTY: Then what?
DAVID: Marty takes a beat to digest. Then, grabbing the phone..
MARTY: I gotta call my brother, my bookie, my lawyer. fuck my David also grabs a phone. Suddenly the bank of monitors synchronize into one enormous image across the entire video wall; the President addressing the nation.
PRESIDENT WHITMORE: My fellow Americans, a historic and unprecedented event has taken place. The question as to whether or not we are alone in the universe has been answered.
PRESS AIDE: He says he's your husband. Her expression drops. She takes the phone from her.
CONSTANCE: What do you want?
DAVID: ( filtered ) You have to leave the White House.
CONSTANCE: This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.
DAVID: You don't understand. You have to leave Washington.
CONSTANCE: In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here.
DAVID: ( filtered ) I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to You're being paranoid.
CONSTANCE: You're being paranoid.
DAVID: ( filtered ) It's not paranoia. The embedding is very subtle. It's probably been overlooked. Constance hangs up. Her face betrays mixed emotions.
PRESIDENT WHITMORE: ( filtered ) .My staff and I are remaining here at the White House while we attempt to establish Hanging up the phone, David sprints for the exit. .so remain calm. If you are compelled to leave these cities, please do so in a safe and orderly CABS SLAMMING TOGETHER - NEW YORK CITY STREETS The rush to get away creeps slowly as cars jam the streets in total grid-lock. David pedals his bike furiously through EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - NEW YORK - DAY The mass exodus has reached the bridge. Total congestion. David fights his way through.
DAVID: The television said they've started with the looting already You still got the Olds?
MOISHE: The television said they've started with the looting already You still got the Olds?
DAVID: You still got the Olds?
MOISHE: You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.
DAVID: That's okay. You're driving.
JASMINE: You can't go. Call them back.
STEVE: Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
JASMINE: You said you were on leave for the They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this? Jasmine grabs the blinds and yanks them away. We SEE the alien craft through the window.
STEVE: They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this? Jasmine grabs the blinds and yanks them away. We SEE the alien craft through the window.
JASMINE: Why? That's why. That thing scares the piss out of me.
STEVE: Here. I got these for you. Be careful with them. Dylan opens the bag; fireworks. Jasmine walks over.
DYLAN: Steve tosses his gear into the back, opens his door.
JASMINE: Wait. I have to tell you Be careful.
STEVE: ( loses her nerve ) Be careful.
JASMINE: ( loses her nerve ) Be careful.
STEVE: Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me on base.

JASMINE: I'll take these.
DYLAN: CUT TO: EXT. JERSEY - HIGHWAY - LATER THAT DAY A perfectly preserved '68 Olds drives cautiously down the highway. Around him we see other cars packed to the gills as they make their escape from New York.
MOISHE: It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell.
DAVID: Can't this thing go any faster?
MOISHE: You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.
DAVID: They don't know this.
MOISHE: And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable All I'm saying is they've got people who handle these things, David. They want HBO, they'll call you.

MOISHE: All I'm saying is they've got people who handle these things, David. They want HBO, they'll call you.
PRESIDENT WHITMORE: ( filtered through phone ) I want you out of there.
MARGARET: You're staying there to keep people calm. It's the right thing to do. I'm not going to let them criticize you for it.
PRESIDENT WHITMORE: Okay, fine but the second your interviews are done, I have a helicopter ready to take you to Nellis Air Force.
MARGARET: ( filtered ) How's the munchkin?
PRESIDENT WHITMORE: She's glued to the T.V., just like the rest of the world. I love you too. Here she is. He hands Patty the phone as General Grey and Nimziki appear in the doorway. The President walks over to them.
GENERAL GREY: More ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far.
NIMZIKI: This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
GENERAL GREY: We're trying to communicate with them on all frequencies but we're getting nowhere. Atlantic Command is working on a type of visual What the hell are they up to?
PRESIDENT WHITMORE: What the hell are they up to?
REPORTER: ( filtered ) .a local crop duster was arrested today attempting to land at Edwards Air Force Base. On the T.V. we SEE Russell being escorted to a police car. Mortified, Miguel can't believe what he's seeing.
RUSSELL: They've got to do something. I was abducted by space aliens ten years ago. They did all kinds of experiments on me. They've been studying us for years, learning our weakness. We've go to do something before they kill us all!
MRS. WHITMORE: ( filtered ) .we need to remain calm. As more people decide to leave the cities, safety is key.
MIGUEL: Troy, you remember Uncle Hector, from Tucson?
TROY: He's got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit, right?
MIGUEL: Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
TROY: That'd be cool! Miguel thinks for a second, makes a decision.
MIGUEL: Pack up, we're going. Miguel jumps down from the roof. Troy climbs down the ladder.
TROY: ( yelling after him ) What about Dad?
OLDER BOY: This could be our last night on Earth. You don't want to die a virgin, do you?
ALICIA: What makes you think I'm a virgin? The Older Boy is taken off guard. Before he can answer the tarp they were hiding under is ripped away. Miguel stands Come on, we're going.
MIGUEL: Come on, we're going.
ALICIA: I'm not going anywhere. Miguel grabs her by the wrist and pulls her away.
MOISHE: The whole world is trying to get out of Washington and we're the only schmucks trying to get in. As Moishe drives, David distracts him as he unpacks his backpack unloading his laptop. He grabs a CD. What the hell is that?
DAVID: This, pops, is every phone book in You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
MOISHE: You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
DAVID: She always keeps her portable phone listed, for emergencies. Sometimes it's just her first initial, sometime her nickname. David starts to look it up. Suddenly.
MOISHE: Oh my God! Moishe SWERVES violently to avoid collision, barely missing the oncoming traffic. Dodging right to left, Moishe hangs on for dear life. A Military Office, assisting in diverting the cars turns just in time to see the Olds whiz by. David and Moishe are bounded around the inside of the car as Moishe tries to veer through traffic. Suddenly A TRUCK blocks off their only escape route. Moishe turns HARD and drives up onto the right shoulder.
DAVID: Nice driving, pops! Dangerously close to a heart attack, Moishe is, for once, at a loss for words. Over their adrenaline pumped faces.
NEWSCASTERS: ( filtered ) .from the "it could only happen in California" file, hundreds of UFO fanatics have gathered on the rooftops of downtown Los Angeles, welcoming the new arrivals.
JASMINE: I can't believe I even came in tonight. What was I thinking?
TIFFANY: ( re: T.V. ) Isn't this cool? And you thought I was nuts. Oh, look, I brought mine with me. Tiffany holds up a drawing of a space alien.
JASMINE: You're not thinking of joining those idiots?
TIFFANY: I'm going over there soon as I'm off. Wanna come? Jasmine turns to Tiffany, dead serious.
JASMINE: Tiffany, I don't want you to go up there. Promise me you won't. I promise.
TIFFANY: I promise.
JASMINE: Okay. I'm gone. I'm outta town for a while. Her boss MARIO enters and walks over to his private office in back. He opens the door and finds Dylan playing with his dog, What the hell's your kid doing Jasmine rushes past picking up Dylan and carrying him away as she heads for the exit. Boomer follows.
MARIO: What the hell's your kid doing Jasmine rushes past picking up Dylan and carrying him away as she heads for the exit. Boomer follows.
JASMINE: You try to find a sitter today.
MARIO: Where do you think you're going? You leave, you're fired.
JASMINE: ( out the door ) Nice working with you, Mario.
MOISHE: Not listed, huh?
DAVID: I just haven't found it yet. I tried C. Halbrook, Connie Halbrook, Spunky Halbrook.
MOISHE: College nickname.
DAVID: College nickname.
MOISHE: You try Martin?
DAVID: She didn't take my name when we were married. Moishe shrugs. David gives it a shot. Finds it. The machine
MOISHE: ( sarcastic ) So what do I know?
STEVE: Ah, were you guys waiting for me? Several Marines throws towels at Steve as he makes his way to his locker. His best friend, JIMMY, sits next to him.
JIMMY: Can you believe it? This is serious shit, Stevie. They've recalled everyone! As Steve sits he SEES some envelops stuck into the side of his Well, the mail's still working. He flips through the envelops and FREEZES when he sees one with the NASA insignia on it. Jimmy snatches it away from Junk mail. You don't want this. Steve quickly snatches it back, right it open and reads. From the disappointment on his face we can tell it's bad news. Realizing, Jimmy puts a hand on Steve's shoulder.
STEVE: Well, the mail's still working. He flips through the envelops and FREEZES when he sees one with the NASA insignia on it. Jimmy snatches it away from Junk mail. You don't want this.

JIMMY: Junk mail. You don't want this. Steve quickly snatches it back, right it open and reads. From the disappointment on his face we can tell it's bad news. Realizing, Jimmy puts a hand on Steve's shoulder.
JIMMY: I don't believe it. They make you learn how to fly everything from an Apache to a Harrier and still they turn you down? What else do they want you to learn?
STEVE: How to kiss ass. Steve crumples at the letter and tosses it. Angrily he opens his locker. Pasted on the locker door we see photos of Jasmine next to the photos of the space shuttle, Apollo Missions, and a NASA insignia bumper sticker. As Steve stuffs his jacket into the locker, something falls out. Before Steve can grab it, Jimmy snatches it up first.
JIMMY: ( embarrassed ) Jasmine has this thing for dolphins. I had them make it.
STEVE: I thought you said you were doing to break it off. Steve snatches it back, embarrassed. Steve, listen to me, you're never gonna get to fly the space shuttle if you marry a stripper. Steve knows he's right. He's torn.
MOISHE: So, you want to ring the bell or should I? David flips open the phone, dials the number on the screen.
DAVID: Perfect, she's using it.
MOISHE: It's perfect the line is busy?
DAVID: Yes. I can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House.
MOISHE: You can do that? Shooting his father a look.
DAVID: ( sarcastic ) All cable repairmen can.
CONSTANCE: .Sally, take my cat with when you leave. No I'm staying here at the White House. Take care. The moment she hangs up, it RINGS. Surprised, she answers.
CONSTANCE: ( filtered ) Connie, don't hang up.
DAVID: ( filtered ) Connie, don't hang up.
CONSTANCE: David? How'd you get this number?
DAVID: Walk to the window. Right in front of you. Constance looks up to the large glass windows. She walks over to it, looking out.
CONSTANCE: What am I looking for?
CONSTANCE: ( to herself ) How does he do that?
MIGUEL: They let you out?
RUSSELL: Just what the hell do you think you're doing? Miguel moves to meet Russell away from the trailer, not wanting the others to hear.
MIGUEL: We're leaving, don't try and stop You're not going anywhere. You hear me? I'm still your father. Miguel explodes, this has been building up for some time.
RUSSELL: You're not going anywhere. You hear me? I'm still your father. Miguel explodes, this has been building up for some time.
MIGUEL: No, you're not! You're just the man who married my mother. You're nothing to me! Russell is momentarily silent, stunned. Recovering.
RUSSELL: Troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me.
MIGUEL: For once in your life think about what's best for Troy. Who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up? Who? Suddenly we hear glass CRASHING. Both men spin to find Troy standing behind them.
TROY: Stop it! I'm not a baby! I don't need your stupid medicine. I don't need anyone to take care of Miguel leans down to see the broken MEDICINE BOTTLE on the floor. Miguel rushes over to him, furious.
MIGUEL: You know what this stuff costs? Do you want to get sick again!? Do you!? Frustrated, Miguel shoves Troy aside and heads back into the trailer. Wobbly from the drinking, Russell stands there pathetically, watching.
CNN REPORTER: What you see behind me are four Apache helicopters.
CNN REPORTER: ( filtered through T.V. ) .each has been refitted with what Pentagon officially hope will be our first step in communicating with the alien craft. We WIDEN to reveal a large contingent of military personnel along with the President's chief advisors gathered around several monitors, ( the center monitors are momentarily blank ). Suddenly everyone snaps to attention as the President enters.
PRESIDENT: Where are we?
GENERAL GRAY: They're in the air.
MOISHE: ( to himself ) Very nice. Constance is looking at David's laptop displaying the breakdown of the alien signal.
CONSTANCE: And when is the countdown supposed to expire?
DAVID: ( checking ) Fifty six minutes, forty five Constance runs her fingers through her hair, exasperated. Moishe turns, listens.
CONSTANCE: What do you want me to do?
DAVID: I want you to leave with us. Right now.
CONSTANCE: I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
DAVID: He's not going to listen to me. Surprised at his son, Moishe steps forward.
MOISHE: Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
DAVID: Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
MOISHE: You punched the President in the He wasn't the President then.
DAVID: He wasn't the President then.
CONSTANCE: David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
MOISHE: Punched the President? Oh my god.
APACHE HELICOPTERS: ZOOM by overhead. In the distance we see they are headed for the enormous alien craft.
PILOT: Echo one, we are closing in.
MOISHE: If I had known I was going to meet the President, I'd a worn a tie. Look at me, I look like a INT. OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS The Office is empty as the trio walks in. Moishe can't believe he's in there. He straightens himself up, combs his Wait here. I'll be right back. David sets up his laptop.
CONSTANCE: Wait here. I'll be right back. David sets up his laptop.
MOISHE: Not on his desk.
NEWSCASTER: ( filtered ) .the helicopters are making their final approach. On the middle monitor, through the night vision camera on the lead helicopter we SEE the side of the craft as the helicopters near. Everyone in the room watches, tense. Constance enters and kneels down next to the President, whispering in his ear. The President gets up and follows Constance. Chief of Staff Nimziki objects.
NIMZIKI: You're leaving The President silences him with a look. As they exit.
CONSTANCE: I don't know how you put up with He used to run the NASA. He knows where all the bones are buried. Comes in handy.
PRESIDENT: He used to run the NASA. He knows where all the bones are buried. Comes in handy.
CONSTANCE: I'll bet.
PRESIDENT: What the hell's he doing here? Moishe, bursting, steps forward.
MOISHE: Moishe Martinsburg, Mr. President.
CONSTANCE: My ex-husband works in satellite I don't have time for this. With a BANG, David suddenly KNOCKS everything off the President's desk and starts to draw on the ink blotter.
PRESIDENT: I don't have time for this. With a BANG, David suddenly KNOCKS everything off the President's desk and starts to draw on the ink blotter.
DAVID: It's about "Line o sight," Mr. David draws a circle representing Earth and a smaller circle just away from it. The President reluctantly nears.
DAVID: .If you wanted t coordinate with ships all over the world, you couldn't send one signal to every place at the same time. That's called line of sight. Drawing a line from the ship of either side of the Earth, we SEE that you could not send a signal to the other side. .you'd need to relay your signal using satellites. David draws small satellites surrounding Earth. .to reach each ship. I have found a signal hidden inside our own satellite network. Suddenly an aide, ALEX, appears in the doorway.
ALEX: Excuse me, Mr. President. They're The President turns to the monitor in his office. We SEE the helicopters turning on the light boards affixed to the front of their cockpits. He turns back to David.
DAVID: Mr. President, they are using our own satellites against us and the clock is ticking.
PRESIDENT: General Grey, co-ordinate with Atlantic Command. Tell them they have twenty five minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can.
GENERAL GREY: But Mr. President.
PRESIDENT: And get those helicopters away from the ship. Call them back General Grey obeys, turning to an assistant who quickly grabs a phone. Nimziki steps up to the President.
NIMZIKI: What the hell's going on?
PRESIDENT: We're leaving. An AIDE motions to the monitors.
AIDE: They're responding. The room goes silent, everyone turns to the monitors. MONITOR - NEWS PROGRAM & NIGHT VISION VIDEO On all screens we SEE the space ship as a long thin line of WHITE LIGHT suddenly emits from the side of the craft, illuminating the four Apache Helicopters.
SECRET SERVICEMAN: Mrs. Whitmore? The President has ordered the evacuation. We have to leave, now. She slams her valise SHUT and quickly exits.
POLICE HELICOPTER: SOARS over us, headed directly for downtown Los Angeles.
TIFFANY: ( awed ) It's beautiful. She digs her drawing of an alien out of her purse as she excitedly rushes up to the others. She holds it up to the sky, proudly.
POLICE HELICOPTER: From out of nowhere the helicopter LIFTS up over the side of the building, shining its spotlight down the believers The sign holders begin to "boo" the police, ignoring them.
RADIO VOICE: .authorities have called for a complete evacuation of Los Angeles County. People are advised to avoid the highways whenever Now he tells me.
JASMINE: Now he tells me.
PRESIDENT: They're okay. Let them on!
PRESIDENT: Is my wife in the air?
GENERAL GREY: She should be shortly. David flips open his laptop which reads: 09:07. 09:96.
BELIEVERS: Take me! No, take me! Take me! Slowly, this beam of light from the base of the ship INTENSIFIES directly on the top of this building.
SECRET SERVICEMAN: ( yelling over helicopter ) Mrs. Whitmore! Reluctantly, the First Lady turns and runs for the helicopter. The door is shut and the helicopter takes off.
THE PENTAGON: Washed under the WALL OF DESTRUCTION, the Pentagon, too, is blown to smithereens.
RADIO NEWSMAN: ( filtered ) .My God. It's destroying everything in its path. Suddenly the radio CUTS OUT. Jasmine turns around and SEES. JASMINE'S POV - FREEWAY & DOWNTOWN Far off the devastation of downtown can be seen. The WALL OF DESTRUCTION growing towards us. Reacting, Jasmine grabs Dylan and dashes out of the car. Boomer follows. Every drivers who can, jumps out of their cars, running in all directions. Jasmine heads for the tunnel.
JASMINE: Boomer, come. Come boy! Boomer LEAPS inside and Jasmine ducks to the side of the WALL OF DESTRUCTION hits the tunnel entrance, cars are JAMMED TOGETHER, SMASHING into one another. Suddenly the car ARE BLOWN CLEAR THROUGH THE TUNNEL like so many toy Hot Wheel cars. Inside the Maintenance alcove, Jasmine shields Dylan and Boomer with her body.
RADIO: ( filtered ) .reports are unclear as to the extent of the devastation, but from all accounts, Los Angeles, Washington and New York have been left in ruins. Russell shoots a worried look over to Miguel. Suddenly Troy moves up to the front on wobbly legs.
TROY: Guys, I don't feel so good.
RUSSELL: When was the last time you had your medicine?
TROY: Four days. five? Troy looks really sick. Miguel is shocked.
MIGUEL: But I gave you some this morning.
TROY: I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.
RUSSELL: Miguel? Come take a look at this. Reluctantly Miguel leaves his brother's side.
WATSON: You will be the first wave in our counter attack. Though surveillance satellite reconnaissance has been impaired, we have a fix on our primary Steve and Jimmy sit next to each other near the back of the You won't exactly need radar to find it. Jimmy chuckles. Watson is annoyed.
STEVE: ( whispered ) You won't exactly need radar to find it. Jimmy chuckles. Watson is annoyed.
WATSON: You want to add something to this briefing, Lt. Hill? Steve smiles confidently.
STEVE: Sorry, Sir. Just real anxious to kick some alien ass. Everyone chuckles, including Captain Watson.
ENGINE BLAST: The heat waves momentarily obscure our view as the F/A-18s take to the air.
CONSTANCE: You saved a lot of lives.
PRESIDENT: I could have evacuated the cities hours ago. You know, when I flew in the Gulf War everything is simple. We knew what we had to do. It's not simple anymore, Connie. A lot of people died today. How many didn't have to? Constance realizes there's no comforting him. She supports him silently by being there. General Grey comes over.
PRESIDENT: Any news on my wife?
GENERAL GREY: The helicopter never arrived at Nellis and there's been no radio The news rocks the President. They both know what that means. The fighters are in the air. Whitmore nods and follows the General to the back of the COMMAND CENTER - AIR FORCE ONE Military Command has been set up on Air Force One, a kind of flying NORAD. Military and technical crew are seated at the controls. Nimziki is already there.
GENERAL GREY: All satellites, microwave and ground communications with the cities are gone. We believe we're looking at a total loss. Maintaining his composure, the President looks up at the many tracking screens.
PRESIDENT: Where are they?
GENERAL GREY: ( pointing ) ETA with target; four minutes.
STEVE: ( into radio ) Jimmy crack corn, do you have victory dance?
JIMMY: ( into radio ) That is an affirmative. I have victory dance. Mmmmmmm.
STEVE: ( filtered ) Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
JIMMY: I hear you.
MOISHE: It's Air Force One for crying out loud. Still he gets sick?
DAVID: Moishe, please, don't talk. Moishe pats his belly.
MOISHE: Look at me, like a rock. Good weather, bad, doesn't matter. We can go up and down, back and forth, side to side. David can't take any more of this story and takes off running for the bathroom.
MOISHE: What I say? Constance comes over, sits next to Moishe.
CONSTANCE: He still gets air sick, huh? In all of this I didn't get the chance to thank you two.
MOISHE: Think nothing of it, Spanky. Constance smiles, corrects him.
CONSTANCE: Spunky. He told you about that?
MOISHE: ( nods ) All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.
CONSTANCE: ( sadly ) Love was never our problem.
MOISHE: All you need is love. John Lennon. Smart man. Shot in the back, very sad.
STEVE: I shouldn't have left her.
JIMMY: ( filtered ) Don't worry, big guy. I'm sure she got out of here before it Steve nods absently.
STEVE: Let's lock and load.
TECHNICIAN: Los Angeles attack squadron has AMRAAM missiles locked on target.
TECHNICIAN #2: Washington and New York squadrons, reporting lock on.
GENERAL GREY: Fire at will.
STEVE: Damn it!
JIMMY: ( filtered ) I didn't even see them fire!
STEVE: Command, Eagle One. Switching to "sidewinders." We're moving in.
STEVE'S GROUP: The first attack group, Steve's, are the first to near the colossal alien craft. Simultaneously they drop their AIM-9 sidewinder missiles.
STEVE: They must have some kind of protective shield surrounding their hull. Pull up. Most of the fighters do, but one is too late and SMASHES into the ship's protective shield.
STEVE: ( filtered ) Evasive maneuvers! Check Six! Just moving away in time, our Fighters barely dodge the oncoming enemy Attackers as they FIRE a HAILSTORM of FIREPOWER ( tracker bullet-like lasers ) showering the sky. As Steve's plane DIVES, an Attacker follows. Jimmy's plane pulls up behind the attacker.
JIMMY: ( filtered ) Got you covered, Stevie. Jimmy FIRES, another AIM-9 Sidewinder TAKES OFF.
ALIEN ATTACKER: The Sidewinder overtakes the attacker as Steve ROLLS AWAY out of position. Five yards before the sidewinder can get to the Attacker, it EXPLODES.
JIMMY: Shit! They've got shield too.
STEVE'S FIGHTER: Banks back around to get a shot. Just as he turns, three American Fighters are BLOWN TO RIBBONS from Attacker tracer The Attackers are in hot pursuit of Jimmy's fighter. The Fighter flying next to Jimmy is DEMOLISHED.
STEVE: Jimmy, roll right. I'll cover. Jimmy's fighter narrowly rolls away from the tracer fire as Steve fires another Sidewinder, momentarily distracting the Jimmy falls in line with Steve as the attackers turn on them. Both fighters jerk downwards at a ninety degree angle at MACH ONE. Narrowly missing the ground, they bank away. The Attackers can't follow.
CONSTANCE: We're losing them.
PRESIDENT: Then get them out of there. Suddenly one of the large radar display maps FIZZLES OUT.
TECHNICIAN: We've lost the satellite. Before he can adjust, another monitor FIZZLES AWAY.
STEVE: Maybe we can out run them. Follow my lead. Jimmy and Steve bank away from the craft, hit the supercruise, BOLTING AWAY at Mach 2. Both Jimmy and Steve are held tight against their seats, straining against the G-Force. Two Attackers spot them and follow in hot pursuit. Steve and Jimmy are flying at breakneck speeds, the attackers slowly gaining on them.
STEVE: Jimmy, kick it! They're gaining.
JIMMY: We're already over Mach 2!
STEVE: So push it! Readouts show the planes flying beyond measurement.
JIMMY: Stevie. I can't.
STEVE: Jimmy, stay with me. Jimmy slowly loses consciousness. His fighter slows, drifting off to the right.
STEVE: ALIEN ATTACKERS gain on them. One catches up with Jimmy's fighter and FIRES.
JIMMY!: ALIEN ATTACKERS gain on them. One catches up with Jimmy's fighter and FIRES.
ALIEN ATTACKERS: gain on them. One catches up with Jimmy's fighter and FIRES.
JIMMY'S FIGHTER: Laser-tracers SHOWER the Fighter. It EXPLODES. Job done, his Attacker banks away, returning to Los Angeles.
STEVE: Steve's Attacker stays right with him, slowly gaining. Steve kicks his harder, keeping the distance.
OPERATOR: We have incoming.
WATSON: I don't think so. Watson hits an alarm which ROARS.
OPERATOR: I don't think so. Watson hits an alarm which ROARS.
STEVE: ( to himself ) Okay, jerk-off. Let's have some The Attacker recovers, dives after Steve who flies dangerously close to the canyon walls. The Attacker has trouble keeping up with him but does. Steve puts on a clinic in advanced aerobatics, banking, diving, swerving. The Attacker seems to be improving, following closer and Steve ducks into smaller canyons, twisting sideways. Still the Attacker follows close.
STEVE: Damn it! Steve turns down a dead and side canyon. The Attacker is right on his tail.
STEVE: Let's see if you're fully The Fighter is on a collision course with the end of the canyon wall. Suddenly Steve yanks his ACES II - EJECTION
AN ALIEN: For the first time we get a quick glance at these aliens, an odd hybrid creature with fluctuating skeletal structure. The reason we only get a quick glance is because the moment it turns woozily towards us, Steve rears back and SLUGS HIM IN THE FACE, knocking the alien totally unconscious. His anger finally subsiding, exhaustion taking over, Steve stands over the craft, slowly withdrawing the prized Victory Dance cigar. He lights it and takes a long angry puff.
STEVE: Now that's a close encounter.
DYLAN: Mommy, what happened?
JASMINE: ( astonished ) I don't know, badly.
RUSSELL: You know, you're just like your mother. She was stubborn too. I had to twist her arm to get her to take her medicine.
TROY: I'm sorry, Dad. I'm not goin to die like mom, am
I?: You're going to be fine. Miguel comes rushing in, pulls Russell aside.
ALICIA: You're going to be fine. Miguel comes rushing in, pulls Russell aside.
MIGUEL: I couldn't find anything. Everyone is packing up, they're leaving. Word is a space ship is heading this way.
RUSSELL: We should leave too.
MIGUEL: There's a group heading south, they said there's a hospital just a couple hours away. I think we should follow them. Russell nods in agreement. A knock on the door. Alicia turns to find a handsome young boy, PHILIP in the doorway holding a bottle of pills.
PHILIP: Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.
ALICIA: It's really nice of you to help I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
PHILIP: I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
ALICIA: ( too eager ) We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
PHILIP: Alicia nods, smitten. Philip smiles charmingly and leaves.
TECHNICIAN: They must be targeting our satellites. We've lost all satellite communication, tracking and mapping.
GENERAL GREY: Have NORAD relay intelligence to our on board computers? The Technician nods and exits. Defeated, the President slumps We've moved as many of our forces away from the bases as possible but we've already sustained heavy The President nods his approval absently. Coming out of the bathroom, David overhears.
GENERAL GREY: We've moved as many of our forces away from the bases as possible but we've already sustained heavy The President nods his approval absently. Coming out of the bathroom, David overhears.
NIMZIKI: I spoke with the Joint Chief when they arrived at NORAD. They agree, we must launch a counter offensive with a full nuclear strike. Hit 'em with everything we've got.
PRESIDENT: Above American soil?
NIMZIKI: If we don't strike soon, there may not be much of an America left to The Technician returns, his face is white with fear.
GENERAL GREY: What's the latest from NORAD?
OFFICER: It's gone, sir. They've taken out
NIMZIKI: That's impossible.
GENERAL GREY: My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs.
NIMZIKI: Mr. President, we must launch. A delay now would be more costly than when you waited to evacuate the cities! That stings the President. He considers the option. David is You can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?
DAVID: You can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?
CONSTANCE: David, don't. David pushes past her.
DAVID: If you fire nukes, so will the rest of the world. Do you know what that kind of fall out will do? How many innocent people. The General gets up running interference. Constance tries to pull David back.
GENERAL GREY: ( stern ) Sir, i remind you that you are just a guest here.
CONSTANCE: ( overlapping ) David, please.
DAVID: This is insanity! You'll kill us and them at the same time. There'll be nothing left!
NIMZIKI: ( interrupting ) Sit down and shut up! Suddenly Moishe is on his feet, interrupting.
MOISHE: Don't tell him to shut up! You'd all be dead, were it not for my David. You didn't do anything to prevent this! As everyone is about to besiege Moishe, the President tries to calm him down.
PRESIDENT: Sir, there wasn't much more we could have done. We were totally unprepared for this.
MOISHE: Don't give me unprepared! Since nineteen fifty whatever you guys have had that space ship, the thing you found in New Mexico.
DAVID: ( embarrassed ) Dad, please.
MOISHE: What was it, Roswell? You had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, Area fifty one. That's it! Area fifty one. You knew and you didn't do nothing! For the first time in along time, President Whitmore smiles.
PRESIDENT: Regardless of what the tabloids have said, there were never any space crafts recovered by the government. Take my word for it, there is no Area 51 and no recovered space ship. Chief of Staff Nimziki suddenly clears his throat.
NIMZIKI: Uh, excuse me, Mr. President, but that's not entirely accurate. The President and General Grey turn to Nimziki, shocked.
TALL MAN: The end has come! He speaketh his word and the end hast come! Jasmine pulls up along side him.
JASMINE: Hop on. We're heading out to El You cannot defy what has come, it is the end! The tall man moves off, screaming to the heavens. As Jasmine watches him drift away she SEES.
TALL MAN: You cannot defy what has come, it is the end! The tall man moves off, screaming to the heavens. As Jasmine watches him drift away she SEES.
JASMINE: Give me a hand. Teddy joins Jasmine as they pry open the door. Inside, the pilots have been killed, but Mrs. Whitmore, THE FIRST LADY, lays there in great pain, blood across her blouse.
JASMINE: Let's get her out of here. They erase her from the wreckage, laying her on the ground. Dylan comes over, standing next to his mother.
TEDDY: She's bleeding pretty bad. Suddenly we HEAR the CLICKING of a rifle COCKING.
REDNECK: ( yelling to pals ) Looks like I've solved our transportation problem.
JASMINE: Hey, you're welcome to come with us. We're leaving here anyway.
REDNECK: We're not. Give me the key. Get 'em off. Two GUYS rush from their vehicle over to the maintenance truck, pulling the injured off the tailback.
REDNECK: Back off. This ain't your As the Redneck is distracted, Jasmine spots the bag of fireworks protruding out of Dylan's back pocket.
TALL MAN: You cannot go against the word, Sure I can. The Redneck SHOOTS the Tall Man. His buddies laugh. Now give me that key, bitch. As he turns back to Jasmine, Boomer starts BARKING wildly. Just as he turns to shoot the dog, Jasmine lights a key ROCKET from the fireworks bag. The rocket BLASTS into the Redneck, his shirt IGNITING ON FIRE. The Redneck drops the rifle, attempting to put out the flames, his cronies rush to his aid. Jasmine picks up the gun, moves in on them.

JASMINE: This "bitch" was born in Alabama with a Daddy who loved to hunt. So don't think for one second that I don't know how to use this. She FIRES the rifle. Quickly the rednecks scamper away.
MIGUEL: ( sarcastic ) Need a lift?
STEVE: When I flew overhead, I saw some kind of base, not far. Confused, Miguel checks his map.
MIGUEL: It's not on the map.
STEVE: Trust me, it's there.
PRESIDENT: Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?
NIMZIKI: Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability. General Grey shoots Nimziki a pissed off look. When the elevator stops, a door SLIDES open.
PRESIDENT: I don't understand. Where did all this come from? How did this get You didn't think they actually spent ten thousand dollars for a hammer and thirty thousand for a toilet seat, did you? The President shoots him a look. They are greeted by a group of SCIENTISTS in whit coats led by, DR. OKUN.
MOISHE: You didn't think they actually spent ten thousand dollars for a hammer and thirty thousand for a toilet seat, did you? The President shoots him a look. They are greeted by a group of SCIENTISTS in whit coats led by, DR. OKUN.
MITCHELL: Mr. President, I'd like to introduce you to Dr. Okun. He's been heading up our research here for the last fifteen years. Dr. Okun is an odd, hyper-energetic man who's spent too much time in isolation.
OKUN: Mr. President, a real pleasure. They don't let us out much, you Well, I guess you'd like to see the big tamale? Follow me. They walk up a ramp at the end of the room. Large heavily enforced doors SLIDE open.
PRESIDENT: ( uncomfortable ) Well, I guess you'd like to see the big tamale? Follow me. They walk up a ramp at the end of the room. Large heavily enforced doors SLIDE open.
OKUN: Well, I guess you'd like to see the big tamale? Follow me. They walk up a ramp at the end of the room. Large heavily enforced doors SLIDE open.
OKUN: She's a beaut, ain't she? Moishe leans close to David and Constance.
MOISHE: ( smug ) Never any space ships recovered by the government, huh?
PRESIDENT: We've had this for forty years and you don't know anything about Hell no, we know tons about them. The nearest stuff has only happened in the last few days. The President slowly walks around the ship as Okun talks. David, mouth agape, just stares at it. See, we can't duplicate their type of power so we've never been able to experiment. But since these guys started showing up, all the gizmos inside turned on. The last twenty four hours have been really People are dying out there. I don't think "exciting" is the word I'd choose to describe it! The room goes silent, letting the President blow off steam.
OKUN: Hell no, we know tons about them. The nearest stuff has only happened in the last few days. The President slowly walks around the ship as Okun talks. David, mouth agape, just stares at it.

PRESIDENT: ( exploding ) People are dying out there. I don't think "exciting" is the word I'd choose to describe it! The room goes silent, letting the President blow off steam.
PRESIDENT: ( calming ) What can you tell us about the enemy we're facing?
OKUN: Not all too dissimilar to us. Breathes oxygen, comparable tolerances to heat, cold.probably why they're interested in our planet. Hey, you wanna see them?
OKUN: This is vault, or as some of us have come to call it, the "freak Okun hits a switch and the sealed partition lifts revealing.
OKUN: When we found them they were wearing bio-mechanical suits. Once we got them off, we were able to learn a great deal about their anatomy; eyes, ears, bipolar digestive system. no vocal cords though. We're assuming they communicate with each other through other means. David cannot contain his fascination. He steps forward.
DAVID: What kind of other means? Hand signals, body language?
OKUN: Some kind of extra sensory perception. Telepathy.
PRESIDENT: Can they be killed?
OKUN: These three died in the crash. Their bodies are as frail as our own. You just have to get past their technology, which is, I'm sorry to say, far more advanced. The President turns to David.
PRESIDENT: You unlocked a part of that technology. You cracked their All I did was stumble onto their signal. I don't know how helpful I can be.
DAVID: All I did was stumble onto their signal. I don't know how helpful I can be.
PRESIDENT: Show them what you've discovered. Work together. We've got to find a way to beat them.
GUARD: Sorry, Lt. Colonel, I can't open the gates without clearance.
STEVE: You want to see my clearance? Impatiently Steve grabs the Guard by the collar, pulling him over the side of the truck putting him face to face with the bundled parachute in the flatbed. Steve rips the fabric aside THE ALIEN CREATURE Still unconscious, the alien stirs. The Guard JUMPS BACK, shitting in his pants. Quickly he signals for the other to open the gate. The armada quickly drives past.
BLACKNESS: Total darkness. Suddenly light pours in as a door is open. We see the faces of Okun, David and three technicians all peering at us with inquisitive expressions.
OKUN: See the gizmos flashing?
DAVID: Someone grab my laptop for me? One of the technicians rushes off as Okun leans close.
OKUN: Find something interesting?
DAVID: The technician hands David his retrieved laptop which he quickly flips open and turns on.
DAVID: These patterns here, they're repeating sequentially, just David turns his laptop around for Okun to see. The pattern on David's laptop flashes identically as the alien screen. .their countdown signal. Their using this frequency for computer communications. It's how they co- ordinate their ships.
OKUN: You know, you're really starting to make us look bad. The two men exchange a smile. Another TECHY pops his head They got one! They got one, INT. HALLWAY OFF MAIN HANGAR - AREA 51 - SAME The bundled alien lays on a stretcher that's wheeled quickly into the hall. Okun and his staff surround it. Trailing behind them is Steve, Russell and Miguel.
TECHY: ( out of breath ) They got one! They got one, INT. HALLWAY OFF MAIN HANGAR - AREA 51 - SAME The bundled alien lays on a stretcher that's wheeled quickly into the hall. Okun and his staff surround it. Trailing behind them is Steve, Russell and Miguel.
OKUN: How long has it been unconscious?
RUSSELL: Excuse me Doctor.
STEVE: Three hours.
OKUN: Get him into containment, stat.
RUSSELL: My boy is very sick, he needs immediate attention. Okun ignores Russell, hitting the elevator switch on the wall, the room begins its hydraulic HUM.
OKUN: He's dying out. I want him sprayed down with saline. Russell SLAMS his fist against the switch, the room stops. He GRABS a doctor nearby, gets in his face.
RUSSELL: My boys is slipping into a diabetic coma. If you don't do something about it right now he will die. Miguel is surprised and proud of Russell as he holds DOCTOR ISAACS, meaning business.
DR. ISAACS: O'Haver, Miller, come with me. Take us to him.
GENERAL GREY: You were the head of the National Intelligence Agency! You knew all about this. When were you planning on informing the rest of It had been deemed classified.
NIMZIKI: It had been deemed classified.
GENERAL GREY: Christ, why didn't you say anything about this when they first arrived? You could have warned us before we launched a counter attack that cost us hundreds of American pilots! Just then the President enters along with Constance and some other ADVISORS. He examines a paper map of the United States, tacked to the wall, each major city circled in black.
PRESIDENT: Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia, And there are scattered reports of sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth, And Memphis. The President and his team take seats at the large conference We've learned that NATO and western allied installations were the firs to be taken out. We were next. They knew exactly where and how to hit us. Grey sneaks an accusatory glare at Nimziki.
GENERAL GREY: ( composing himself ) And there are scattered reports of sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth, And Memphis. The President and his team take seats at the large conference We've learned that NATO and western allied installations were the firs to be taken out. We were next. They knew exactly where and how to hit us. Grey sneaks an accusatory glare at Nimziki.
PRESIDENT: And our forces?
GENERAL GREY: We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir. If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.
PRESIDENT: We're being exterminated. The room is quiet. Constance runs her fingers through her hair. The door to the room opens and Lt. Mitchell enters with Mr. President, this is Lt. Colonel Steven Hill. The President quickly gets to his feet, anxiously shaking Steve's hand.
MITCHELL: Mr. President, this is Lt. Colonel Steven Hill. The President quickly gets to his feet, anxiously shaking Steve's hand.
PRESIDENT: Lieutenant, congratulations.
STEVE: Thank you, sir.
PRESIDENT: Where is the prisoner now?
MITCHELL: We have him in isolation. The doctors are very hopeful he will I'd like to see him.
PRESIDENT: I'd like to see him.
MITCHELL: Yes, sir. The General is concerned but the President is determined. They head for the door.
STEVE: ( to General Grey ) General, I'm anxious to get back to El Toro.
GENERAL GREY: Didn't anyone tell you? I'm sorry. El Toro was destroyed in the attack. Steve is shattered, he had no idea.
JASMINE: These should last us a while. As Margaret tries to move, she winces in pain. Jasmine rushes to her aid. The color from her face drained, Margaret looks like she's taking a turn for the worse.
JASMINE: Don't move. Stay still. Jasmine adjusts the bandages as Margaret turns and see Dylan curled up next to Boomer, too adorable. Slowly he starts to wake up.
MARGARET: Your son.
JASMINE: He's my angel.
MARGARET: Was his father stationed here?
JASMINE: He wasn't his father. I was kinda hoping he'd want the job, though. Jasmine becomes sad, remembering. Margaret changes the So, what do yo do for a living?
MARGARET: So, what do yo do for a living?
JASMINE: I'm a dancer.
MARGARET: Really? Ballet?
JASMINE: ( laughs ) No. Exotic.
MARGARET: Oh. Sorry.
JASMINE: Don't be. I'm not. It's good 'Side, he's worth it. The bandages changed, Jasmine sits down next to Margaret.
MARGARET: And when the dancing's over? What about your future?
JASMINE: Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future. Guess it doesn't really matter Dylan comes walking over.
JASMINE: Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady.
MARGARET: ( surprised ) I thought you didn't recognize me.
JASMINE: Didn't want to say anything. I voted for the other guy.
OKUN: Everyone ready? The doctors exchange nervous glances, nod to each other. At the same moment all they pull on the clamps, unraveling the interlocked cords. As the cords unravel, we SEE that this is in fact a bio-mechanical SUIT as we REVEAL.
THE ALIEN: Beneath the cords lay the unconscious face of the alien, his skin translucent, his body fluids, capillaries, muscle tissue, alien's skin.
OKUN: Do we have life support monitors Yes. If we fuck up it'll all be on tape.
OKUN: Can we get some ventilation in here? I can't take this smell.
OKUN: Yeah. It's just that stink gives me a headache.
THE ALIEN: Suddenly SPRINGS up, the restraining straps SNAPPING. Before Med #2 can react, one of the alien's tentacles SMASHES her across the face. She is sent sprawling backwards.
MITCHELL: Open the door. Get him out of Suspicious, General Grey stops him.
GENERAL GREY: ( to Okun ) Can you hear me?
SOLIDER: ( yelling ) What the hell are you doing? Get out of there!
STEVE: I'm just going to borrow it. The Soldier pulls out his pistol, taking aim.
SOLIDER: No you're not, sir.
STEVE: You really want to shoot me? Steve stares the Soldier down. Reluctantly he lowers his gun.
SOLDIER: Shit. I'm gonna catch the hell for Steve smiles and gives him a quick salute then TAKES OFF. Quickly the bird RISES UP and darts off into the night.
PRESIDENT: Why did you people come here?
PRESIDENT: Where do your people come from? Where is your home?
PRESIDENT: And before here?
PRESIDENT: Can we negotiate a truce? is there room for co-existance? Can there be peace between us?
PRESIDENT: What do you want us to do?
NIMZIKI: Mr. President?
GENERAL GREY: ( to Mitchell ) Is that glass bullet proof?
MITCHELL: No sir. The General draws his pistol. Mitchell and the other military officers follow his lead. Simultaneously they all begin to
FIRE!: The glass SHATTERS into a billion pieces. The Alien is cut to ribbons, falling backwards. The President collapses. So does Okun. A STAFFER rushes over to Okun, checks his pulse.
STAFFER: He's dead. General Grey moves to the President who slowly recovers.
GENERAL GREY: Mr. President, are you okay? Woozily the President sits up, a strange look in his eye.
PRESIDENT: He wanted me to understand. He communicated with me. They're like locusts. They travel from planet to planet, their whole civilization. After they've consumed every natural resource they move on. And we're next. The President stands with a new resolve. He stares at the dead alien on the floor.
PRESIDENT: ( cold ) Prepare a nuclear strike.
DAVID: Just my luck, no ice.
CONSTANCE: I take it you've heard.
DAVID: A toast to the end of the world. David toasts her with the bottle, takes a swig.
CONSTANCE: He didn't come to this decision David nods, he doesn't want to argue. He smiles cynically.
DAVID: You still believe in him.
CONSTANCE: He's a good man.
DAVID: Better be. You left me for him.
CONSTANCE: I wanted a career. Didn't you ever want to be part of something David stares daggers at her.
DAVID: Constance realizes he means their marriage. She's hurt him and can see it. She turns and leaves.
TECHNICIAN #1: We've got the AWAC on line. Signals coming in low. The President's group takes their position behind the EXT. BLACK SKIES - NIGHT The eight B-2 Stealth Bombers break formation, each heading off to their different target destinations.
PRESIDENT: Who will we reach first?
COMMANDER: Houston, Texas. Intercept ETA, six minutes and counting down.
PRESIDENT: Oh my God, Houston.
GENERAL GREY: The major cities have been deserted. Civilian casualties should be at a minimum, sir. One map screen, ENLARGES, tracking the bomber on route to EXT. LIQUOR STORE - OUTSIDE HOUSTON - NIGHT Looters take all they can carry through the broken glass store front. A large heavily armored TANK rolls up front.
PILOT: We have laser targeting locked.
TECHNICIAN #1: Target is locked, sir. Do you wish to deploy? Everyone turns to the President who does not answer.
GENERAL GREY: Mr. President, do you wish to Still there is no answer.
NIMZIKI: Mr. President?
PRESIDENT: ( softly ) EXT. B-2 STEALTH BOMBER - WEAPONS BAY - SAME The bay doors open and a large Tactical Nuclear Cruise Missile drops down, flies parallel with the bomber as it adjusts its radar and laser tracking. Suddenly it SHOOTS OFF. The bomber BANKS AWAY.
PILOT: She's away.
PRESIDENT: ( to himself ) May our children forgive us.
NIMZIKI: ( excited ) It's a hit! The others are still waiting. The monitor shows the night vision picture of the growing MUSHROOM CLOUD rising above the EXT. HOUSTON - WIDE - SAME The MUSHROOM CLOUD engulfs the horizon.
NIMZIKI: We got the bastards! General Grey shoots Nimziki a look. The President holds up a hand, silencing the room.
PRESIDENT: Can they see it? Did it destroy the target?
TANK COMMANDER: Negative. Target remains.
PRESIDENT: Call them back.
NIMZIKI: The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give I said call them back. As the technicians call the bombers away, the President sinks into a depression. His last hope of survival gone.
PRESIDENT: I said call them back. As the technicians call the bombers away, the President sinks into a depression. His last hope of survival gone.
TRANSPORT HELICOPTER: The Transport Helicopter touches down and Steve leaps out, racing towards Jasmine. Overwhelmed, Jasmine jumps into his
JASMINE: You're late.
STEVE: You know how I like to make a big They kiss.
PRESIDENT: How is she?
ISAACS: I'm sorry, Mr. President. If only we could have gotten to her The President puts his daughter down as he sees.
ISAACS: She's bleeding internally. There's nothing else we can do. Stunned, the President watches as Patricia hugs her mother.
MARGARET: Hiya Munchkin.
PATRICIA: Mommy, we were worried. We didn't know where you were.
MARGARET: I'm right here, baby. Recovering, the President nods for the doctors to leave the room. As they begin to march out, he makes his way over to his wife and daughter.
PRESIDENT: Honey, why don't you wait outside so Mommy can get some rest. Patricia kisses her mother, says goodbye and leaves. Out of sight, Margaret winces, fading away. The President grabs her hand for support. She squeezes tightly.
MARGARET: ( through tears ) I'm scared, Tom.
PRESIDENT: It's okay. The doctors said you're going to be just fine. Margaret smiles at the man she knows all too well.
MARGARET: The look between them says more than any words.
JASMINE: I'm so sorry.
PRESIDENT: I just wanted to thank you. You're a very brave woman. Across the hall, Patricia sits in a chair, waiting. Whitmore walks over to her and kneels down next to his small child.
PATRICIA: Is Mommy sleeping now?
PRESIDENT: Yes, baby. Mommy's sleeping.
MOISHE: David, David! What the hell are you doing!?
DAVID: I'm making a mess.
MOISHE: This I can see.
DAVID: We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
MOISHE: David, you're drunk. David slips, falls on his ass, hard. Moishe helps him back up on his feet.
MOISHE: I think you better sleep this off. Go back inside before you catch a Slowly David looks up towards Moishe, an idea.
DAVID: Pops, you're a genius!
MOISHE: What'd I say?
DAVID: A cold? Of course. Sobered, David jumps kisses his father and bolts inside.
NIMZIKI: All right, Connie, we're here. What's this all about?
CONSTANCE: I really have no idea. He just said to bring everyone down here. Steve shows Dylan the alien space craft.
DYLAN: Does that thing fly in outer Steve loos up at the craft admiringly.
STEVE: It certainly does. When the President enters a technician rushes over and knocks on the hatch door on the alien attacker. The door swings open and David climbs down. Grabbing a coke can from the "recycle" trash bin, David places the empty can on top of the alien attacker. David turns and faces the gathering.
DAVID: Could anyone please step back away from the craft? They do and David nods to a Technician inside the craft. The Technician disappears inside, closing the door behind him. A loud HUM emits from the craft. David has to yell over it.
DAVID: Lt. Mitchell, would you mind drawing your pistol?
MITCHELL: From where you're standing, do you think you could shoot that can off the alien craft? Mitchell shrugs affirmatively. David gestures for him to try. Taking aim, Mitchell SHOOTS. The bullet RICOCHETS off the attacker's protective shield. Several people in the crowd dock, afraid of being hit by the errant bullet.
DAVID: From where you're standing, do you think you could shoot that can off the alien craft? Mitchell shrugs affirmatively. David gestures for him to try. Taking aim, Mitchell SHOOTS. The bullet RICOCHETS off the attacker's protective shield. Several people in the crowd dock, afraid of being hit by the errant bullet.
DAVID: Sorry 'bout that. You see, it's protected by the craft's shields. We can't penetrate their defenses.
NIMZIKI: We know that already. What's your David walks over to his laptop, now connected directly to the craft by cables and starts typing furiously.
DAVID: My point is if we can't beat their defenses, then we must get around David stops typing and stares at his wrist watch, silently counting down.
DAVID: Lt. Mitchell, would you please try to shoot it again? Reluctantly Mitchell obliges. This time the can is BLOWN OFF THE CRAFT. Everyone in the room is shocked. The Technician re-opens the craft's door and the loud HUM disappears.
GENERAL GREY: How did you do that?
DAVID: I gave it a cold. The President is fascinated, he steps closer. Moishe beams proudly at his smart son. Constance is amazed. More accurately, I gave it a virus. A computer virus. David turns his laptop around for the President to see.
GENERAL GREY: Are you telling us you can send out a signal that will disable all their shields?
DAVID: Just as they used our satellites against us, we can use their own signal against them. David walks over to a diagram he's made showing the relationship between the Mother Ship, the Space Crafts and the smaller alien attackers. If we plant the virus directly into the mother ship, it would then filter down into all the corresponding ships below.
NIMZIKI: And just how do we infect the "Mother Ship" with a virus? David gestures to the alien attacker behind him.
DAVID: We'll have to fly their craft out of our atmosphere and dock with the mother ship. Intrigued Steve turns and looks back at the alien attacker, sizing it up. David points to a satellite photo of the underbelly of the Mother Ship. We can enter here, upload the virus and set off an explosion that could disable it. This would disorient the smaller ship below and buy you some time to take them Constance reacts, realizing David's participation in the plan.
NIMZIKI: This is ridiculous.
GENERAL GREY: How long would their shields be Once they discover the virus it could be a matter of minutes.
DAVID: Once they discover the virus it could be a matter of minutes.
NIMZIKI: You want us to co-ordinate a massive world wide counter strike with a window of only a few With their shields down it might be possible.
GENERAL GREY: With their shields down it might be possible.
NIMZIKI: Please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? We don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate.
STEVE: I've seen them in action. I've watched their maneuvers. With your permission, sir, I'd like the opportunity to try.
NIMZIKI: That thing's a wreck. It crash landed back in the fifties! We don't even know if it's capable of David turns to the Technicians.
DAVID: Remove the clamps! Technicians move to the large holding clamps on either side of the craft. With a loud CLANK, the clamps are pulled away. For a moment the hulking craft TEETERS unevenly, but quickly stabilizes, FLOATING ABOVE THEM.
DAVID: Any other questions? Everyone stares at the floating ship with wonder.
PRESIDENT: Let's do it.
NIMZIKI: I understand that you're upset over the death of your wife but that's no excuse for making another fatal mistake. The President whirls, grabs Nimziki and SLAMS him against the wall. Holding him tight, the President gets in his face.
PRESIDENT: The only mistake I made was appointing a sniveling little weasel like you Chief of Staff. Constance is about to intervene when General Grey stops her. But this is a mistake, I am thankful to say, I do not have to live with. Mr. Nimziki, you're The President releases him and turns to General Grey. Organize every plane you can find and get some Goddamned pilots to fly them.
GENERAL GREY: Yes, Sir. He storms off leaving everyone stunned.
NIMZIKI: He can't do that.
CONSTANCE: ( amazed ) He just did.
REGINALD: .we've been told that there may be additional re-enforcement in hiding near the Golan Straights. Suddenly the flap to the tent opens. All the pilots draw their pistols frightening the ARAB PILOT who stands in the doorway. The Arab Pilot speaks quickly in Arabic.
REGINALD: What the hell's he saying?
THOMSON: ( explaining ) Seems they're getting a signal. One Morse code.
REGINALD: I still get believe this.
THOMSON: The Iraqis don't appear altogether too pleased with this arrangement.
REGINALD: How do you think the Israelis Sure enough a campsite of ISRAELI PILOTS sits very near by.
THOMSON: It's from the Americans. They want to organize a counter It's about bloody time. What do they plan to do?
REGINALD: It's about bloody time. What do they plan to do?
RUSSIAN #1: ( subtitled ) They claims to be able to bring down their shields.
RUSSIAN #2: When do they want to attack?
JAPANESE PILOT: ( subtitled ) The attack begins in thirteen INT. AREA 51 - WAR ROOM - DAY A large world map has been constructed. Several sites are marked with stickers reading: COMBAT READY. Another sticker is put onto Mr. Fuji. Striding in, the President surveys the war room. General Grey rushes over to meet him.
PRESIDENT: How're we doing?
GENERAL GREY: Better than we thought. General Grey leads the President over to the wall map.
GENERAL GREY: We have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world. Most of Europe, the Middle East and Asia are battle ready.
PRESIDENT: And our troops here?
GENERALE GREY: We've been collecting planes from all over but.
PRESIDENT: But what, General?
GENERAL GREY: Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.
PRESIDENT: Then find them.
MIGUEL: How' he doing?
RUSSELL: Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little Russell holds up his bottle of Jack Daniels. Clearly he's been drinking again. Miguel is crestfallen. Pissed he turns and storms out.
RUSSELL: Miguel. Don't be mad. Miguel! Drunkenly, Russell chases after him.
OFFICER: ( through megaphone ) .We're planning to launch a counter offensive. Russell wanders over towards them. .with our depleted manpower we must ask that anyone with any flight experience come forward. Military training is preferable but anyone who can fly a plane could be useful. Russell pushes his way through the crowd.
RUSSELL: ( slurred ) I can fly, I mean, I'm a pilot. The officer just stares at the bottle of Jack Daniels still in his hand.
OFFICER: Sorry, sir. Russell gets into his face, desperate.
RUSSELL: You don't understand. I've gotta be part of this. This is important to me. They ruined my Why don't you go somewhere and sleep it off. The Officers move on, taking a few volunteers with them. Russell watches them go, dejected. Angrily, he throws the bottle of Jack, SMASHING it.
OFFICER: Why don't you go somewhere and sleep it off. The Officers move on, taking a few volunteers with them. Russell watches them go, dejected. Angrily, he throws the bottle of Jack, SMASHING it.
MITCHELL: We've hid the launcher in the ship's manifold. Mitchell takes a small black box from a table near by. This will be attached to the ships main console.
STEVE: It's just like an AMRAAM launch pad on the stealths.
MITCHELL: Exactly. Use it the same way. Only the nuke won't detonate on impact. You'll have another thirty seconds to get as far away as you can.
DAVID: I'll see how they're doing with the radio transmitter.
STEVE: ( checking his watch ) Oh shit, we're late.
DAVID: We'll meet you there. Steve dashes off as David moves toward the attacker. Constance has been eavesdropping. She walks to David.
CONSTANCE: Thirty seconds? Isn't that cutting it a little too close?
DAVID: We'll be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing David leans under the attacker where a TECHNICIAN is attaching another device.
TECHNICIAN: It's the strongest SHF transmitter we could get. It'll tell us when you've uploaded the virus.
DAVID: Then cross your fingers the shields go down. David turns and walks away, Constance following.
CONSTANCE: With you? I don't understand why you can't just show someone how to plant the virus, somebody trained for this kind of mission?
DAVID: If anything goes wrong I'll have to think quickly, adjust the signal, who knows? David stops, picking up a small trash can labelled "recycle."
DAVID: ( smiling ) You know how I'm always trying to save the planet. This is my David rushes off. Constance watches him leave.
CONSTANCE: ( to herself ) Now he gets ambitious.
DYLAN: It's too tight.
JASMINE: I had to borrow it. I guess that's good enough. Jasmine stands, turns to Dylan.
JASMINE: How do I look? She looks great. But Dylan only gives her the "so-so" hand You're a lot of help. The door behind her flies open and Steve marches in.
JASMINE: You're a lot of help. The door behind her flies open and Steve marches in.
JASMINE: You're late.
STEVE: You know me.
JASMINE: I know, you like to make a big Steve moves next to Jasmine, takes her hand.
STEVE: Before we do this, I want you to know I'm sorry.
JASMINE: Sorry for what?
STEVE: ( serious ) I should have done this a long long time ago.
STEVE: You bet. Steve pulls out the famous "dolphin" ring.
CHAPLAIN: Just then the doors open and David and Constance enter taking seats on opposing sides of the aisle.
CHAPLAIN: Then let's get this show on the Steve and Jasmine take their places at the altar. Jasmine is radiant. Dylan rushes up and joins them. As the ceremony begins, David and Constance share a pregnant glance. Slowly they reach across the aisle and hold hands as Steve and Jasmine exchange their vows.
GENERAL GREY: Beggars can't be choosers, sir. Nodding in agreement, the President walks among the rank and file. Slowly they turn their attention to the President.
PRESIDENT: Good morning. In less than one hour planes from here and all around the world will launch the largest aerial battle in the history of mankind. Mankind. The word has new meaning for all of us now. We are reminded not of our petty differences but of our common Constance, David and Moishe join the group, listening. Even David is moved. Perhaps it's fate that today, July the Fourth, we will once again fight for our freedom. Not from tyranny, persecution or oppression. But from annihilation. We're fighting for our right to live, to exit. From this day on, the fourth day of July will no longer be remembered as an American holiday but as the day that all of mankind declared we will not go quietly into the night. We will not vanish without a fight. We will live on. We will survive. The crowd erupts into applause and cheers. The President turns and walks over to an Officer holding a bundle of clothes. General Grey confronts the President as he begins to Mr. President, just what do you think you're doing?
GENERAL GREY: Mr. President, just what do you think you're doing?
PRESIDENT: I'm a pilot, Will. This is where I belong. General Grey wants to argue but can't.
STEVE: When I'm back we'll light those Jasmine hugs them both as Moishe walks over to David.
MOISHE: David, take these. David looks down at the "barf bags" in Moishe's hand.
DAVID: Thanks, Pops.
MOISHE: I want you should know, I'm very proud of you, son. That means more to David than Moishe could have known.
CONSTANCE: Be careful. Constance hugs David as Steve suddenly freaks out.
STEVE: Damn it. We can't go yet. I gotta find some cigars. Steve is about to bolt when Moishe grabs him, retrieving two cigars from his coat pocket.
MOISHE: My last two. With my blessings.
STEVE: You're a lifesaver. Steve grabs them and climbs inside. David smiles awkwardly, then follows Steve.
STEVE: Hang on to this. For our victory dance. But not 'til we hear the fat lady sing. Reluctantly David takes it. As he does Steve notices the "barf bag" on David's lap. Off Steve's look.
DAVID: I have a confession to make. I'm not real big on flying.
STEVE: INT. STORAGE LAB - SAME Constance and Jasmine join the others behind the observation glass outside the room as the Attacker prepares for lift off. Part of the ceiling suddenly PEELS AWAY, revealing an enormous SHAFT leading topside.
STEVE: You ready? Let' rock and roll. Steve pulls back on the throttle but the attacker swings
STEVE: Like a stick shift diagram of a car, a small hand written "post it" card is pasted onto the dash. Steve reaches over and turns it upside down, righting the problem.
STEVE: Let's try that again. This time he pushes the throttle forward and the Attacker JERKS ahead.
DAVID: What the hell are you doing?
STEVE: Just getting a feel for her.
PRESIDENT: Grey, you read me?
GENERAL GREY: ( filtered ) Roger, Eagle One, our primary target has shifted course.
PRESIDENT: ( filtered ) Where's it headed?
GENERAL GREY: I think our secret is out. They're headed right for us.
GENERAL GREY: ( filtered ) ETA thirty six minutes. The President gets a determined look in his eye. He FIRES UP his engine. Following his lead, engines ignite, canopies lock down and planes taxi to position.
STEVE: You still with me? David nods sheepishly. Steve's eyes go wide with wonder as the ship climbs to the edge of our atmosphere.
STEVE: ( to himself ) I've waited a long time for this. The ship begins to SHAKE, rattling harshly as it climbs. Through the window we SEE the blue sky EVAPORATE. Slowly a field of STARS take its place. This is the moment Steve had wished for all his life. He's not disappointed. David, however, is not so thrilled.
DAVID: That's it. Head straight for it. But Steve gets distracted, something wrong with the controls.
STEVE: Something's happening. It's not David looks over at his laptop, connected to the ship's on board computers. Th signal is ADJUSTING.
DAVID: ( thrilled ) I was counting on that. They're bringing us in.
PRESIDENT: We have visual.
GENERAL GREY: ( filtered ) Do not engage until we've confirmed the package has been INT. WAR ROOM - SAME Constance is standing by Lt. Mitchell behind the Military cadre coordinating the battle.
PRESIDENT: INT. WAR ROOM - SAME Constance is standing by Lt. Mitchell behind the Military cadre coordinating the battle.
CONSTANCE: What if that thing gets here before we can plant the virus?
MITCHELL: The entire compound is buried deep within the mountain. It should give us some protection.
CONSTANCE: But what about all the people Mitchell shoots her a worried look. Quickly they both dash EXT. MOTHER SHIP - SAME Steve and David's attacker flies towards the gigantic Mother Ship. Hundreds of other attackers flow in and out of the Mother Ship through the many triangular portals. Steve and David's attacker's drawn into one of them.
DAVID: Must be thousands of them. What are they doing?
STEVE: Looks like they're preparing the INT. DOCKING STATIONS - MOTHER SHIP - CONTINUOUS They pass the parade ground and head into the middle of this huge cavernous sphere, closing in on the many LANDINGS. Hundreds of attackers are docked at each one. In the center of the Landing are large BAY WINDOWS, inside is a kind of control tower. We can SEE several ALIEN WORKERS through the glass. Steve and David's attacker is heading straight towards them.
STEVE: This won't work. They'll see before we can do anything. Lifting up another hand written card labeled "window," David pushes the button underneath.
DAVID: These things are fully equipped. Reclining bucket seats, power A BLAST SHIELD lowers covering the window. Slowly Steve and David's attacker lowers onto large docking CLAMPS which LOCK ON, holding it in place.
DAVID: We're in! David starts typing frantically.
MITCHELL: He's uploading the virus.
GENERAL GREY: ( into mic ) Eagle One.
GENERAL GREY: ( filtered ) .the package is being delivered. Stand by to engage.
PRESIDENT: EXT. AREA 51 - BRENNON TRAILER - SAME Alicia struggles to drag out a large duffle bag. Philip ( the boy who brought the penicillin earlier ) rushes over.
PHILIP: Let me get that. He grabs the bag for her. Alicia smiles. Miguel helps Troy down from the trailer. As they rush away, Miguel turns to Where's Russell?
MIGUEL: Where's Russell?
CONSTANCE: Hurry, we've got to get everyone Constance looks up and SEES off in the distance.
DAVID: The virus is in. All we can do now is pray.
GENERAL GREY: ( filtered ) Delivery complete. Engage.
PRESIDENT: The fighter jets GUN IT and overtake the smaller planes in front of them. Below the President's plane the weapons bay door opens and a long range AMRAAM Missile DROPS DOWN, computes its target and
GENERAL GREY: Keep your fingers crossed.
PRESIDENT: Come on, baby.
GENERAL GREY: It didn't work. Disengage. Sir, get your people out of there.
PRESIDENT: Not yet! Below his plane another MISSILE drops down, and DARTS OFF.
GENERAL GREY: You did it! A direct hit!
PRESIDENT: We're going in! Squadron leaders, take point. The fighters break off into six group of five. One by one, each fighter DROPS A MISSILE. We follow DOZENS OF MISSILES on their way to the space craft.
MIGUEL: Miguel gets swept up in the tide. As the last of them enter the hangar, TWO ALIEN ATTACKERS arrive behind them, STRAFING the ground. The rows of trailers homes EXPLODE one after ANGLE - ELEVATOR HALLWAY - BACK OF HANGAR Constance ushers the crowd into the elevator hallway. Packed into the hallway together, they are panicked at the sound of the nearby explosions. As the last one is safely inside, Constance turns back and SEES.
DAVID: Get us out of here!
STEVE: I can't shake her free.
STEVE: What're you doing?
DAVID: It's not me. They're overriding the system. The blast shield continues to peel away. David and Steve drop down below the dash, hiding from view. As the view becomes unobstructed we SEE.
STEVE: David leans from his hiding position and SEES several other alien attackers are moving in on them. They are surrounded.
DAVID: Check and mate.
NIMZIKI: I'm not Jewish.
MOISHE: It's okay.
ALICIA: This could be our last night on Earth. I don't want to die a If we do, we'll both die virgins. But at last we'll be together. Alicia smiles, a nice guy at last.
PHILIP: If we do, we'll both die virgins. But at last we'll be together. Alicia smiles, a nice guy at last.
OFFICER: We're running out of missiles, Sir. We're just not causing enough damage.
GENERAL GREY: ( filtered ) They're getting ready to fire the big gun. You're going to have to find a vulnerable spot, fast.
PRESIDENT: I've got an idea. Keep 'em off my Taking the advice, the President DIVES. He's met by two flanking Fighters ( EAGLES 9 & 2 ) as they cruise the underbelly of the City Destroyer. Sure enough, the SCHISM is opening, preparing to fire the WALL OF DESTRUCTION.
PRESIDENT: Let's take 'em out before they take us out. The President locks the SCHISM hatchway into the center of his HUD ( heads up display ). Just as he FIRES, Eagle 9 is BLOWN OUT OF THE SKY. It rocks the President, sending his missile off target. Off balance, the missile hits just wide of the hatchway and EXPLODES, rocking the entire ship.
PRESIDENT: I'm out of missiles! Eagle 2?
GENERAL GREY: We're out of time. Get out of there! Get as far away as you EXT. PRESIDENT'S FIGHTER - SAME Pissed, the President refuses to give up.
PRESIDENT: Doesn't anyone have any damned missiles left?!
PRESIDENT: ( filtered ) Who is that? What are you doing?
RUSSELL: ( into mic ) It's okay, Sir. I'm packin'. We SEE he has a large MISSILES propped up in the seat behind him. A light on it flashes ARMED.
RUSSELL: ( filtered ) Just keep those guys off me for a few more seconds. Hearing his voice, Miguel is shocked. He moves closer towards the monitors.
RUSSELL: ( filtered ) Do me one favor.
OFFICER: Who is that guy?
MIGUEL: Miguel races over to the microphone, attempts to grab it.
RUSSELL: ( filtered ) .tell my children I love them very much.
MIGUEL: ( filtered ) Dad! No! Russell smiles at b being called "Dad."
RUSSELL: I've got to, kid. You were always better at taking care of them than I was anyways. Russell turns off his radio as he banks UPWARD towards the open SCHISM. The climb is steep, and the bi-wing nearly stalls out. Suddenly the bright lights VANISH and the beam begins to form. Russell's bi-wing just makes it INSIDE THE OPEN SCHISM and disappears from view. The President and remaining fighters BANK AWAY, clearing. Suddenly, A GIGANTIC EXPLOSION, RIPS THROUGH THE CENTER OF THE SPACE CRAFT. It's causing a CHAIN REACTION of explosion. Teetering, the entire space ship, turns away out of control.
GENERAL GREY: Let's get on the wire. Tell every squadron around the world how to shoot those fuckers down.
STEVE: I guess there's nothing left to do. Let's nuke 'em. David realizes they're both about to die. He stares at the Funny, I always thought things like these would kill me. They share a quick sober laugh.
DAVID: ( re: cigar ) Funny, I always thought things like these would kill me. They share a quick sober laugh.
STEVE: Nice meeting you.
DAVID: You as well. Steve lights his cigar, then lights David's.
STEVE: EXT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ALIEN ATTACKER - SAME Popping up from behind the dash, cigars in their mouths, Steve and David start waving "good-bye" like idiots. The Aliens in the tower don't know how to react. The attackers move in for the kill.
STEVE: Think they know what's coming? He reaches down to the black box we saw before and enters the launch code.
DAVID: ( still waving ) Not a chance in hell.
STEVE: We're loose!
DAVID: Doesn't matter. Game's over.
STEVE: I don't hear no fat lady. Steve THROTTLES IT. The craft JOLTS AWAY.
JASMINE: ( to General Grey ) Any word from Steve? Behind her, Constance rushes over, the same thing on her mind. Before he can answer they HEAR a ROAR above. They all become silent as they turn and look to the skies.
JASMINE: You scared the hell out of me.
STEVE: Yeah, but what an entrance!
JASMINE: Constance comes running up to David, hugs him tightly.
STEVE: Constance comes running up to David, hugs him tightly.
CONSTANCE: Are you all right?
DAVID: Did it work?
CONSTANCE: You bet it did. She hugs him. They kiss.
PRESIDENT: We're getting reports from all over. Their ships are going down! As they begin to celebrate, they look up to the sky.
STEVE: Didn't I promise you fireworks? Everyone stares in wonder at the beautiful lights.
