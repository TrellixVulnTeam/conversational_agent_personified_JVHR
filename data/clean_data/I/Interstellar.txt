INTERSTELLAR: Written by Jonathan Nolan
STORY BY: Jonathan Nolan, Kip Thorne & Lynda Obst
ASSISTANT: I'm on hold with the INS.
ANSEN: We have double checked it. Someone finally picks up the line.
ASSISTANT: Yes. I'm trying to reach- ( pause, listens ) No, I don't think you understand how serious this is.
ANSEN: What did they say?
ASSISTANT: They said we should look out the Ansen steps to the window and looks out: In the courtyard below, coeds are scrambling to get out of the way as a military helicopter sets down in the middle of the quad and dozens of ARMED FEDERAL AGENTS converge on his INT. MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM, LIGO, CALTECH DAY Ansen sits, alone, on one side of a conference table. The other side is filled with GOVERNMENT MEN NSA mostly, some DIA. The door opens and his assistant steps in. Armed guards pat him down, then shove him into a seat.
ANSEN: Is that really necessary? One of the NSA agents leans forward.
NSA AGENT: You've been complaining for years that the government doesn't take your project seriously enough, Doctor.
ANSEN: Yesterday morning, our facility in Hanford identified this signal: a neutron star colliding with a supermassive black hole. We went through the last year's data and triangulated the source. The pulse is translated into a crude animatic of a neutron star circling into the black hole.
NSA AGENT: We know that, Doctor. What we don't know is why, according to your numbers, this event took place right here in our own solar system. Suddenly, the image overlays the sun, the earth, and the rest of our solar system around the black hole.
ANSEN: It didn't. Because if it had we'd all be dead by now. On-screen, Jupiter, then the Earth and the inner planets are consumed by the black hole. Only the sun survives, pulled into orbit around its new master.
NSA AGENT: I've read your book, Doctor. You said that wormholes are impossible.
ANSEN: There is nothing quite as satisfying as being proved utterly wrong.
NSA AGENT: Stabilized by what? Ansen pauses, unsure. His assistant steps in to his defense.
ASSISTANT: We don't have any way to answer that You're not under peer review here, Doctor. I don't care about your reputation. I need to know how that thing got there. Now. Ansen finally speaks up.
NSA AGENT: ( IGNORES HIM )
ANSEN: If you're worried about an invasion, I would start drafting the articles of surrender.
NSA AGENT: Then why is it there?
ANSEN: I don't know. Maybe it's an invitation. A chance to commune with an advanced species. The assistant, embarrassed, looks down. The agent notices.
NSA AGENT: You don't agree?
ASSISTANT: ( DELICATE )
ANSEN: We need to get back to work. I have a conference call with our European partners in fifteen minutes.
NSA AGENT: We severed the connections to your European partners this morning.
ANSEN: ( INDIGNANT )
GOVERNMENT MAN: We'll send them a check.
ASSISTANT: They can't keep this a secret. You know that. Sooner or later. The younger man looks down, embarrassed, as he notices that tears are rolling down the older man's cheeks.
ANSEN: I don't care about that. I've spent my whole life being afraid we would wipe ourselves out before this moment arrived. We've made so many mistakes, I wasn't sure we'd make it. The assitant realizes that the old man is weeping for joy. But this will change everything. Fifty years from now, nothing will be the same. The older man looks at the simulation on the screen of the tiny link between our galaxy and another.
BALLPLAYER: Seized up on us.
COOPER: Long way to come by bus. I thought you guys would have a plane.
BALLPLAYER: We did. Ran out of parts for it. You know anything about diesels?
COOPER: A little. Cooper steps to the engine compartment. The ballplayer notices Cooper's two boys, TOM, 15, and MURPH, 10, watching them. He wanders over.
BALLPLAYER: You think your dad's going to be able to help us out? Murph, a filth-encrusted kid with a black eye, smiles at the My dad can fix anything.
MURPH: My dad can fix anything.
BALLPLAYER: Sure appreciate the help.
COOPER: ( SHRUGS )
DONALD: Popcorn at a ball game is unnatural. I want a hot dog.
MURPH: ( CONFUSED )
TOM: Is that a comet, Dad?
COOPER: ( shakes his head ) Satellite. Big one. Probably Everyone watches the fireworks as the satellite burns up in the upper atmosphere. After a moment, play resumes it's a pretty show, but everyone has seen it plenty of times before. Down on the field, the Dodgers' catcher misses an easy pop fly and the Yankees load the bases. Donald looks disgusted.
DONALD: Those clowns would get their asses handed to them by the ballplayers I grew up watching.
COOPER: You ruin it for the boys when you talk like that.
DONALD: I'm not doing my grandkids any favors by lying to them. They're growing up watching lousy baseball.
COOPER: They didn't have any baseball at all when I was a kid. That shuts the old man up for now. They drive on in silence.
DONALD: Nelson's burning up his crops. Found some of the blight on the okra. Cooper watches the men walking through the fields, setting fire to the crop.
COOPER: I thought okra wasn't susceptible.
DONALD: ( SHRUGS )
COOPER: Something wrong with your truck?
DONALD: ( SMILES )
COOPER: What does that have to do with We're supposed to be repopulating the earth. Gotta pull your weight. Besides, the boys could do with a woman in their lives. The boys run out of the house and pile into the truck. Cooper pulls away before Donald can continue.
DONALD: We're supposed to be repopulating the earth. Gotta pull your weight. Besides, the boys could do with a woman in their lives. The boys run out of the house and pile into the truck. Cooper pulls away before Donald can continue.
COOPER: Get the spare, Tom.
TOM: That is the spare.
COOPER: All right. We'll use the patch kit. He moves to the back of the truck. Murph suddenly looks very glum.
MURPH: I. I think the patch kit might not be there. ( off his look ) Because I was using it for my bike. Cooper looks down at the dirt. Sighs.
COOPER: Murph's law.
MURPH: ( CONFUSED )
TOM: The kid doesn't even know what he was named after. Cooper shoots Tom a look enough.
COOPER: Find something to patch it with.
TOM: How am I supposed to do that?
COOPER: Figure it out. I'm not always going to be here to help you. Cooper leaves Tom to catch up with his younger son, who is looking out over the river.
MURPH: Is that really why I'm named Murph, Listen to me. Murph's law doesn't mean that. It means what can happen will happen. All kinds of things. Good or bad. And that's the way you want it to be.
COOPER: Listen to me. Murph's law doesn't mean that. It means what can happen will happen. All kinds of things. Good or bad. And that's the way you want it to be.
MURPH: Because if nothing ever happened to you then you wouldn't learn anything. Murph is staring off into the distance. He's heard something.
COOPER: Because if nothing ever happened to you then you wouldn't learn anything. Murph is staring off into the distance. He's heard something.
TOM: What about the tire?
TOM: OVER THERE-
COOPER: It's a Chinese military drone. Solar cells could power an entire farm.
TOM: ( UNSURE )
COOPER: Almost got it. Don't slow down. In front of them, Tom and his brother watch as the drone plummets from view.
TOM: Cooper looks up. Ahead, the trail disappears as the edge of the hills falls away it's a three hundred-foot drop. Tom locks up the brakes.
TOM: We lost it.
COOPER: ( SMILING )
TOM: How long do you think it's been up there, Dad?
COOPER: Chinese mission control went down same as us, twenty years ago. It's been up there ever since.
TOM: What was it doing flying so low? Cooper reads the information pouring into his laptop.
COOPER: It was looking for something. Intercepted some kind of signal.
MURPH: What are you going to do with it?
COOPER: Reprogram it. Give it something socially responsible to do like drive a combine or a tractor.
MURPH: ( QUIET )
COOPER: We need all the help we can get, Murph. This thing has to adapt, just like the rest of us. Cooper gently pries the control module out.
PRINCIPAL: Good to see you, Mr. Cooper. This is Ms. Kelly, Murph's teacher. Cooper smiles at Ms. KELLY, 30s, attractive.
COOPER: What about college?
PRINCIPAL: The University of California only accepts a few hundred students a year, Mr. Cooper. You have to be You're ruling out college for him now? He's only fifteen.
COOPER: You're ruling out college for him now? He's only fifteen.
PRINCIPAL: I'm sorry. I'm afraid Tom's score simply isn't high enough.
COOPER: What are you, about a 36-inch waist?
PRINCIPAL: I'm not sure I see
COOPER: You're telling me you need two numbers to measure your own ass, but just one to measure my son's future? Ms. Kelly stifles a laugh, then, with a look from the principal, takes on the appropriate look of offense.
PRINCIPAL: I understand you're a well-educated man, Mr. Cooper. A scientist?
COOPER: Frankly, the world doesn't need any more engineers. We didn't run out of trains or television sets or We ran out of food.
PRINCIPAL: Frankly, the world doesn't need any more engineers. We didn't run out of trains or television sets or We ran out of food.
COOPER: Are we done?
PRINCIPAL: One more thing. Ms. Kelly here says that Murph brought a book to school about the lunar landings. He slides an old textbook with a picture of a rocket on the cover across the desk to Cooper.
COOPER: One of my old textbooks. Murph liked the pictures.
MS. KELLY: This is one of the old federal textbooks. We've replaced them with corrected versions.
COOPER: MS. KELLY The new textbooks explain that the Apollo lunar missions were faked in order to bankrupt the Soviet Union.
MS. KELLY: The new textbooks explain that the Apollo lunar missions were faked in order to bankrupt the Soviet Union.
COOPER: You don't believe we went to the MS. KELLY I believe it was a brilliant piece of propaganda. The Soviets spent years trying to build rockets and other useless machines.
MS. KELLY: I believe it was a brilliant piece of propaganda. The Soviets spent years trying to build rockets and other useless machines.
COOPER: "Useless machines"?
MS. KELLY: Yes, Mr. Cooper. The kind of wastefulness and excess that the 20th century represented. Your children would be better off learning about this planet, rather than reading fantasies about leaving it. Cooper is silent for a long moment.
COOPER: One of those useless machines they used to make was called an MRI. If we had any of them left the doctors might have been able to find the cyst in my wife's brain before she died, rather than afterwards. And then my kids could have been raised by two parents, instead of me and their pain-in-the-ass grandfather. Ms. Kelly's face falls, ashen. Cooper swallows his anger. Most of it, anyway.
COOPER: Just tell him to power down the controllers for a couple minutes.
COOPER: Bravo-two-eight, requesting permission to enter your airspace.
RIGGS: Thanks for coming down. Half of 'em took off last night, looking for ( points to dunes ) Looks like they found it, too. I thought you were the man to see it. Riggs starts walking up the dune. Cooper follows. Below, on the beach, a dozen more combines and other farming vehicles are lined up at the tideline, warm gulf water lapping at their metal flanks. They are circling a deep crater.
RIGGS: ( FROM ABOVE )
COOPER: Not exactly.
COOPER: Space probe. Never seen one like it, though. Looks like it's been to hell and back. The probe CHIRPS as Cooper belts it into the back.
RIGGS: How do you think it wound up here?
COOPER: Lost, I guess. Guidance satellites would have been shot down by the Chinese twenty years ago. Cooper looks at the probe for a second, admiring its form.
COOPER: Well I don't know what the hell it's made of, but I can't crack it open.
DONALD: Good. Clear it off the table so I can serve dinner. Tom and Murph walk in. Murph's got another black eye.
MURPH: I got suspended. Paul said anyone who believed we went to the moon was an idiot. So I hit him.
COOPER: Good boy. Hand me the scanner. Murph hands his dad a defibrillator he's modified for the purpose. He attaches the shock pads to the sides of the probe and turns on the power. Numbers flash across the screen. Cooper hits a button on the controls and it PULSES.
MURPH: Where is that, dad?
COOPER: I don't know. Cooper looks at the probe.
MURPH: But what about its mission? What about the information onboard?
COOPER: There's no one for it to report to. NASA is all gone. I'm sorry, son. It got home too late. Donald pulls his chowder off the boil and slides the pot unceremoniously onto the table.
DONALD: I heard your meeting at the school didn't go so well. Cooper shakes his head in disgust.
COOPER: Maybe it's better for everyone to forget what they did back then. Reminds us how far we've fallen.
DONALD: ( looks down, ) When I was kid, it felt like they made something new every day. Some gadget or idea.
COOPER: It doesn't bother me that he can't go. It bothers me that he doesn't Tom isn't the problem. He fits in this world just fine. You're the one who doesn't fit, Coop. You don't belong here. You were born forty years too late, or forty years too early I don't know. My daughter knew it, god bless her. And your kids know it, too. Donald drains his beer. Walks to the screen door. Stops, one hand on the frame.
DONALD: Tom isn't the problem. He fits in this world just fine. You're the one who doesn't fit, Coop. You don't belong here. You were born forty years too late, or forty years too early I don't know. My daughter knew it, god bless her. And your kids know it, too. Donald drains his beer. Walks to the screen door. Stops, one hand on the frame.
MURPH: Try a different direction. As they roll the probe in a circle, its SHRIEK stops, then picks up again. Cooper zeroes in on the direction that keeps it quiet southwest and pushes it along in the dirt.
COOPER: It's a fail-safe. It's going to annoy us into taking it home. Cooper stops rolling the probe and, after a moment, it begins SHRIEKING again.
TOM: What are we going to do? Cooper gets a rope.
COOPER: We're going to get some sleep. He begins tying the rope around the probe.
MURPH: What are we doing today?
COOPER: You're staying here and cleaning the Murph looks crestfallen. He looks out towards the yard. Cooper follows his stare.
MURPH: But what if there is, dad? What if there's something we can salvage? Cooper thinks it over. Murph scrambles to get his shoes.
COOPER: Got any diesel?
OLD MAN: Plenty. Shame you can't eat it. Cooper stretches the hose over to the plane.
MURPH: I think it's home. Cooper circles the island until he finds a long, flat grassland in the center of the island.
MURPH: Dad, what are these things?
COOPER: I don't know. Don't touch them.
COOPER: Careful. There's some kind of underground facility here. We Cooper notices his son is frozen, staring at something: Standing bolt upright in the middle of the clearing, wearing an old straw hat, is an eight-foot-tall military spec ROBOT.
MURPH: Is it still. alive?
COOPER: Can't be. It's a marine. Haven't made them for thirty years. I've never seen one intact before. Cooper steps closer to the robot, which is frozen. Its alloy frame heavily tarnished and weather-beaten. It looks like it might have been standing here for decades.
MURPH: But can't we take it back? You could fix it up, get him to do chores.
COOPER: No. I don't know what this place is, but we're leaving. Murph, ignoring his father, steps forward to touch the robot. Suddenly, the robot SPRINGS into action, picking up the boy and hoisting him up to eye level. Cooper, stunned, points the rifle at the robot. The robot turns, dropping the boy, RIPS the rifle from Cooper's hands, BENDS it, then SLAMS him up against the side of the water tank. Cooper punches him, then winces in agony. Murph picks up the rifle and begins HITTING the robot as hard as he can. The robot opens his mouth and addresses Cooper calmly in the clipped tones of a US marine.
ROBOT: Tell the boy to stop hitting me.
COOPER: ( IGNORING HIM )
COOPER: We were just looking for salvage.
BRAND: Is that what they call stealing these I didn't know it belonged to anyone.
COOPER: I didn't know it belonged to anyone.
BRAND: It doesn't.
COOPER: You've got me wrong, lady.
BRAND: Really? You're not the kind of guy who turns a combat marine with a supercomputer for a brain into a riding lawn mower? Cooper says nothing she's not that far off the mark.
TARS: Don't forget your gun.
COOPER: ( points at Tars ) Word of advice careful with that thing. When the war was over, they didn't know when to stop fighting.
BRAND: I'd trust him a lot more than I'd trust you. Keep moving. Cooper backs up to his plane. Tars follows him. Suddenly, in the plane, the probe emits a high-pitch SQUEAL. Tars responds instantly, striding past Cooper to the plane. He sees the probe. Tries to open the door. It's locked.
COOPER: Wait a second Tars TEARS the door off the plane. Reaches inside and pulls out the probe. The woman looks at it, stunned.
BRAND: Get it inside.
COOPER: Now who's stealing from who?
BRAND: This doesn't belong to you.
COOPER: You're right. It belongs to NASA, which shut down thirty years ago when the federal government ran out of money. Brand says nothing. The elevator slows to a stop at the bottom of the tunnel. Heavy BLAST DOORS grind open and Brand motions for Cooper to step forward.
COOPER: Who are you people?
BRAND: ( WRY ) BRAND ( CONT'D )
OLD ENGINEER: Where did you find it?
COOPER: BRAND'S FATHER
BRAND'S FATHER: ( thinking it over ) Of course. It must have been looking for Canaveral. Tars bolts the probe down into a purpose built rig. DOYLE, 40s, an engineer, begins hooking leads into the probe.
COOPER: Canaveral's been gone for thirty Brand ignores him. Doyle looks up from his monitor, frustrated.
DOYLE: It's not responding to the handshake. I can't open anything on primary. Brand looks up at Cooper.
BRAND: What did you do to it?
COOPER: Nothing. I got something off of it. Cooper looks around. There's a safety station on the wall with a battery powered defibrillator.
OLD ENGINEER: Of course. The high voltage allows you to image the entire memory unit at once. Information begins appearing on the terminal's screen.
COOPER: Most of the disk was noise. Couple of clean sectors, though. Suddenly, the monitor starts pulling good data off of the probe. The older man and Doyle begin sorting through it. Cooper smiles at Brand, who seems less than impressed. The footage of the ice-covered planet Cooper saw earlier pops onto the screen. The engineers and physicists get very quiet, studying the It found something.
DOYLE: It found something.
COOPER: There aren't any planets like that anywhere near earth. Not even if this thing was gone for thirty years. Brand looks at Cooper, appraising. She turns to the older He's heard enough. If we're going to launch, we need to keep them here until afterwards.
BRAND: He's heard enough. If we're going to launch, we need to keep them here until afterwards.
COOPER: You can't keep us here.
BRAND: He could endanger the mission.
COOPER: I'm not going to endanger it any more than you already have. Cooper points to a telemetry unit that is being repaired by a robot on a nearby bench.
DOYLE: Why not? We've tested it a hundred The power supply is no good. If the voltage fluctuates under load, the unit will fail.
COOPER: The power supply is no good. If the voltage fluctuates under load, the unit will fail.
BRAND: Now how could you possibly know that?
COOPER: Bought thirty of them off a guy in Florida. Had to rebuild every last They work great on a riding lawn mower. Brand looks back at the telemetry system. The older engineer watches the exchange, thinking.
COOPER: You plan on keeping us here forever?
TARS: ( SHRUGS )
MURPH: What are they doing, dad?
COOPER: I guess no one told them they were out of a job. ( nods at Tars ) Same as the rest of these people. Cooper notices through the glass door of the lab that Brand and the older engineer are arguing about something. She finally relents and walks towards the door. Brand walks in. She gestures for Cooper to follow.
BRAND: The mission commander wants to see you. Your son can stay here. He'll be all right with Tars. Cooper eyes Tars warily. Then steps outside.
COOPER: I thought the old man was in charge.
BRAND: ( ANNOYED )
COOPER: Not you?
BRAND: I'm a biologist.
COOPER: ( LAUGHS )
CASE: You're the man who brought us the ( off his look ) Thank you. We tested the telemetry board you warned us about. It failed under high voltage, just as you said. Come with me, please. Case strides off.
CASE: You're right, Mr. Cooper. The planet you saw is a long way from earth. A very long way indeed. Brand looks down. Case notices.
FATHER ): Go ahead, John. Brand's father taps a few keys and the schematic he built fifty years beforehand flickers onto the screen.
BRAND'S FATHER: It's a wormhole. A shortcut leading to a galaxy on the far side of the universe. We found it fifty years Cooper looks at the animatic, taking it in.
CASE: Based on the information on the probe, we're finally preparing to send the manned mission.
COOPER: That rocket doesn't have enough thrust or fuel to get you to Jupiter.
CASE: The main ship was built in orbit. It has nuclear engines, with enough fuel to last for several years. Cooper looks at the schematic.
COOPER: Why are you telling me this? I already told you I'm not going to tell anyone about this place.
CASE: I know you won't, Mr. Cooper. We're telling you this because I want you to join us. Cooper looks at him. Is he serious?
COOPER: But I don't have any of the experience. Any training. You people have been preparing for this for Case shakes his head.
CASE: Humans worry about things like rank and experience. I'm only concerned with whether someone would be useful.
COOPER: No. I'm sorry. Cooper is deeply conflicted. But he can't leave his boys I can't help you. I have responsibilities. Things that, no offense, are more important than a scientific mission. Case shakes his head.
CASE: I'm not a scientist, Mr. Cooper. And this is not a scientific mission. It's a rescue mission. He rises and shakes Cooper's hand.
COOPER: Rescue? Rescue who?
COOPER: The blight.
BRAND: In the last century strands were limited to one or two species. But this one targets everything. Essentially it's more efficient at consuming our food than we are. Cooper looks at the dying corn.
COOPER: But it doesn't affect the corn.
BRAND: Not yet. But it will. We've grown a dozen forms of it that can. It's just a matter of time before the same ones develop out there.
COOPER: ( REALIZING )
BRAND: ( shakes her head ) Who's going to find it? The universities are a joke. People like you are reduced to scavenging just to get by.
COOPER: You've known this for how long? And you didn't try to tell anyone?
BRAND: What would be the point? So humanity could spend the last fifty years of its life fighting over the scraps? It's better that they don't know. Cooper begins to argue, then stops. He knows enough history to know she's right. He looks at the withering crops.
COOPER: ( QUIET )
BRAND: A new home for humanity. We'll set up a colony, then return to bring more people across.
COOPER: But you'd still only be able to save a few hundred. Maybe a thousand.
BRAND: Would it be better if we all died? She looks him directly in the eye.
DONALD: You get older, sometimes you just want to sit back and watch it all play out. Your life. Your kids' lives. The whole crazy story.
COOPER: I can't go. I have to look after the boys.
DONALD: You've been preparing these boys to be on their own since their mom died. Besides, I'll be here to look after them, same as I've always been.
COOPER: I have a responsibility to them
DONALD: That's right. You do.
MURPH: I've been doing the math, dad. I weigh about 85 pounds. Now that's an extra ton of fuel. But if-
COOPER: You have to stay here, pal.
MURPH: ( DISTRAUGHT )
COOPER: There's going to be important work to do here, too. Tears are streaming down the boy's face. Cooper takes his watch off. Looks at it.
MURPH: You're not coming back, are you?
COOPER: I will come back. I promise.
COOPER: Don't look so happy to see me.
TARS: ( SHRUGS )
DOYLE: Tars was a Marine. They gave him a sense of humor to help him fit in with his unit better.
COOPER: Great idea. A massive, sarcastic I have a cue light I can turn on when I'm joking, if you like. Tars points to a tiny LED over his eyebrow.
TARS: I have a cue light I can turn on when I'm joking, if you like. Tars points to a tiny LED over his eyebrow.
COOPER: That sounds like a good idea.
TARS: Great. Maybe you can use it to find your way back to the ship after I blow you out the airlock. Cooper looks at him. Tars looks back, deadpan. After a beat, the little light turns on above his right eyebrow. The doors to the bunker begin to grind closed.
BRAND: You don't like this one, you get to help me find a replacement. She heads for the door.
COOPER: I was wondering where you've been getting your supplies.
BRAND: We knew we'd need decades of parts and materials. The government was getting rid of some things. So we arranged to take some off their hands. She cuts the engine and hooks the boat up to a buoy. She tosses a compact rebreather.
COOPER: So you're a salvage diver now? I thought you were a biologist.
BRAND: ( UNIMPRESSED )
BRAND: You can set that down over there. Cooper sets the board down. His eye is drawn to a bizarre experiment an ant colony built into a massive spinning centrifuge. Brand notices.
COOPER: We're taking ants with us?
BRAND: Humans are also collective organisms.
COOPER: I thought humans were more solitary.
BRAND: ( WRY )
COOPER: Looks like hard work.
BRAND: It's a paradox. Life couldn't form without gravity. No stars. No planets. The component pieces would just drift apart. But too much of it and you're trapped. Brand's guard relaxes a tiny bit as she talks about her work. The moment passes quickly, and she continues on into the stack of equipment.
CASE: We've updated our mission parameters based on the data from the probe. Case switches the map to a vista filled with stars and black Based on our latest modelling we think the region on the far side of the wormhole is the center of a Case zooms in on the center of the hologram: an incredibly bright mass with plasma jets firing off in either direction.
COOPER: Is that a star? ROTH, 50s, the crew's brilliant and blunt physicist, zooms the map in, revealing, at the center, a black heart.
ROTH: No. A black hole. There are several in the region, but this is the largest a billion times heavier than the sun. I call it Gargantua.
DOYLE: ( LAUGHS )
ROTH: ( SHRUGS )
DOYLE: ( LOW )
CASE: We're headed for this smaller black hole. Roth calls it Pantagruel. We think the ice planet is here- Case draws a finger through the air, leaving a red trail. He traces the trajectory their ship will take.
COOPER: Lose time? Roth shifts the hologram the stars and black holes flatten onto a sheet that bends, revealing the curvature of gravity.
ROTH: High speed or high gravity both slow down time, relative to earth.
COOPER: How much time?
ROTH: Based on the information from the probe as much as five years. Doyle looks at the tiny ship's trajectory, threaded between two black holes. He looks worried.
DOYLE: I still think we're making a lot of assumptions. About the wormhole. About the planet. ( points to map ) The critical orbit here is incredibly dangerous. It's like walking on the rim of the volcano.
BRAND: As long as we're careful, we'll make How do you know that?
DOYLE: How do you know that?
BRAND: I find it hard to believe that someone would build a wormhole to a planet with water and oxygen just to lead us to a dead end.
DOYLE: I thought you were a scientist, Brand. That sounds more like a hypothesis.
BRAND: A guess. That's right. We don't have time to wait for conclusive My guess is that the wormhole is there because someone is trying to help us. The same way we used to try to help animals when they were threatened with extinction.
COOPER: Sure. Till we ran out of food and ate all of them.
BRAND: ( ANNOYED )
DOYLE: What do you think, Roth? Roth leans forward, studying the map.
ROTH: If we're guessing, then I'd say Brand's right. The wormhole couldn't exist naturally. I think it's there for a reason. That someone is trying to help us. Brand looks satisfied.
DOYLE: So you think we'll have no problem navigating between two massive black holes to a tiny planet?
ROTH: I think we'll probably be killed. ( off his look ) I said I thought there was a plan. Not that the plan was for us to find a planet like Earth to save a handful of people.
DOYLE: If that's not the plan, then what are we supposed to be doing out there?
ROTH: ( SHRUGS )
BRAND'S FATHER: Tars here needs to be disassembled. I figured you could do the honors.
COOPER: ( to Tars, sarcastic ) I thought I was going to get to enjoy your company all the way to Mars. Tars hands him a plastic waterproof case.
TARS: You will. My chassis is too heavy for the rocket stage. They have another one waiting for me in orbit. Tars turns his back to Cooper. Two flaps on the back of his torso slide open, revealing his control module.
BRAND'S FATHER: It's noise. I know it's noise. But it looks too orderly. Probably just an old man seeing things.
COOPER: We'll be back. It sounds like he's trying to reassure himself as much her.
BRAND: I won't. Cooper looks at her, confused. As he does, the entire rocket SHAKES as the primary rockets begin to fire.
ENGINEER ROBOT: Would you like me to install the Oh, no. I want to see this. Cooper takes Tars's chip out of its plastic safety case and looks it over. The engineer opens a bay in the back of the frame and Cooper slides the chip inside. The frame begins its "handshake" lights illuminate on the body, muscles flicker from a long gestation. The eyes open.
COOPER: Oh, no. I want to see this. Cooper takes Tars's chip out of its plastic safety case and looks it over. The engineer opens a bay in the back of the frame and Cooper slides the chip inside. The frame begins its "handshake" lights illuminate on the body, muscles flicker from a long gestation. The eyes open.
TARS: I wouldn't call it that, exactly. He reaches out an arm and pats Cooper on the shoulder.
COOPER: The ship is tiny. Doyle, squeezing past him, smiles at Cooper's surprise.
DOYLE: So is the wormhole. Doyle pats Cooper on the back. Cooper begins hauling gear EXT. SPACE, NEAR EARTH ORBIT In complete silence, the Endurance detaches from the space station and rolls gently away. After a moment, its nuclear engines fire and the Endurance begins to accelerate steadily away from the Earth.
TARS: It's the comms relay. It will allow us to talk to earth, even on the far side of the wormhole.
COOPER: I know. So why are you painting it? Tars looks almost bashful.
TARS: It helps me calibrate my fine motor Sure it does.
COOPER: Sure it does.
TARS: I learned it during the war.
COOPER: What'd you paint?
TARS: Cooper watches him finish in silence.
TOM: They said I can start an agriculture class a year early. Cooper shakes his head.
DONALD: I'm sorry, Coop. I asked Murph to record you a message but he's still. well, he's still angry with you. I'll try again next week. The video cuts out. Cooper stares at the darkened screen.
TARS: Be careful. It's difficult to gauge mass in zero gravity.
COOPER: How much do these things weigh?
TARS: Four tons. Cooper looks at the incredibly heavy bundle spinning easily in his hands. He tries to stop it. Catches his hand.
COOPER: He jerks his hand away, then pushes himself after the spinning bundle, trying to stop it before it can damage the hull. Tars helps him catch it inches from the hull wall. Brand floats over to Cooper, smiling at him the whole time with an exaggerated grin.
BRAND: Cooper smiles, taken aback by Brand's sudden friendliness.
COOPER: Because it lowers your blood pressure.
BRAND: Because it lowers your blood pressure.
CASE: How are you feeling?
COOPER: Fine. The anesthetic is working.
CASE: No I mean how is your mood? You seem to be developing good relations with everyone on the mission. Except perhaps Ms. Brand.
COOPER: ( EMBARRASSED )
CASE: Only five percent of my resources are devoted to human anatomy. Ten percent is the mission protocol. The rest is human psychology.
COOPER: We are floating in a total vacuum in a plastic ship powered by nuclear engines. But the most dangerous thing onboard is the three pounds of organic material in your skull.
CASE: We are floating in a total vacuum in a plastic ship powered by nuclear engines. But the most dangerous thing onboard is the three pounds of organic material in your skull.
COOPER: If we're such a liability, why take us along? You and Tars could build the colony without us. You wouldn't need to bring food or oxygen.
CASE: Because humans, despite your obvious physical shortcomings, are better at surviving than we are. Your programming is better than ours.
COOPER: Humans aren't programmed. Case stops, looking Cooper in the eye.
CASE: Would you prefer I was honest? These things can be uncomfortable for Did they program you to be Yes. Of course.
COOPER: Did they program you to be Yes. Of course.
CASE: Yes. Of course.
COOPER: ( DEFENSIVE )
CASE: Exactly. You believe it so much you won't listen to me.
COOPER: How would that make us better at When I die, the last thing I will see will be a diagnostic of my own power cycle. Would you like to know the last thing you will see? Cooper hesitates. Case senses the jump in his heart rate.
CASE: When I die, the last thing I will see will be a diagnostic of my own power cycle. Would you like to know the last thing you will see? Cooper hesitates. Case senses the jump in his heart rate.
COOPER: No. I want to know.
CASE: The last thing you will see before you die will be your children.
COOPER: We've almost reached the wormhole.
BRAND: We'll be able to communicate with Earth even from the far side of the Cooper smiles, grateful for this small kindness.
COOPER: I know. Thank you.
BRAND: I can't imagine how tough it would be to leave your kids behind.
COOPER: You never had any? I thought I was a pariah for only having two.
BRAND: Hard to settle down when you've spent your life waiting to leave the planet. Cooper looks at the holographic model of the black hole system. The ice planet looks precariously balanced, orbiting the smaller black hole.
COOPER: Strange place to look for a new home.
BRAND: You wouldn't want to get too close to the surface of the sun, either. Black holes are a more stable supply of power than stars in many ways.
COOPER: You really think there's a plan?
BRAND: I hope so. ( looks at him ) You don't?
COOPER: I guess I just think we're on our Cooper looks at the impossibly complicated system of black holes orbiting each other.
CASE: Deploy the comms relay.
CASE: Everyone take their station for transit. We're heading into the wormhole mouth. Cooper and the rest begin folding away equipment in the control room and moving into the outer layer of the ship. Case initiates a sequence on the keypad and the nuclear engines disengage themselves from the ship.
TARS: Would you like me to make a joke?
COOPER: ( FIRM )
COOPER: Where are we?
ROTH: ( SMILING )
CASE: The hull is intact. Thirty more seconds transit. For a moment, the ship slides gently, silently, through the wormhole. The quiet is eery. Suddenly, a point of distortion appears in the hull next to Cooper. It looks like someone is pushing against the hull of the ship with a giant finger.
COOPER: Something's happening to the hull over here.
CASE: Hull integrity is fine. The distortion moves along the hull, growing in diameter.
COOPER: Well, I don't know what your display is telling you but something is happening over here. Suddenly, along the hull, Doyle speaks up, panicked.
DOYLE: I've got a problem over here, too. Doyle is watching a separate distortion move across the inner wall of the ship. This one seems to be TWISTING the material of the hull. Suddenly, the point in front of Cooper detaches itself from the outer wall and moves through the space in front of him, bending the empty space itself, distorting the ship behind it like a sphere-shaped magnifying glass.
ROTH: ( SMILES )
DOYLE: What the hell are they, Case?
CASE: I don't know. It could be gravitational turbulence. The twisting sphere in front of Doyle begins to grow.
DOYLE: It's getting bigger. Doyle puts up his hand to defend himself. The sphere absorbs it, twisting Doyle's hand. Doyle CRIES OUT. His hand is twisted completely around, impossibly mangled. But Doyle, hyperventilating, isn't in any pain.
ROTH: It's not bending your hand. It's bending the space around your hand. The sphere begins to pass through Doyle's body. Doyle is freaking out. The sphere in front of Cooper makes contact with him, also. He holds his breath as it touches him, squeezing and distorting his body.
BRAND: This isn't turbulence. Look at the way they're moving it's like something's examining us. Cooper watches the sphere distort his arm, running along the length of it.
COOPER: Can you ask it to stop? Suddenly, as quickly as they appeared, the distortions vanish. For a moment, the crew is silent, still spellbound by the An ALARM sounds. Suddenly, the inner chamber begins to distort from a spherical shape to bispherical: two spheres joined. The ship GROANS as if it's being pulled apart.
ROTH: The wormhole is splitting into two paths. Radiation is pouring from one path to the other.
CASE: Release the second mouth.
DOYLE: None of our testing involved opening the ship inside the wormhole. We have no idea what might happen.
CASE: We're going to find out. Doyle reaches over to an auxiliary panel and punches in a After a moment, the hull cracks open, creating a channel through which the radiating mouth can escape. The opening in the ship allows the pressure to begin to concentrate on one fracture point. The ship SHUDDERS as it's squeezed along its axis. Case punches in a code and the ship begins to close again, painstakingly slowly. Finally, the ship calms as it closes around the original wormhole.
ROTH: Look at that. Roth is looking through the translucent panel on the hull. They are on the warped side of the universe.
CASE: Reconfigure the engines and test the communications array. The crew break themselves away from the view and get to work. Roth begins adapting his models of the local system with the real observational data pouring in from the ship's Cooper pulls himself to the comms post. PINGS the relay they left on the far side of the wormhole.
COOPER: It's working. Tars finishes reeling the nuclear engines back in from their tether and locks them into place. Roth's updated model appears on the monitors. Brand stares at it, startled.
BRAND: We're moving.
DOYLE: That's not possible. We haven't activated the engines yet. The ship's skin illuminates, overlaying a plotted course on top of the view.
CASE: Roth. Why are we moving? Roth looks at the stars, then back to his model.
ROTH: The smaller black hole. We're much closer to it than the models predicted. We're being pulled by its swirl. Very quickly. The crew looks out through the hull. They are being pulled into Pantagruel's swirl a glittering disc of matter spinning at high speed around the hole. Doyle looks behind them. The wormhole mouth is rapidly growing smaller.
CASE: Doyle. Fire the engines. Now. The ship's engines FIRE, straining to fight the irresistible pull of the supermassive black hole. They won't be able to fight it for long.
DOYLE: We're being pulled into it?
ROTH: No. I don't think so. Roth looks at the instrumentation for a moment.
DOYLE: You don't know that. Case stares ahead into the darkness.
ROTH: We should turn off the engines. Let the swirl take us.
DOYLE: ( FRANTIC )
CASE: Shut down the engines. The engines shut down. SILENCE. The ship drifts for a moment in the swirl, then begins to move.
ROTH: It's the tidal gravity caused by the black hole. It means we're right on the critical orbit. The comms screen lights up, TONING again and again, as it receives a long garbled update. Then it shuts down. Cooper drags himself along the hull until he reaches the controls.
COOPER: We've lost contact with the relay. Case joins Cooper at the comms screen. While they're distracted, Doyle maneuvers himself over to the engine control.
DOYLE: I'm sorry. I can't let you kill us. We have to go back. The engines strain to fight the swirl but they're hopelessly outgunned by the gravity of the black hole.
DOYLE: Why isn't it slowing down?
ROTH: We're being pulled towards the event ALARMS begin sounding throughout the ship as the projected course on Roth's model shifts, showing the Endurance being pushed up the rim, past the critical orbit and down towards the black hole's event horizon. Case takes control of the ship, trying to fire the engines forwards to speed them back up to safety, but it's too late.
CASE: ( CALM )
ROTH: They would if we used it all at once. Cooper is still trying to understand what Roth means as Tars locks himself into the engine compartment.
COOPER: What is he doing?
BRAND: Saving us. Tars tears open the engine's control panel and begins overriding it.
ROTH: Prime the remaining engine. When he detonates it, we'll only have a few seconds. If we overshoot we could be pulled into the bigger hole. Roth moves to the controls.
CASE: Secure yourselves. The ship should be able to withstand the blast.
COOPER: What about Tars? As the crew watches, Tars continues to hold the engine even as the casing around it begins to melt. Finally, it EXPLODES.
CASE: It's going to be close, but we're going to make it. Brand looks at the instruments. Points to a tiny radar contact receding towards the massive black hole.
BRAND: Tars. His transponder is still The ship's instruments TONE every few seconds as it communicates with Tars' onboard computer.
ROTH: He's being pulled toward Gargantua. We can't help him. The crew watch, helpless, as the tones grow further and further apart. Then they stop. Cooper looks at Doyle, anger rising. Then he looks down.
ROTH: We're here.
COOPER: I still can't contact the relay. Brand ignores him at first. She nods at Case.
BRAND: I've already checked it. It's electromagnetic interference. We'll try again in a few hours. Cooper begins to ask her what's wrong, but she moves off. Roth looks up from his monitor, excited.
ROTH: I've got a signal. But it's local. A familiar CHIRP plays over the ship's speakers.
COOPER: How could they all have landed in the same place?
ROTH: ( SMILES )
COOPER: We're bringing him along?
BRAND: We need all the help we can get. Besides, the alternative is to leave him on the ship alone. You think he'll still be here when we get back? Cooper steps aside, allowing Doyle onboard.
BRAND: ( RADIO )
CASE: The other probes should be directly beneath us. Case and the others begin digging into the hillside. Cooper is drawn to a small mound in the middle of the valley, four feet high. He takes out a small folding shovel and begins scraping at the ice and snow. Case hits something solid. But it's not a probe. He digs around a little more, then reaches up and hacks away at the hillside, revealing the outline of something metal: A door. They're not standing at the base of a hill it's a shelter. The crew stands back, unsure what to make of it. A few feet away, Cooper cuts enough of the mound away to reveal something flexible fabric caked with ice. He scrapes away the snow, revealing a bright patch of red fabric: It's the flag of the People's Republic of China.
BRAND: How could the Chinese have gotten here first? The federal government kept the wormhole a secret. Case shrugs. He has a soldier's gallows humor about his old employer's ability to keep anything a secret.
CASE: They didn't do a very good job. Case reaches for the door of the shelter. It's sealed shut with ice. He wrenches it open.
DOYLE: The Chinese must have captured them. So they couldn't return to us. The crew stare at the probes for a moment, taking it in.
BRAND: Then how did the probe that Cooper found return?
ROTH: The more immediate question is what happened to the Chinese expedition. There's no sign of their ship in orbit. And they never returned to Roth picks up an ancient vacuum sealed package of pickled egg. Virtually none of the rations have been eaten.
BRAND: The whole place has been dosed with huge levels of radiation. What happened here? Cooper looks at the pieces of a modular, one-person rocket, a last-ditch means of escape, stored, untouched in the shelter. He steps back, realizing something.
COOPER: This is the Taichung mission.
BRAND: The Mars mission? The Chinese claimed it had been destroyed on landing. Cooper looks over the relay log.
COOPER: They never landed. Not on Mars. Four human crew, fifteen robots. The log says the base has been here for thirty years. Case's familiar voice comes through the radio.
DOYLE: It goes down for a hundred and fifty feet, then stops. Tunnel's old the ice has reformed at the bottom.
BRAND: I'm going to descend to take some samples. Cooper, want to make yourself useful? Cooper begins to say something, then bites his tongue.
COOPER: The entire human crew is buried out there in the snow.
ROTH: I think I know what killed them. This planet isn't the only thing orbiting this black hole. Roth zooms the monitor in, revealing a tiny, impossibly-bright object appearing at the horizon of the black hole.
BRAND: How long do we have left?
ROTH: About five minutes.
COOPER: Then what?
BRAND: Then we die. The radiation will cook us alive. Cooper looks around, their predicament settling in. Case walks over to the edge of the mine shaft.
CASE: We have to go down.
COOPER: What about returning to the ship?
BRAND: Not enough time. Case is right. The ice can shield us from some of the x-rays.
DOYLE: It would take a thousand feet of ice to shield us. Brand gives up on the argument, sheds her equipment and clips herself to the line to follow Case down into the ice. Cooper looks at Doyle, then follows her.
COOPER: What is this?
BRAND: A pocket formed by gas. There may be more below. The ice below them reveals nothing but murky blackness. Case has found some of the equipment left behind by the Chinese a battery-powered drill and a pick.
DOYLE: We'll never make it far enough down.
BRAND: Shut up. How much time do we have, Roth checks his watch with his usual detachment.
ROTH: About three minutes or so until we're fully exposed. The rad meter Brand is holding begins to CHIRP with activity the radiation levels are rising. The ice will not be enough to protect them. Cooper sees that Brand has exhausted herself with the pick. He takes over for her. The drill that Case is operating GROANS as the thirty-year- old battery runs out of charge. Case casts it aside and begins SMASHING at the ice with his bare hand. Brand is looking at the walls of the ice pocket, looking for fissures. Her lights pick out something in the ice. She
BRAND: I've found something. Case continues to pummel the ice with his hand, which is badly smashed.
ROTH: It's not your light they're responding to. It's this Roth takes the depth meter and waves it over the ice. Suddenly, the black flecks begin to shine.
BRAND: X-rays. They feed on them and emit visible light. They've found a way to survive here. Roth looks at the shimmering light of the tiny life-forms trapped in the ice, mesmerized. Case hammers down with his arm, gouging a deep hole in the ice below. Suddenly, GAS sprays back up at him. He's found the gas pocket beneath them. Too late. Roth's rad meter begins BEEPING frantically.
BRAND: ( looks at rad meter ) They're absorbing most of the x-rays.
ROTH: Not enough, unfortunately. Suddenly, a CRACK as Case punches into the ice. Cooper looks down a great fissure has opened in the ice beneath them.
COOPER: Case, wait Case PUNCHES again. Suddenly, with a great BANG, the ice floor disintegrates beneath them. They fall into the darkness.
COOPER: Breathe. Trust me. She refuses at first. Water is bubbling into her suit through the open mask. Finally, she takes a deep breath.
BRAND: What do you mean, you're going to let go?
COOPER: Take a deep breath. Brand takes a deep breath and Cooper lets go of her.
BRAND: I don't need your help.
COOPER: I thought we were supposed to be a collective organism. She gives up and lets him help her out of the water. They sit together, soaking wet, trying to catch their breath.
BRAND: Thank you.
COOPER: Don't mention it. Cooper feels the rocks beneath him, which are translucent, like glass, and polished to an impossible shine. He looks up to see Case dragging Roth and Doyle, still in their suits, out of the water.
BRAND: Oxygen atmosphere. Pure water. Temperate climate.
COOPER: Looks like we can climb up the mountains back to the ice. We're down to three suits. We'll have to send someone ahead to get a fourth.
BRAND: I won't need one.
DOYLE: Why not?
BRAND: Because I'm not going anywhere. This is our new home. Brand picks up some of her instruments and a sample case and hikes into the jungle.
COOPER: Any sign of Brand?
ROTH: She's still taking samples. If you find her, tell her to head back. Night should be falling soon.
COOPER: What happens then?
ROTH: Your guess is as good as mine. Cooper hikes into the jungle to look for Brand.
BRAND: This is incredible. The organisms trapped in the ice above absorb x- rays and emit light. In return, these plants absorb the light and emit oxygen, which feeds the animals trapped in the ice. Brand cuts off a sample and drops it into the case. The transparent wall of the case magnifies the structure onto the glass automatically. She compares it with the flecks she collected in the ice above, fascinated.
COOPER: Any sign of big life-forms?
BRAND: The soil's been disturbed. So something's been moving. But I haven't seen anything. ( notices his look ) Cooper. are you nervous? Cooper stops scanning the trees, embarrassed.
COOPER: I just think we should get back to the shelter before night falls. Overhead, the light from the ice above begins to fade the neutron star must have orbited out of view. Night is falling.
BRAND: ( LAUGHING )
COOPER: You don't know that. You just have blind faith this place is going to be some kind of Eden. Brand stops. He's struck a nerve.
BRAND: ( truly pissed off ) Faith has nothing to do with it. You know what you are, Cooper? You're just another in a long line of people saying 'no.' That this isn't going to work. And frankly, I don't have to convince you.
COOPER: What's that supposed to mean?
BRAND: You're on this mission because you're another pair of hands. You want the truth? I told Case we should bring another robot over you. At least then I could just reprogram you to- She stops. Something has caught her attention.
COOPER: Nothing. I just I could have sworn it just moved. She walks to the thick, knotted trunk of a tree. Puts a hand on it. Overhead, the ice flickers out and the darkness begins to descend, more rapidly than on Earth. Suddenly, the tree SHUDDERS. Then, the bark begins to ooze over Brand's fingers. Brand snaps her hand away and steps back. Even for her, this is too much. She turns back to Cooper, who is looking at the jungle around them, spooked.
BRAND: Nothing. I just I could have sworn it just moved. She walks to the thick, knotted trunk of a tree. Puts a hand on it. Overhead, the ice flickers out and the darkness begins to descend, more rapidly than on Earth. Suddenly, the tree SHUDDERS. Then, the bark begins to ooze over Brand's fingers. Brand snaps her hand away and steps back. Even for her, this is too much. She turns back to Cooper, who is looking at the jungle around them, spooked.
COOPER: You know how plants don't usually move? Is that a universal rule?
BRAND: No. There really aren't any rules. All around them, the life-forms begins to melt toward the ground, breaking down into different, smaller forms.
COOPER: Hello there. The creature lurches toward him on three legs, then its head splits open and it BELLOWS.
COOPER: We have to reach the shelter. They head off, crashing through the melee.
DOYLE: I think we've got a problem. Case and Roth look up to see the organisms picking up speed as they move towards them. Roth begins to step out towards them.
ROTH: Fascinating. I think- Case grabs him by the arm and pushes him bodily into the shelter after Doyle. Case pushes the door closed.
COOPER: This way. Brand begins to follow.
BRAND: No. wait. Too late. Cooper forces his way between two writhing creatures, steps through, and falls.
COOPER: I've got you. Suddenly, the branch in Cooper's hand illuminates and wrenches itself out of the rock it's a limb of a huge colony organism. It shakes Cooper loose and they fall again.
BRAND: I've got you. Creatures begin splashing down into the pool behind them, as if imitating them. Cooper stumbles to his feet and Brand guides them backward into a small cave carved into the rock above the pool.
BRAND: It's game theory. The best move is always to cooperate at first.
COOPER: By "cooperate" do you mean let it eat me?
BRAND: These organisms have no interest in us. They survive by photosynthesis. All they need is light.
COOPER: Then why are they killing each other?
BRAND: I don't know.
COOPER: ( trying to be calm ) What is it doing?
BRAND: It's a colony organism. It's trying to incorporate you into its structure.
COOPER: I don't want it to incorporate me.
BRAND: Don't open your mouth.
COOPER: WHY N-
BRAND: No. They don't bleed. they don't die. they're just competing. trying out different shapes, looking for the best one.
COOPER: I'd say they have a long way to go.
BRAND: ( AMAZED )
COOPER: But what are they competing for?
BRAND: I don't know. Brand shivers it's getting colder.
BRAND: These creatures are billions of years older than we are. But they're relatively primitive. They haven't developed tools, culture, language.
COOPER: Why not?
BRAND: I don't know. No one knows how intelligent life began on Earth. But the surface of this planet has virtually no craters. No impacts. It's been sheltered by the local black holes.
COOPER: What difference would that make?
BRAND: Maybe not enough has gone wrong here. Maybe bad luck is the key to intelligent life.
COOPER: ( QUIETLY )
BRAND: Exactly. Maybe our interaction with them will push them over the top. Maybe that's part of the plan.
COOPER: ( shakes his head ) The plan.
BRAND: Why is it so hard for you to accept that someone might be trying to help Cooper is silent for a moment. His mood darkens.
COOPER: I was in Denver during the first year of the famine. I was just a kid. We kept waiting for someone to come help us. People starved to death sitting on the ground, waiting for someone to come.
BRAND: They're not going to move now, Cooper. They need to spread themselves as thin as they can to absorb the light.
DOYLE: Looks like the Chinese picked a fight with the locals.
COOPER: Looks like they lost. They continue through the ruins.
DOYLE: Look at the size of this place. They built it for thousands of people. But no one came. Brand looks around, determined.
BRAND: They will. We can salvage it. This place will save us years.
COOPER: But why didn't they come?
BRAND: ( SHRUGS )
BRAND: What happened here? Roth stares at the ball, intrigued.
ROTH: They were testing something. Cooper looks at the walls, which are bowed inwards.
COOPER: Testing what? Roth is looking at the ball, which appears to have been built from layers of different material. The outermost layer is flattened steel.
COOPER: Everything in here is bolted down. ( looks at sphere ) What do you think this thing does?
ROTH: ( EXCITED )
COOPER: I wouldn't turn it on until we can figure out what it does, Roth. Roth continues to look over the controls, oblivious.
CASE: I've found the Chinese mission logs. They're encrypted. Cooper walks over. Looks over the terminal.
COOPER: Old military-grade encryption. It's not very robust. ( looks at Case ) No offense. Hang on. Cooper punches a few keys into the terminal. Opens up the terminal. Scans the motherboard. Takes Case's rifle and SMASHES one of the chips on the board. The terminal comes to life. Cooper hands Case his rifle.
CASE: They got here twenty years ago. The human crew was killed by radiation the first day. But the robots survived. They built the colony and radioed home. But they didn't receive a response.
COOPER: No one was listening.
CASE: ( SCANS DOCUMENT )
DOYLE: What problem?
CASE: It doesn't say. Their science team took the ship to continue exploring the system. It says they found some kind of.
BRAND: Where did they go?
CASE: I don't know. They've deleted their mission plan. There's nothing else.
DOYLE: I think I know what the problem is. Doyle is manipulating the time component of the map, slowing down the passage of time, reversing it, speeding it up.
COOPER: How long does this place have?
CASE: A few years. A decade at most. Doyle turns to Brand.
DOYLE: So much for the plan. Cooper looks at Brand. She is in disbelief, staring as a lifetime's training and optimism are torn to pieces.
BRAND: But I don't understand. why are we here? What are we here for? Cooper looks down. Brand's upset is turning to anger.
COOPER: ( GENTLE )
CASE: It's nighttime. The native life- forms are mobile again. The RUMBLE grows more intense, as if the entire building is being gently shaken.
COOPER: No. It's closer than that.
DOYLE: What the hell is happening? Case doesn't answer he's looking up at the control equipment for the holographic display, which is GROANING under a load it was never built to handle. Case grabs Cooper and Brand and pushes them towards the stairwell as the control panel TEARS free of the floor and CRASHES towards them. Cooper falls into the stairwell now they're being pulled up and sideways through the stairwell, like an Escher Brand pushes Cooper out of the way as debris from the control panel orbits past them back up towards the lab. They try to hang on but the force is becoming irresistible, dragging them along the wall of the stairwell and back towards the lab upstairs. Brand wedges herself against the railing as objects and debris are SMASHING against the door to the lab. Doyle is trying to hang onto the handrail but his grip slips and he CRIES OUT as he falls towards the door to the lab, SMASHING it open. Doyle disappears up and into the lab. Cooper slips trying to help Doyle. Brand reaches out for Too late. Cooper is pulled through the open door.
ROTH: The control panel is beneath you. See if you can turn it off.
COOPER: ( YELLS UP )
COOPER: They found a way to make gravity.
ROTH: Not make it. Adjust it. Dial it up, or down. I think they were experimenting with it firing these into the black hole to try to save this planet.
DOYLE: All that from one tiny box. Roth has hooked the box up to a terminal and it scrolling through the incredibly sophisticated machine code, trying to parse how it works. Cooper looks on.
ROTH: ( AMAZED )
COOPER: What does that mean?
ROTH: It means whoever built the wormhole probably doesn't exist inside our Cooper looks at the tiny box.
COOPER: But how did the Chinese develop the technology? This would take decades, maybe hundreds of years, to create.
CASE: Wherever they went, they found something that allowed them to build Brand looks at the box.
ROTH: They came back here and tried to use these devices to save this planet. But they didn't work. Nothing would be strong enough to weaken a black Maybe we could work with it. Try to improve it.
BRAND: Maybe we could work with it. Try to improve it.
ROTH: No. You're missing the bigger picture. The robots had strict mission parameters. They were told to build a colony and report back. They tried to. But they failed. Like us they were fixated on this Cooper looks at Brand.
BRAND: And go where?
ROTH: Wherever we want. We don't belong in any one place. Can't you see that now? Not Earth. Not this place. Nowhere. If the human race is going to survive, we need to keep moving. Split up. Spread out. Fly. With this, we can. Case looks at the box. Makes a decision.
CASE: In the morning we're taking this and going home. Doyle, Roth and Case set about making preparations to leave gathering space suits, equipment. In the bustle, Cooper finds Brand sitting alone, staring at the sample of fractal life.
COOPER: I know this isn't exactly what you trained for. But I think Roth might be right.
BRAND: That doesn't help this planet. This creature is doomed. Unlike us it doesn't have anywhere to go. The fractal organism almost seems to be looking at her, trying to comprehend. But it quickly loses interest and goes back to breaking itself into pieces and reforming into different shapes, trying to escape. Brand sets it back down.
CASE: We need to hurry. We only have a few hours to reach the ice before Cooper stops. He puts a hand on Brand's shoulder. He points to the tree line. Something is moving.
COOPER: Don't make any sudden movements. They can't hurt us if we're unarmed.
BRAND: Suddenly, three ROBOT MARINES step out of the jungle, weapons raised. They are wearing ghillie suits, pieced together from dried dead pieces of the local foliage. Under their camouflage, they looks identical to Case. With one key difference faded red and gold insignias. Case steps protectively in front of his team. The CHINESE OFFICER steps forward, rifle levelled.
CHINESE OFFICER: Ni Hao. My name is Technical Sergeant Liu, 177th reconnaissance Marines, Army of the People's Republic. Welcome to New China.
CASE: This is a scientific expedition, not a military one. We are making our way back to our ship.
LIU: I'm afraid I cannot let you do that. We will provide food and shelter and await further instructions.
BRAND: This planet is being pulled into the black hole. We all need to leave.
LIU: We will await further orders.
COOPER: Further orders aren't coming. Your government is gone. It ran out of money, same as ours. You're on your We can offer you food and shelter as long as you require. The facilities here are quite comfortable. Liu's tone remains polite, but there's no hope of changing his mind. Cooper takes a sidelong glance at Brand.
LIU: We can offer you food and shelter as long as you require. The facilities here are quite comfortable. Liu's tone remains polite, but there's no hope of changing his mind. Cooper takes a sidelong glance at Brand.
COOPER: ( LOW )
BRAND: ( TO LIU )
LIU: Our mission was to prepare for the evacuation. This site was deemed This device that you have built this could save millions of people. We need to get it back home. Brand points to the device Roth is holding. The Chinese robots seem particularly unhappy with this development.
BRAND: This device that you have built this could save millions of people. We need to get it back home. Brand points to the device Roth is holding. The Chinese robots seem particularly unhappy with this development.
LIU: These technologies are the property of the People's Republic.
ROTH: Following? Following where? Liu pauses.
LIU: We will await further orders.
ROTH: Your name means six. Where did the others go? One through five? Is that who were not supposed to follow. Case turns to look at Cooper.
CASE: ( LOW )
COOPER: Come on. Cooper picks up the rifle from the destroyed marine and begins hiking up the mountain.
BRAND: We can't leave them all to die. She hefts the case and they begin climbing up into the ice.
BRAND: Was that the last of them?
DOYLE: We're not going to stick around to count them. Let's get out of here.
COOPER: We're too late. Cooper points to a damaged section of the ship's hull the marine has torn open a section, revealing damaged hardware.
DOYLE: What about the escape rocket at the Chinese base camp? One of us could fit into it.
BRAND: It doesn't matter how many of us make it. We have to get this back to earth. Roth looks at the moons orbiting overhead.
ROTH: Can the secondary thrusters still fire on the lander? Doyle looks over the craft.
DOYLE: Sure. But we don't have nearly enough power for lift off. Roth holds up the small gravity black box.
ROTH: ( SMILES )
ROTH: I can reach one of the moons in low orbit and turn up its gravity. As it passes overhead it should be able to slingshot the lander away from the planet's surface.
COOPER: But we need to take the box back to You don't need this only the idea. The knowledge of how to build it. Cooper remembers something. Heads back into the shelter.
ROTH: You don't need this only the idea. The knowledge of how to build it. Cooper remembers something. Heads back into the shelter.
COOPER: I'm going to image the operating code and the architecture onto the probe's hard drive. It'll be garbled, but it should give you and me enough to rebuild it when we get back. Cooper looks at the probe filling up with data.
ROTH: Not me. But you'll make it work. The transfer is complete. Roth hands Cooper the probe, and takes the black box himself.
BRAND: This isn't right, Roth. We can find a way for all of us to leave.
ROTH: This is the only way. Keep the lander upright and fire the secondary boosters when the moon passes Let me take it.
COOPER: Let me take it.
ROTH: No. You need to make it home. You're going to need to build more of these. Brand looks at him, heartbroken. Roth smiles.
BRAND: ( NODS )
ROTH: Brand turns to follow Cooper back. Behind her, Roth's rocket LAUNCHES on an explosive cloud. In seconds it's high overhead.
DOYLE: Control systems inside are online.
COOPER: We're going to find out soon enough. Brand is looking off into the distance.
BRAND: Someone's coming. Cooper looks up. A robotlike figure is limping through the snowstorm towards them. Cooper raises the rifle. Finally he makes out the insignia it's Case. Cooper and Doyle run out towards him. They reach Case as he collapses in the snow. He's badly injured one leg torn off at the knee, one arm mangled. Doyle and Cooper drag the crippled robot back into the ship.
DOYLE: Close the door. Cooper moves to the door. Something's wrong.
COOPER: Where's Brand? She's nowhere to be seen. Cooper looks out onto the ice. Brand is heading back out into the snow.
BRAND: ( RADIO )
COOPER: ( RADIO )
BRAND: Between you and utter solitude, Cooper, frankly, I'm not sure. They reach the apex of their climb and the gravity of the planet begins to win out. For a moment they float.
COOPER: Guess you were right too much gravity, or not enough. He smiles, forgetting their predicament for a moment. They stare into each other's eyes. Then they begin, very gently, to fall back towards the ice Suddenly, the lander maneuvers beneath them. The airlock opens to catch them Doyle is at the helm. Brand and Cooper pull themselves aboard.
COOPER: He's gone. Ahead, a shadow looms in the darkness: the Endurance.
BRAND: He's gone. Ahead, a shadow looms in the darkness: the Endurance.
DOYLE: I'm setting a course for the wormhole. They're going to make it. Cooper and Brand make eye contact Brand gives him a tiny awkward smile. He returns it, then descends below.
COOPER: How is that working?
CASE: Very well, thank you.
COOPER: Good. We've already set the course, skipper. We're going home. Cooper hauls himself back up into the observation level.
BRAND: We're safe now. Cooper heads to the communications equipment.
COOPER: Now I know why we weren't able to hit the relay. It's not interference the blue-shift from the black hole is more than we thought it would be. Cooper begins re-calibrating the equipment.
BRAND: ( CONFLICTED )
COOPER: ( THINKS )
BRAND: ( QUIET )
COOPER: How much?
BRAND: A lot. Cooper, maybe it's best if
COOPER: Forty seven years. Doyle joins him, staring at the screen, stunned.
DOYLE: My kids. Cooper tries to PING the relay again. Nothing comes back.
BRAND: ( GENTLE )
COOPER: We could bypass the relay. Send a conventional shortwave signal.
BRAND: Only a tiny portion of the signal would make it though the wormhole. Besides, no one will be listening The comms screen is dead. No movement. Nothing. Cooper looks at Brand, realizing something.
COOPER: You knew, didn't you? You and Case figured it out when we landed. Brand looks down.
BRAND: I thought. I couldn't be sure.
COOPER: Sure you could. You're brilliant. You know everything.
BRAND: Cooper. we needed to keep going. I'm so sorry. Your children.
COOPER: They're not children any more. if they're even still alive. He turns away from her.
BRAND: Listen, the important thing is that we're going home, now. And we have something that can save everyone. It's more important than the people we left behind- Doyle cuts her off, filled with anger.
DOYLE: That's easy for you to say. You didn't leave anyone behind. Cooper looks at Brand, his anger softened by sadness.
COOPER: Yes she did. Brand looks at him, grateful for this small kindness.
BRAND: He's gone. But there are other people who still need our help. There's still time. The ship's controls TONE in ALARM. Brand and Cooper turn: Case is standing at the controls.
LIU: I'm sorry. I have my orders. No one follows. Liu stares, satisfied, as the nuclear engine spins away from the ship and back down toward Pantagruel. Cooper SMASHES Liu from behind. The robot tumbles to the ground, the fight gone out of him. Cooper and Doyle roll the robot over and Cooper reaches for his control module.
BRAND: No. We're being pulled back to Cooper, frantically checks the controls, firing the remaining We can't let that happen. We'll lose more time. too much. The boosters are no match for the deadly pull of the black hole below them. On the ship's guidance, they watch, helpless, as the ship climbs back up the volcano rim towards the critical orbit. As on their first trip, the black hole grows to dominate the bottom of the sky, and the stars above them become streaks time is speeding for them as they are whirled down into the deep gravity well around the hole. As they watch, trapped, decades begin to play out in the system above them. They watch as the ice planet whirls around them, orbiting the black hole dozens of times.

DOYLE: The wormhole. Look it's being pulled into the black hole as well. They watch on the holographic model as the wormhole's orbit converges on the event horizon of the black hole.
BRAND: It's orbit mirrored the ice planet's.
COOPER: What will happen to it?
BRAND: It'll be destroyed, like everything Cooper struggles to pull himself over to the communications screen. Sets it to make a shortwave broadcast. Brand opens her mouth to point out that it's futile, then stops.
COOPER: ( INTO RADIO )
FORMALITIES ): Murph, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't make it back, like I promised. He hangs up the radio. In silence, they watch as the wormhole their only way home vanishes beneath the event horizon.
DOYLE: How much time are we losing?
BRAND: ( HEARTBROKEN )
COOPER: All of those people back home. none of them will make it. As Doyle watches the controls the ship continues to spiral towards the black hole.
DOYLE: This is it. We're going to be pulled Cooper looks at the controls, an idea forming. He pulls himself down. Hauls himself across the deck to pick up Liu's chip. He plugs it into a diagnostic tool.
BRAND: What are you doing?
COOPER: Case said the Chinese found something else. The location was scrubbed from their records. But I bet he knows it. Cooper fires up the chip. Begins sorting through the onboard Doyle watches the instruments.
DOYLE: Hurry up. Cooper concentrates, poring over the numbers. Finally he begins feeding coordinates into the navigation computer.
COOPER: Here. Can we reach it? Brand looks at the map. The point appears on the far side of Gargantua. Brand studies the trajectory.
BRAND: We can use the thrusters to keep us on the critical orbit. Then slingshot us towards Gargantua. The thrusters STRAIN to push the ship back up towards the critical orbit.
GARGANTUA: EXT. SPACE AROUND GARGANTUA The ship picks up more and more speed as it soars closer to the massive black hole's event horizon.
DOYLE: We only have a few minutes before we're swallowed into that thing. What are we even looking for? On the radar, a tiny empty spot appears.
COOPER: ( points to screen ) That? What is it? Brand looks. In one tiny region on the back side of the black hole, the debris simply seems to vanish.
BRAND: It's another wormhole. Doyle FIRES the thrusters again, pushing the ship towards the wormhole.
DOYLE: We're not going to be able to slow down. Hold onto something. He locks up the controls.
COOPER: Where are we?
BRAND: I don't know. It's like we entered the wormhole and never left it. Brand checks the instruments. There is nothing for the ship to model. There is nowhere to go. They drift.
BRAND: I'm sorry. I should have told you. I didn't have the right.
BRAND'S FATHER: I'm not going to make it much longer. The machines will continue to maintain the station as long as they can and the communications will run as long as the station here still has power. I'm sorry. I hope wherever you are, darling, you're safe. The screen cuts out. Brand watches the static play out.
BRAND: Our last trip past the black hole cost us another 100, maybe 200 years. Which means there's a good chance we're the only humans alive anywhere.
TOM: Hi, Dad. Cooper pauses it. He can't take it. After a moment, he lets it run again.
TOM: I've got a surprise for you, Dad. You're a grandpa. Tom holds up an infant wrapped tight in swaddling. The kid is BAWLING.
MURPH: Hello, Dad. You sonofabitch. He laughs, self-conscious.
COOPER: Not a single drink on the whole ship. What kind of mission is this?
BRAND: I think Doyle's been experimenting with the coolant from his spacesuit. They sit in silence for a moment.
COOPER: You really think we're the last humans alive anywhere?
BRAND: I don't know. Maybe. ( looks him in the eye ) So that's it, then? That's all? He looks down, saddened by his own words.
COOPER: So that's it, then? That's all? He looks down, saddened by his own words.
BRAND: ( QUIET )
COOPER: What about the plan? The grand I thought you didn't believe in one.
BRAND: I thought you didn't believe in one.
COOPER: I didn't. But you were bringing me He laughs, his anger coming and going in waves.
BRAND: I don't know. Maybe it just adds up to this.
COOPER: This? You're saying the end result of ten billion years is the atoms from dead stars standing here disagreeing with each other. She smiles at him. Bittersweet.
BRAND: Maybe that's enough. He turns away from her. She takes his shoulder. She pulls him into a kiss. His surprise disappears and he pulls her to him, kissing her back. Their surroundings forgotten, they drift. She LAUGHS gently as they bump into a wall and he pushes off of it, sending them spinning back into the center of the cabin. She pulls his shirt off and it hangs in space. In moments, the cabin is filling with discarded clothes, different colors and shapes, like a ticker tape parade. In the center of the cabin, Brand and Cooper make love.
DOYLE: They just appeared. A sphere of distortion, like the one they encountered in the first wormhole, is directly in front of Doyle, hovering at a point in the middle of the cabin. Doyle points a finger gently at the sphere, which grows in Brand pulls herself into the cabin. Several more points appear, as if they've been summoned by the first. Some of the points twist, some of them spin, and some of them are motionless.
BRAND: I think these are the creatures that built the wormhole. One of them begins to move closer to Cooper.
COOPER: This thing is made of. gravity?
BRAND: No. I don't think it's in our universe at all. I think it lives in the bulk the space that the wormholes traverse. And it can only interact with us using gravity. The shape playfully grows around Cooper's hand, bending the space it's in, stretching the skin. Doyle GASPS as the sphere nearest him moves through his body, coming to rest in the middle and bending his entire torso like a fun house mirror. Suddenly, the sphere wrapped around Cooper's hand begins moving, tugging him gently through the cabin. In the next moment, all three of them are being propelled through the cabin. It's a magical moment a communion, a dance between creatures on either side of a massive, invisible wall. Doyle exclaims like a kid on a roller coaster as he is whirled around the room.
COOPER: Can we communicate with them?
BRAND: Where would we even start? Maybe She pull a bag of ball bearings out of a storage bin and tears the bag open, releasing a cloud of the tiny shining globes into the air. For a moment, nothing happens. Then, the distortions begin moving through the bearings, shifting them, rearranging them into patterns in the air. First, they rearrange the ball bearings into clusters, then shapes spinning around each other planets orbiting around a medium-sized star.
DOYLE: That's our solar system. After a moment the ball bearings break apart again and rearrange into a larger, more complicated system Gargantua, Pantagruel, and the ice planet. Finally, the bearings compress to a two-dimensional sheet. Inside the sheet, one solitary ball bearing orbits around the stars and then pushes up, off of the sheet, into an umbrella shaped space that rises up from the sheet.
COOPER: What is that? Brand looks at the tiny particle, floating alone above its That's us. That's where they've brought us. We're in the bulk. Cooper and Doyle stare at the particle. The map is static Cooper looks around. The distortions have gone. The instruments on the ship TONE in alarm. Cooper walks through the map, sending the ball bearings scattering. He hurries to the instruments. The ship is moving picking up speed at a huge rate.
BRAND: That's us. That's where they've brought us. We're in the bulk. Cooper and Doyle stare at the particle. The map is static Cooper looks around. The distortions have gone. The instruments on the ship TONE in alarm. Cooper walks through the map, sending the ball bearings scattering. He hurries to the instruments. The ship is moving picking up speed at a huge rate.
DOYLE: They stand, looking out into the perfect darkness.
COOPER: There's something out there. The cluster of lights grows as they are propelled closer:
TARS: ( DEADPAN )
TARS: I orbited the black hole seven times before I hit the second wormhole. Then I drifted until I found this Cooper looks around. The halls are filled with countless technological wonders.
COOPER: This is what the Chinese were How they could have built all this in just a handful of years.
TARS: They didn't. It took them four ( off Brand's look ) Time moves very slowly here
BRAND: How do you know?
TARS: Because I've been waiting for you for three hundred years. Brand looks around at the massive facility.
BRAND: Time. That's what the bulk beings wanted to give us. That was the treasure the Chinese found. Enough time to let us save ourselves. Brand looks around. The facility is massive. She sets the specimen case down on a table. Even the tiny creature seems in awe of the place.
TARS: I have catalogued almost everything they had built here.
COOPER: Must have taken you a while.
TARS: One hundred and fifty-seven years. Cooper shakes his head in disbelief.
COOPER: How are they keeping the lights on in this thing? Tars, in answer, points to a far door.
TARS: Follow me.
TARS: It's a mini black hole. A remnant of the big bang. It will power this place forever. Tars leads them on.
COOPER: It's a map?
TARS: No. Not a map. This is a simulation of the Earth. A perfect simulation. Tars touches the control panel. The map zooms in over Europe. Down onto Paris. Late 20th century: People walk through the streets. A woman stops at a newsagent to buy a newspaper. Tars touches the controls again and the map zooms out.
COOPER: So why didn't they return? Why didn't they save us? Brand is staring at the massive map.
BRAND: Because they were too late. By the time they found this place, the people who sent them were dead. They were unable to fulfill their mission. Tars points to the next room.
TARS: That was the final problem they tried to solve. Tars moves on.
BRAND: Where do they lead? Tars looks at an illuminated schematic on one wall, mapping some of the wormholes.
TARS: There are millions of them, connecting virtually every planetary system in the universe. There are thousands in our galaxy alone. But the Chinese stopped mapping them when they found what they were looking for. Tars walks further. He stops. The platform in front of them is dominated by a gigantic version of the black box that Roth found on the ice planet, connected to a massive power array, and pointing into the dark space above the sphere.
DOYLE: What does it do? Cooper steps forward. Runs a hand on the cold, strange material the antenna is made out of. He knows exactly what it does.
COOPER: They weren't interested in the other wormholes because their mission was to return home. That one leads back to Earth. The Earth they were told to return to. Tars walks to the controls for the device.
BRAND: But that's impossible. Tars turns away from the machine.
TARS: It was only used once. The Chinese team attempted to travel back in time, to Earth just a few years after they had left.
COOPER: Did they make it?
TARS: I don't know. Doyle looks back to Cooper.
DOYLE: Do you really think it works? Cooper looks up at the machine, suddenly determined.
COOPER: We're going to find out. Cooper walks out of the room. Brand follows him.
BRAND: You know it doesn't work. Time travel isn't possible.
COOPER: You don't know that.
BRAND: Yes, I do. If it worked, the Chinese would have suddenly discovered all of these incredible technologies. But they never made it.
COOPER: I made a promise. He turns away from her, resolute.
BRAND: I came to say goodbye. Cooper looks up at her.
COOPER: You could have taken one of the other This one's done all right by us so Brand holds up a small sample case containing half of the fractal life-form.
BRAND: This one's done all right by us so Brand holds up a small sample case containing half of the fractal life-form.
COOPER: Where are you going to go?
BRAND: I don't know. Up there, I guess. She points up into the great darkness above them. Tars steps down. Moves over to them.
COOPER: You're going, too?
TARS: I'm curious. It's my nature. See you down the road? Tars shakes Cooper's hand. Heads onto the Endurance.
BRAND: Come with us. Please. You wanted your whole life to explore. This is your chance. Cooper stares at her. This is what he has always wanted. And he has to turn it down.
COOPER: I'm sorry. I have to find out what happened to my sons. I promised Brand sees the resolve in his eyes. Knows there's no way to change his mind.
BRAND: You're a man who keeps his promises. Make me one- She takes his hand.
COOPER: I promise. They kiss passionately. Not wanting it to end but knowing that it must. Reluctantly, they separate. Brand turns back to the ship. She pulls herself onto the ship. Cooper steps back outside and watches through the tiny window as the Endurance lifts off and disappears into the darkness. Cooper turns away.
DOYLE: Let's go home. The two men sit in silence as the ship arcs away from the space station and closes in on the wormhole. Cooper hears a familiar CHIRP. He turns around:
COOPER: The probe. Doyle looks back.
DOYLE: We get back to earth, you and I can try to make sense of the code. Rebuild the gravity machine. Cooper stares at it, suddenly realizing something. He unbuckles himself. Cooper stands and walks over to the probe. Traces the familiar stars and stripes carved into its side. Cooper stares at the probe, putting it all together.
COOPER: It's going to work.
DOYLE: Of course it's going to work.
COOPER: That's not what I mean. This is the probe I found in Galveston. Below them, the wormhole breaks as it reaches another wormhole mouth that the Chinese have dropped down to a lower gravity well, creating a time machine. The wormhole mouth is FLARING with radiation.
DOYLE: I don't know what you're talking about, but you're not touching the controls. I'm going home.
COOPER: You don't need to do this. We won't make it back, but this does. The secrets are already right on it. Maybe someone found it. There's But we don't get to go with.
DOYLE: You're not stopping me. I'm going Doyle forces Cooper into the ship's lander. Then he closes the airlock. Cooper pounds on the other side of the glass, trying to reason with him. The landing craft detaches from the ship.
MURPH: It's done. Auto-pilot's packed up for the last time.
FARMER: You can't make it work a little Can't do anything for you. There aren't any more parts for these. Not anywhere.
MURPH: Can't do anything for you. There aren't any more parts for these. Not anywhere.
FARMER: You don't understand. We're getting less than a hundred pounds per acre. We need to plant more, not less. Murph looks around him at the pathetic crop of corn that stretches around them. The plants are feeble, barely able to support themselves.
MURPH'S WIFE: Would you get that thing off of the Murph nods, absorbed. Keys in a final tweak to the decryption software. Hits return. Suddenly, the screen begins filling with data. Murph stares at it, wide eyed.
EMILY COOPER: Dad? You said you'd take us to the Did I? He looks at the impossible nest of wires. Shakes his head.
MURPH: ( DISTRACTED )
EMILY COOPER: ( staring at machine ) What is it supposed to do, Dad?
MURPH: I have no idea. Murph switches off the lights and they walk out. After a moment, the radio CRACKLES to life in the darkness.
COOPER: ( over radio, garbled ) This is the crew of the Endurance. Murph. I'm sorry. The signal crackles out.
MURPH: Where's Emily?
WIFE: Out in the barn. She's been tinkering with your old projects.
EMILY COOPER: Dad. I'm sorry. I made some changes to the machine. I think I did something wrong. Murph puts an arm around his daughter and as they watch, the entire barn IMPLODES. Their tractor begins sliding towards the wreckage of the barn, chunky tires plowing up the soil. Finally, the RUMBLING STOPS as the power lines short out in a FIERY display. As the dust clears, Murph and his daughter examine the mess: The entire barn has been crushed into a tiny ball. Murph looks at his daughter.
MURPH: Do you remember what you changed? Wide-eyed, she thinks about it. Then nods.
BLACK: FADE IN:
DOCTOR: Good morning. Don't go outside just yet, Mr. Cooper.
COOPER: Where am I?
DOCTOR: ( SMILES )
COOPER: What's coincidence? What is this We have a lot to show you. The doctor reaches for the curtains. She offers him a hand. Cooper declines the help and steps outside.
DOCTOR: We have a lot to show you. The doctor reaches for the curtains. She offers him a hand. Cooper declines the help and steps outside.
DOCTOR: You're OK. We get this from people who move here from planetary colonies all the time.
COOPER: Where. where are we?
DOCTOR: Like I said. It was a coincidence. There was a facility closer to Earth, but they had a problem, so you wound up here. ( off his look ) This is the Space Station Joseph A. Cooper takes in the incredible surroundings. A thousand feet above them, black specks are sprinkled over an ocean of green Jersey milking cows grazing in a field of wild grass.
DOCTOR: He was moved here after they found you. He's a little old for a transfer, but they made an exception. Cooper hovers at the back of the room, unsure. He turns to the doctor, questioning. Then he notices the pictures on the old man's desk: There are dozens of them. Children, grandchildren. Then the older ones the man's own parents. Grandparents. Cooper spots a tiny framed picture with someone he recognizes: Murph, 80 years old, surrounded by his daughter and her family. They are standing in front of a re-opened Cape Canaveral, and a huge spaceship under construction. Cooper picks up the picture and stares at it. The doctor points to a shy little boy hiding behind Murph's leg in the picture.
ADMINISTRATOR: You're a hero, Mr. Cooper. Let's just start off by saying that. It's an incredible and. unexpected honor to have you here with us. Cooper smiles, uncomfortable.
COOPER: The rangers who found you reported that you had released a sample of an alien life-form into the wild. Which is, unfortunately, against It was last of its kind. Their planet was destroyed. The administrator cues up a series of images on his computer.
ADMINISTRATOR: The rangers who found you reported that you had released a sample of an alien life-form into the wild. Which is, unfortunately, against It was last of its kind. Their planet was destroyed. The administrator cues up a series of images on his computer.
COOPER: It was last of its kind. Their planet was destroyed. The administrator cues up a series of images on his computer.
ADMINISTRATOR: The rangers attempted to isolate the life-form, but it had already spread out of control. It seems to be He shows Cooper a satellite image of north america. A considerable portion of the frozen tundra is glowing. Cooper begins laughing. Which makes the administrator even less comfortable.
COOPER: Because that was the plan.
ADMINISTRATOR: Whose plan?
COOPER: ( SMILES )
ADMINISTRATOR: My assistant tells me you've applied for a position with the exploration Feel like I should be pulling my That's admirable, Mr. Cooper. The truth is, most of the fleet's personnel are automated. There are a small number of crewed ships. But there are great numbers of candidates. Very well trained candidates.
COOPER: Feel like I should be pulling my That's admirable, Mr. Cooper. The truth is, most of the fleet's personnel are automated. There are a small number of crewed ships. But there are great numbers of candidates. Very well trained candidates.
ADMINISTRATOR: That's admirable, Mr. Cooper. The truth is, most of the fleet's personnel are automated. There are a small number of crewed ships. But there are great numbers of candidates. Very well trained candidates.
COOPER: I was hoping to enroll in a course. Try to get myself up to speed on the new systems.
ADMINISTRATOR: I don't want you to take this the wrong way, Mr. Cooper like I said, you're a hero. But the truth is we have somewhat limited resources. Cooper remembers this conversation. He looks down.
COOPER: No one's heard anything from Brand?
ADMINISTRATOR: I'm sorry. Officially, she's been listed as missing for over 200 years. Mind you, I guess you turned up eventually, didn't you?
COOPER: Am I really going to hurt anybody by going to look for her? I just need a small ship. I made a promise. The bureaucrat looks down. Is he really going to have to tell this guy the lay of the land?
ADMINISTRATOR: Listen. Mr. Cooper. You're a hero. You're the oldest man in the human race. Don't you want to take it ( off his look ) I hope you understand, we all you hold you in the highest possible Which is why they're never going to let you go off by yourself in a spaceship. I'm sorry. Cooper looks at his hands. He's got a couple centuries on the bureaucrat in Earth years, but looks ten years younger. He puts his hands in his pockets.
ROBOT: Settings: general settings, security
SETTINGS: Curiosity. New level setting. 100 Confirmed. Would you like to make any additional changes?
COOPER: Curiosity. New level setting. 100 Confirmed. Would you like to make any additional changes?
ROBOT: Confirmed. Would you like to make any additional changes?
COOPER: Sense of humor. New level setting. 100 percent. Wait.
COOPER: Where do you want to go first? The robot thinks it over.
