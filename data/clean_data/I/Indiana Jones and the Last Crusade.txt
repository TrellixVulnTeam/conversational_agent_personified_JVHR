JEFF BOAM: GEORGE LUCAS MENNO MEYJES
GEORGE LUCAS: MENNO MEYJES
MENNO MEYJES: FADE IN: EXT. DESERT OF THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST - DAY A mountain peak dominates the landscape.
OFFICER: RIDERS climb down from their mounts. and only now do we realize that this is a TROOP OF BOY SCOUTS, all of them about thirteen years of age. The "Commanding Officer" is only their SCOUTMASTER, Mr. Havelock. One of the Scouts, a pudgy kid named HERMAN, steps away from his horse, bends over and pukes. The other Scouts rag on him.
FIRST SCOUT: Herman's horsesick! A BLOND SCOUT, however, befriends Herman. He has a thatch of straw-colored hair and the no-nonsense expression common to kids whose curiosity and appetite for knowledge exceed what they teach in school. Additionally, he has adorned his uniform with an authentic HOPI INDIAN WOVEN BELT.
SCOUTMASTER: Chaps, don't anybody wander off. Some of the passageways in here can run for miles. Two Boy Scouts climb up the rocky base of the cliff.
HERMAN: I don't think this is such a good LAUGHTER is HEARD; the Blond Scout pulls Herman forward toward its source. The VOICES GROW LOUDER now as the boys get closer to their source. The light of kerosene lanterns dances on the tunnel walls ahead. The boys approach cautiously, careful to stay hidden.
HERMAN: What is it? This is what they see: FOUR MEN digging with shovels and pick-axes. They have broken into one of the pueblo's SECRET CHAMBERS. called "Kivas." The men are ROUGH RIDER ( his name describes his dress ), ROSCOE ( a Bowery Boy bully of 14 ) and HALFBREED ( with straight black hair that cascades over his shoulders ). And the fourth man wears a LEATHER WAIST JACKET and BROWN FELT FEDORA HAT. He has his back turned to us, but we would be willing to bet anything that this is INDLANA JONES. However, when the man turns, and his face is illuminated by the lantern's glow, we are shocked to discover that it is someone else. We'll call him FEDORA.
FEDORA: Alfred, did you get anything yet?
MAN: Nothing. Dig in.
ROSCOE: Hey, I've got something! Whoops from the other men.
ROSCOE: I got something, Garth!
ROSCOE: I got something. I got something right here. More whoops from the other men. FEDORA puts the box on the rock next to the lantern. HALFBREED pushes ROSCOE as he jumps with excitement. ROUGH RIDER steps forward to look at the box as Fedora opens it.
ROSCOE: ( more whoops; then ) ( more whoops )
HALFBREED: Shut up. Shut up. FEDORA takes a BEJEWELED CROSS from the box and holds it aloft. Fedora's comrades practically salivate at the sight of it.
HERMAN: Indy? Indy? What are they doing? Indiana? Indiana?
INDY: FEDORA blows dust from the Cross, turning it in his hand, silently appraising its beauty. and its value. He seems aloof from the others; somehow superior to INDY stays hidden, but is astounded by what he sees.
HALFBREED: Hey, we got to find more stuff to bring back. INDY stays hidden, but is astounded by what he sees.
INDY: ( hushed; urgent )
INDY: That Cross is an important artifact. It belongs in a museum. A look of resolve comes into INDY's expression, and he turns back toward
INDY: Run back and find the others. Tell Mister Havelock that there are men looting in the caves. HERMAN doesn't seem to be listening. Instead, he watches in wide-eyed horror as a SNAKE SLITHERS ACROSS HIS LAP.
INDY: Have him bring the sheriff. INDY matter-of-factly picks up the snake and tosses it aside. HERMAN gasps.
INDY: It's only a snake. INDY grabs HERMAN's scout scarf and pulls him closer.
INDY: Did you hear what I said?
HERMAN: Right. Run back. Mister Havelock. The Sheriff. What, what are you gonna do?
INDY: I don't know. I'll think of INDY releases the scarf, gives HERMAN a pat and Herman dashes off. Indy sees the Cross on the rock next to the lantern. As the Robbers continue to search for additional valuables, Indy is able to work his way unseen to within arm's reach of the Cross. FEDORA looks over at the men digging in a hole b.g.
FEDORA: Dig with your hands. INDY picks up the Cross.
ROSCOE: He's got our thing!
HALFBREED: Get 'im!
INDY: Mister Havelock! Anybody Everybody's lost but me! He hears RUNNING FOOTSTEPS BEHIND HIM and dashes off. ROUGH RIDER, HALFBREED, and ROSCOE are quick to appear and run after him.
FEDORA: There he isl
MEN: ( AD-LIBS ) Let's go! Let's get him! Let's Indy jumps from one rock to another; the SCOUT TROOP HORSES are below. Indy puts two fingers in his mouth and WHISTLES for his horse, who trots over. Indy puts the Cross in his belt. INDY PREPARES TO JUMP into the saddle. Hesitates. Then. he JUMPS. But the horse moves exactly at the wrong moment and Indy lands flat on his feet in a standing position. The impact sends a shock wave up his body that rattles his back teeth. Indy stands up and successfully mounts his horse. FEDORA AND HIS MEN ARRIVE at the roof's edge in time to see INDY climb into the saddle and gallop off.
INDY: Hyahl Hyah!
ROSCOE: Hey! Come back here! FEDORA puts two fingers in his mouth and WHISTLES. and A VINTAGE TRUCK AND AUTOMOBILE come ROARING OUT from behind the Pueblo ( Driven by two more gang members ). Now we glimpse.
PANAMA HAT: Come on. Get him! INDY SPURS his mount on to greater speeds but the autos not only keep pace with his horse. they begin to squeeze in on it. Speeding Autos. Thundering hooves. Rushing wind. Flying dust. INDY crouched low and leaning forward in the saddle, his heart pounding, his adrenalin INDY VEERS OFF in a new directiontoward a RAILROAD TRACK.
ENORMOUS ANACONDA: The head of this snake is so damn big, it looks more like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
INDY: INDY jumps back in horror. only to land with a SQUISH into the SNAKE VAT.
INDY: Oh. Oh. Hundreds of slippery, squirming snakes. INDY sinks into them. They cover him. Engulf him. Almost smother him. INDY jumps out of the side of the vat, freeing himself. INDY locates a clean-out door at the bottom of the car and uses it to escape. HALFBREED, meanwhile, tries to open the closed window of the car. He groans. ROUGH RIDER moves to assist him.
ROUGH RIDER: Here, let me.
INDY: Holy smokes!
FEDORA: Come on, kid. There's no way out of this. As INDY edges away from FEDORA, a portion of the STOCKCAR'S ROOF COLLAPSES and Indy FALLS THROUGH into the car below.
INDY: INDY's eyes take a moment to adjust to the dark. A bit of sunlight leaks in through the cracks between the boards. Then INDY sees it. At the far end of the boxcar. Rising slowly to its feet. an AFRICAN LION. The Lion ROARS. The boxcar walls shake. Indy gasps. Dust swirls up into the shafts of sunlight. And INDY has one more surprise in store: The Cross of Cortes has been dislodged from his belt during the fall. INDY glances around, sees a coiled LION TAMER'S WHIP hanging on a nail. He carefully takes it down by the handle. The Lion sees this and GROWLS SOFTLY. INDY swallows hard and gives the whip a try. It unravels awkwardly, its TIP flying back and HITTING INDY IN THE FACE. CUTTING his chin. The Lion GROWLS LOUDER. Indy quickly gathers up the whip, wets his lips, and tries again. This timesuccess! The WHIP CRACKS SHARPLY. The Lion BELLOWS and SWATS the air. and steps back. INDY looks amazed and delighted. He CRACKS the whip again. The Lion backs away even more. Indy inches forwardbends down ( never taking his eyes off the Lion )picks up the Crossand steps back again, sweat pouring down his But now. how to get out? He looks up at the opening through which he fell and sees FEDORA LOOKING DOWN AT HIM. Fedora extends his hand.
FEDORA: Toss up the whip.
FEDORA: You've got heart, kid. ( indicates Cross )
INDY: ( takes Cross from his belt ) It belongs to Coronado.
FEDORA: ( overlapping ) his grandchildren.
INDY: This should be in a museum.
ROSCOE: Now give me thatl
FEDORA: Don't let him get awayl
INDY: He glances back at the men and quickly opens the door to the caboose, stepping FEDORA puts out his arm, gesturing for the others not to follow INDY.
FEDORA: Hold it. Make sure he doesn't
FEDORA: Okay, kid. out of the box. FEDORA smiles confidently and advances toward the box. The box unexpectedly collapses; all four sides flop away. revealing NOTHING. INDY has completely FEDORA is mystified, frustrated and angered. Then he feels a breeze at his back. He turns and discovers that the caboose door is open. He rushes out onto the balcony and sees: INDY RUNNING along the tracks, turning up a street of modest clapboard houses.
FEDORA: EXT. STREET - SMALL TOWN - DAY as INDY runs from the railroad tracks and approaches his house we see the name "JONES" painted on the mailbox.
INDY: INT. THE HOUSE - DAY INDY bursts through the front door holding the Cross in his hand. A Husky BARKS as Indy runs past in search of his father.
INDY: INT. THE STUDY - DAY INDY charges in. The study is cluttered with books. Pictures, charts and maps clearly reflect the father's passion for Medieval studies. PROFESSOR HENRY JONES is absorbed at his desk. In fact, he is studying a very ancient parchment volume which lies open on the desk. The page shows a beautifully illuminated picture of what might be a stained-glass window. The sketch incorporates a series of Roman numerals. The Professor is not just studying it, he is copying it into his own notebook.

INDY: It's important!
HENRY: It's important!
INDY: It's important!
HENRY: Then waitcount to twenty.
INDY: No, Dad. You listen to me
HENRY: ( now he shouts )
INDY: One, two, three, four. Now we see what HENRY is concentrating on. We see his hand sketching; then, he holds up one finger.
HENRY: In Greek. INDY's reaction:
INDY: ( louder, in Greek )
HENRY: May he who illuminated this. illuminate me.
HERMAN: I brought the Sheriff. HERMAN means the SHERIFF, who now enters the house.
INDY: Just the man I want to see! Now, there were five or six of them.
SHERIFF: ( interrupting )
INDY: ( overlapping )
SHERIFF: You still got it?
INDY: Well, yes, sir. It's right here! INDY shows the CROSS, more or less handing it to the SHERIFF to make his point. The Sheriff takes it casually.
SHERIFF: I'm glad to see that. because the rightful owner of this Cross won't press charges, if you give it back. FEDORA enters the house, followed by ROSCOE, ROUGH RIDER and HALFBREED. He politely removes his hat and holds it in his hand. He nods at INDY in a friendly manner.
SHERIFF: He's got witnesses, five or six of them. The SHERIFF and FEDORA are in Cahoots The SHERIFF hands the Cross to FEDORA. ROSCOE reaches in and takes it from Fedora, then runs out the door.
ROSCOE: As ROSCOE runs outside INDY seesthrough the screen doorthe MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT waiting patiently beside the car that is parked out front. Roscoe approaches and gives the Man the Crossthe Man hands Roscoe some money in exchange. The SHERIFF tips his hat and leaves.
SHERIFF: Good day. FEDORA remains behind for a moment. He turns and speaks to INDY in an ironic man-to-man way.
FEDORA: You lost today, kid, but that doesn't mean you have to like it. Then, FEDORA takes off his hat and takes a step towards INDY. He holds the hat by the crown, and puts it on Indy's head, a show of respect and admiration for the boy. The hat blocks Indy's face.
PANAMA HAT: Small world, Doctor Jones.
INDY: Too small for two of us. THE MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT ( years older now ) removes the CROSS OF CORONADO from Indy's belt.
PANAMA HAT: This is the second time I've had to reclaim my property from you
INDY: That belongs in a museum
PANAMA HAT: So do you. Throw him over the side.
PANAMA HAT: Grab him, he's getting away! Grab him! Indy turns around and pummels two sailors with one punch. Indy sees a large Stevedore's hook above him and he climbs up on crates to reach it. He grabs a hold of the hook and uses it to swing all the way across the deck, narrowly avoiding a huge wave behind him. He jumps into the rollicking ocean, still holding onto the cross. On the ship, a giant fuel drum rolls wildly, falling directly onto a crate of TNT. The crate explodes, causing the entire ship to blow, sending an enormous orange fireball into the sky.
BARCELONA: A SHREDDED PANAMA HAT floats past.
INDY: . the search for fact. Not truth. If it's truth you're interested in, Doctor Tyree's Philosophy class is right down the hall. INT. CORRIDOR - DAY So forget any ideas you've got about lost cities, exotic travel, and digging up the world. Eve do not follow maps to buried treasure and "X" never, ever, marks the spot. MARCUS BRODY approaches Indy's classroom. He peers through the window in the door to see INDY completing his lecture.
INDY: So forget any ideas you've got about lost cities, exotic travel, and digging up the world. Eve do not follow maps to buried treasure and "X" never, ever, marks the spot. MARCUS BRODY approaches Indy's classroom. He peers through the window in the door to see INDY completing his lecture.
INDY: Seventy percent of all archaeology is done in the library. Research. INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY BRODY enters the lecture hall and stands at the rear of the room.
INDY: We cannot afford to take mythology at face value. The BELL RINGS. INDY stands at his desk as students begin to disperse. A pretty coed puts a note on the desk.
INDY: Next week: "Egyptology." Starting with the excavation of Naukratis by Blinders Petrie in 1885. I will be in my office if anybody's got any problems for the next hour and a half. BRODY approaches as the last of the students leaves the lecture hall.
INDY: ( slaps his pocket ) I did it!
BRODY: You've got itl INDY removes the cloth-wrapped Cross from his desk. He places it on the desk and takes off his glasses as BRODY examines the Cross.
INDY: You know how long I've been looking for that?!
BRODY: All your life.
INDY: All my life!
BRODY: Well done, Indy. Very well done, indeed This will find a place of honor in our Spanish collection. INDY gathers up his books and makes his way toward the door.
INDY: We can discuss my honorarium over dinner and champagne tonight. He turns back toward BRODY, now holding the Cross.
INDY: Your treat.
BRODY: Yes. My treat.
INDY: Shush! Shush! Shushl INDY shoulders his way to the desk of his secretary, an overwhelmed Teaching Assistant named IRENE.
IRENE: Doctor Jones! I'm so glad you're back! Your mail is on your desk. Here are your phone messages.
MALE STUDENT: Doctor Jones, you promised. Doctor Jones
IRENE: This is your appointment schedule. And these term papers still haven't been graded. INDY takes the term papers then turns to enter his PRIVATE OFFICE. Students once again CLAMOR for his attention: "Doctor Jones!" "Wait, Doctor Jonesl" "My grade!" "Sign my registration card!" INDY silences the mob with a raised hand.
INDY: ( very efficiently ) Okay. Irene, put everyone's name on a list, in the order they arrived, and I'll see each and every one of them in turn. The Students descend upon poor IRENE, each claiming to be first. INDY slips into his -
PRIVATE OFFICE: where he goes to his desk and finds a thick envelope with a foreign postmark on it.
INDY: ( softly; reading ) "Venice, Italy." Then, INDY stuffs his mail into his coat pockets, goes to the WINDOW, slides it open and STEPS OUT INTO THE GARDEN.
MAN: Doctor Jones?
DONOVAN: I trust your trip down was comfortable, Doctor Jones. My men didn't alarm you, I hope. He shakes hands with INDY.
DONOVAN: My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.
INDY: I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones, I have a passion for antiquities. Have a look over here. This might interest you.
DONOVAN: Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones, I have a passion for antiquities. Have a look over here. This might interest you.
INDY: Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid- Twelfth Century, I should think.
DONOVAN: That was our assessment as well.
INDY: Where did this come from?
DONOVAN: My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper. Can you translate the inscription? Translating the inscription is no easy matter, even for someone as knowledgeable as INDY.
INDY: ( stumbling through it ) ". who drinks the water I shall give him, says the Lord, will have a spring inside him welling up for eternal life. Let them bring me to your holy mountain in the place where you dwell. Donovan pours champagne into several fluted glasses as Indy reads.
INDY: Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon, to the Temple where the cup that" Suddenly INDY stops and looks up at DONOVAN with a startled expression.
INDY: "Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever. "
DONOVAN: ( reverently ) The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of INDY rubs his chin with a dubious expression as he takes the glass of champagne DONOVAN now offers him.
INDY: The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before.
DONOVAN: Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail. Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!
INDY: An old man's dream.
DONOVAN: Every man's dream. Including your father's, I believe. INDY stiffens slightly at the mention of his father, nods.
INDY: Grail lore is his hobby. He's a teacher of Medieval Literature. The one the students hope they don't get. The door opens and MRS. DONOVAN steps into the room. She's a matronly woman in an expensive evening gown.
MRS. DONOVAN: Walter, you're neglecting our Be along in a moment, dear. He leans over and kisses her cheek. MRS. DONOVAN sighs to herself and returns to the party. INDY, meanwhile, has turned his attention back to the Grail Tablet, obviously hooked by its archaeological promise. He moistens his finger with champagne and rubs it over the tablet. DONOVAN steps up next to Indy.

INDY, meanwhile, has turned his attention back to the Grail Tablet, obviously hooked by its archaeological promise. He moistens his finger with champagne and rubs it over the tablet. DONOVAN steps up next to Indy.
DONOVAN: Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail!
INDY: What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
DONOVAN: Just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently INDY has to shake his head at DONOVAN's apparent lack of judgment.
DONOVAN: Let me tell you another "bedtime story, " Doctor Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact.
INDY: I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to ato a Franciscan friar, I think.
DONOVAN: Not "supposedly," Doctor Jones. DONOVAN produces an ANCIENT LEATHER-BOUND VOLUME with very brittle pages. INDY views the manuscript with considerable interest.
DONOVAN: This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the Knight's story. it doesn't reveal on location of the Grail, I'm afraid. but the Knight promised that two "markers" that had been left behind would. This Tablet is one of those "markers." It proves the Knight's story is true. But as you pointed outit's incomplete. Now, the second "marker" is entombed with the Knight's dead brother. Our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice, Italy. As you can now see, Doctor Jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago. We're only one step away.
INDY: That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your You could be more right than you We've hit a snag. our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail.

INDY: You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my We already have. Your father is the man who's disappeared.
DONOVAN: ( after a pause ) We already have. Your father is the man who's disappeared.
BRODY: Your father and I have been friends since time began. I've watched you grow up, Indy. And I've watched the two of you grow I've never seen you this concerned about him before. They climb the porch and notice that the front door is ajar. They exchange a quick look of concern as they enter.
INDY: ( to BRODY )
INDY: Dad? Dad?
BRODY: Dear God.
BRODY: What has the old fool got himself into now?
INDY: I don't know. But whatever it is, he's in over his head! BRODY picks up some mail from Henry's cluttered desk.
INDY: It's today's mail. And it's been INDY turns and sees the pile of torn papers and envelopes. Then something hits Mail! That's it, Marcus! He immediately empties his pockets of his own mail taken earlier in the day from his college office and finds the envelope with the Venice postmark.

INDY: Mail! That's it, Marcus! He immediately empties his pockets of his own mail taken earlier in the day from his college office and finds the envelope with the Venice postmark.
INDY: ( as he tears it open ) Venice, Italy!
BRODY: What is it? INDY uncovers a small book. It looks like a JOURNAL or DIARY. Indy flips through it: Page after page of handwritten notes and drawings. BRODY glances at it with great curiosity.
INDY: It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?
BRODY: I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
INDY: Do you believe, Marcus? As INDY asks the question, he turns to a PAINTING on the wall: A depiction of Christ on the Cross, his blood being captured in a golden chalice. A SECOND PAINTING on the wall shows Eleventh Century Crusaders plummeting to their deaths over a high cliff. One Crusader, however, floats safely in midair because he holds the Grail in his hands.
INDY: Do you believe the Grail actually The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us. BRODY sees that INDY is unsatisfied by this response.
BRODY: The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us. BRODY sees that INDY is unsatisfied by this response.
BRODY: But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith.
INDY: Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice I'll tell him we'll take two.
BRODY: I'll tell him we'll take two.
BRODY: Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?
DONOVAN: ( overlapping ) Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
BRODY: ( overlapping ) ( overlapping ) I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
DONOVAN: ( overlapping ) I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
BRODY: Oh, well. That's good. Thank BRODY and DONOVAN shake hands. INDY steps from the back seat of the limo. He turns back to Donovan and shakes his hand.
DONOVAN: Doctor Jones. Good luck. Be very careful. Don't trust anvbody.
INDY: Ah, Venice.
BRODY: Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
INDY: I don't know. Maybe he'll know Suddenly a WOMAN comes up to him. Attractive features. Blonde hair. Eyes that are bright and intelligent.
ELSA: Doctor Jones?
INDY: I knew it was you She looks at him with an appraising expression that is brazenly flirtatious.
ELSA: I knew it was you She looks at him with an appraising expression that is brazenly flirtatious.
ELSA: you have your father's eyes.
INDY: And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you.
ELSA: Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for. INDY grins, enjoying the repartee. The WOMAN turns to BRODY, who tips his hat.
ELSA: Marcus Brody?
BRODY: That's right. The Woman, DR. ELSA SCHNEIDER, extends her hand to BRODY.
ELSA: ( introducing herself ) Doctor Elsa Schneider. INDY's grin fades. BRODY registers a look of surprise.
BRODY: Uh. how do you do?
ELSA: The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.
INDY: Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy! INDY can't take his eyes off ELSA. Perhaps he's feeling a bit like a schoolboy himself right now. As they cross over a bridge to the opposite side of the canal, Indy steals a flower from a street vendor. He holds it out to Elsa.
INDY: Frauleinwill you permit me?
ELSA: I usually don't.
INDY: I usually don't either.
ELSA: In that case, I permit you. INDY gives her the flower.
INDY: It would make me very happy.
ELSA: But I'm already sadby tomorrow it will have faded.
INDY: Tomorrow I'll steal you another.
BRODY: ( cutting in ) I hate to interrupt youbut the reason we're here
ELSA: ( interrupting ) Yes. I have something to show She hands a slip of paper to INDY.
ELSA: I left your father working in the library. He sent me to the map section to fetch an ancient plan of the city. When I got back to his tablehe'd gonewith all his papersexcept for that scrap which I found near his chair. INDY extends the scrap of paper to BRODY.
INDY: Roman numerals.
ELSA: Here is the library. They have arrived at the front steps of the library.
INDY: That doesn't look much like a It looks like a converted church. ELSA leads the way inside.
BRODY: It looks like a converted church. ELSA leads the way inside.
ELSA: In this case it's the literal truth. We're on holy ground. These columns over here. She indicates FOUR HUGE MARBLE COLUMNS that go from floor to ceiling.
ELSA: . were brought back as spoils of war after the sacking of Byzantium during the Crusades.
ELSA: Now please excuse me. The library's closing in a few moments. I'll arrange for us to stay a little The minute ELSA is out of earshot.
INDY: MarcusI've seen this window INDY whips out the Grail Diary and opens it to the sketch he noticed in the Right here. In Dad's Diary. You see? BRODY glances at the Diary, then at the windownoticing that the Roman numerals in question have been worked into the window's design.
BRODY: INDY whips out the Grail Diary and opens it to the sketch he noticed in the BRODY glances at the Diary, then at the windownoticing that the Roman numerals in question have been worked into the window's design.
INDY: Right here. In Dad's Diary. You see? BRODY glances at the Diary, then at the windownoticing that the Roman numerals in question have been worked into the window's design.
BRODY: Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!
INDY: Dad was onto something here!
BRODY: Well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still don't know what they mean. INDY and BRODY now see ELSA approaching. Indy quickly tucks the Diary back into his pocket.
INDY: ( explaining to Brody ) My dad sent me this Diary for a reason. Until we find out why, I suggest we keep it to ourselves.
ELSA: Find something? INDY doesn't reply. He's looking in five directions at once. His eyes moving across the walls and ceilingscharged with the thrill of discovery.
BRODY: ( to ELSA ) Uh, yes. Three, seven and tent That window seems to be the source of the Roman numerals.
ELSA: My God, I must be blind
INDY: Dad wasn't looking for a book about the Knight's Tomb. he was looking for the Tomb itself ELSA wears a blank expression.
INDY: Don't you get it? The Tomb is somewhere in the library! You said yourself it used to be a church! Look. INDY's eyes travel up one of the four huge marble columns.
INDY: INDY looks again to the stained-glass window. He points.
INDY: INDY has discovered that each Column is numbered with a Roman Numeral. Indy hurries away toward Column VII. All BRODY and ELSA can do now is try to keep up with him.
INDY: He points again to the stained-glass window.
INDY: Seven. Ten. He looks down to the scrap of paper in his hands.
INDY: And ten. Now where's the ten? Look around for the ten. INDY walks past aisles of book-lined shelves. He stops, turns, then looks down.
INDY: Three, seven and ten.
INDY: ( wryly; to himself ) "X" marks the spot. INDY rushes down the staircase and goes to the CENTER TILE where the two sides of the X intersect. He blows dust away from the tile and tries to pry it up, but cannot. INDY rushes past BRODY to a cordon held in place by a brass stand underneath the stained-glass window. INDY raises the brass stand and timing his actions, hits the tile precisely as the Librarian stamps a book. The Librarian regards the stamper curiously.
INDY: You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your Except he's lost, and I'm not.
ELSA: You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your Except he's lost, and I'm not.
INDY: Except he's lost, and I'm not.
ELSA: Lower me down. INDY is impressed with Elsa's spirit, and cooperates agreeablyholding her by the hands and lowering her into the hole. When her feet finally touch ground below, Indy releases his grip on her and slips the Grail Diary to BRODY.
INDY: Look after this for me, will you? Then INDY disappears into the hole.
INDY: Come on. INDY and ELSA glance around. This is really a horrid place. Dark and dank. foul smelling. Elsa turns. She removes a cigarette lighter with a unique ivory four-leaf clover design. INDY and ELSA inspect markings carved onto the walls.
ELSA: Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
INDY: Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
ELSA: The Christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later. INDY takes the lighter from her and lights their way down a dark passageway.
INDY: That's right. If there's a Knight of the First Crusade entombed down here, that's where we'll find him.
BRODY: Ohhhh. . . KAZIM gestures with his gun toward the now-unconscious BRODY. The other two men take Brody's hands and drag him into one of the book-lined aisles.
ELSA: What's this one? INDY only has to give it a quick glance to know.
INDY: The Ark of the Covenant.
ELSA: Are you sure?
INDY: ( deadpan ) Pretty sure. INDY holds the lighter up and he and ELSA enter another dark passageway.
INDY: Watch out. ELSA now holds the lighter as INDY rams his shoulder into the wall. The wall collapses on impact and Indy falls through into another room.
INDY: Petroleum. I could sink a well down here and retire. INDY reaches up and tears a piece of cloth from one of the skeletons, which breaks apart and falls into the oil-slick water. INDY uses the scrap of cloth and a bone to fashion a crude torch, which he then dips into the oily water.
INDY: Give me the lighter.
INDY: Oh, rats. ELSA gasps as the rats scamper between her legs. INDY moves forward through the rat-infested water as ELSA follows, still gasping in horror. Suddenly he slips into a hole. Recovering his balance, he reaches out to Elsa.
INDY: Come onl She gasps once again, terrified. INDY lifts her and carries ELSA as he moves THE CATACOMBS - THE HOLE IN THE WALL KAZIM and his men step to the opening Indy made earlier and shine their flashlights through to the rat-infested water.
INDY: Come here.
INDY: Look. . . In the center of the chamber, jutting up above the water, is what amounts to an "island altar" on which SEVERAL ANCIENT COFFINS rest. They move toward the INDY and ELSA begin to inspect the ornately carved COFFINS like the scholars of antiquity that they are. These are big oak caskets held together by straps of etched brass.
INDY: It must be one of these.
ELSA: Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork. One coffin is elevated above the others.
ELSA: It's this one. Together they begin to push on the lidSTRAINING and GROANING until it slides away and BANGS against the stone platform.
INDY: This is itl we found it! Look the engraving on the Shield. It's the same as on the Grail Tablets The Shield is the Second Marker! INDY unfolds a piece of paper and holds it over the shield.
ELSA: What's that?
INDY: It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet. The missing portion of the rubbing is completed by the shield.
ELSA: Just like your fathergiddy as a schoolboy. INDY laughs.
ELSA: Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?
INDY: ( chuckles ) He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them!
INDY: Get back! Back against the wall. INDY braces his back against the altar and TOPPLES THE COFFIN with his feet. It CRASHES against the stone platform and SPLASHES into the water.
INDY: Quick! Under it! They jump into the water beside the bobbing, overturned coffin.
INDY: Air pocket! ELSA hesitates. INDY literally DUNKS her and pushes her underneath.
INDY: Don't wander off.
ELSA: INDY disappears under the water and swims out from under the coffin.
ELSA: UNDER THE WATER INDY swims, looking for an escape route.
INDY: I think I've found a way out. Deep breath. ELSA groans. They take a deep breath and both dive under the water.
INDY: ( wryly )
INDY: ( to ELSA ) Are you crazy?! You don't go between them! ELSA can barely hear INDY over the noise of the motor.
ELSA: Go between them? Are you crazy?! INDY finally delivers the punch that sends the Turkish Agent flying overboard. Turning, Indy sees that ELSA has committed the speedboat to a course BETWEEN the two Freighters, now being pushed even closer together by a Tugboat.
INDY: I said go around!
ELSA: You said go between them!
INDY: I said don't go between them! It's purely academic at this point since the hulls of the the two Freighters loom up on either side of them like cavern walls.
KAZIM'S SPEEDBOAT: matches Indy's move for move.
ELSA: INDY kicks KAZIM in the face, knocking him into the water, then pulls him back into the boat, now being SUCKED THROUGH THE CHURNING WATER toward the Steamer's giant propeller blades.
INDY: Why are you trying to kill us?
KAZIM: Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
INDY: My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him Where is he? Talkor you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
KAZIM: Where is he? Talkor you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
INDY: Where is he? Talkor you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
KAZIM: If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
INDY: Then we'll die.
KAZIM: My soul is prepared. How's yours? By now half the boat has been chopped up into matchwood and the blades are getting closer.
INDY: This is your last chance.
KAZIM: No, Doctor Jones. It's yours! The wind of the blades is on their necks. INDY grabs KAZIM just in time and jumps. into the motorboat, driven by ELSA, which gets alongside in the nick of All right! Where's my father
INDY: All right! Where's my father
KAZIM: If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
INDY: Who are you?
KAZIM: My name is Kazim.
INDY: And why were you trying to kill The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years. And for all that time the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe. KAZIM pulls back his shirt to reveal a birthmark. or is it a tattoo? Whatever it is, it's a cruciform sword; a Christian cross which tapers down, like the blades of a broadsword.
KAZIM: The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years. And for all that time the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe. KAZIM pulls back his shirt to reveal a birthmark. or is it a tattoo? Whatever it is, it's a cruciform sword; a Christian cross which tapers down, like the blades of a broadsword.
KAZIM: Let me get off at this jetty. The boat is close to the edge of the canal. INDY gives ELSA a nod, telling her to bring the boat in. KAZIM steps ashore.
KAZIM: Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, or for yours?
INDY: I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
KAZIM: In that case, God be with you in your quest. Your father is being held in the Castle of Brunwald on the Austrian-German border. KAZIM walks away.
INDY: How's the head?
BRODY: It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta?" Hmmm. INDY, wearing a bathrobe, leans over to study the impression.
INDY: The Knights of the First Crusade laid siege to the city of Alexandretta for over a year. The entire city was destroyed. BRODY lowers the ice pack from his head and looks at INDY.
INDY: The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus you remember what the Grail Tablet said. "Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon." But where exactly?
BRODY: Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map. BRODY picks up the Grail Diary.
BRODY: He must have pieced it together from clues scattered through the whole history of the Grail Quest. A map with no names.
BRODY: Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.
INDY: ( solemnly ) Alexandretta. Now we know.
BRODY: Yes. Now we know.
INDY: ( rising ) Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun. INDY closes the Grail Diary and puts it into the pocket of his robe.
BRODY: What about you?
INDY: I'm going after Dad.
INDY: He goes in.
INDY: He steps into the room and knocks upon the bathroom door.
INDY: He opens the bathroom door, peering inside.
INDY: INT. ELSA'S BATHROOM - DAY Elsa is standing before a mirror, wearing a silk bathrobe. She gasps, startled, as INDY enters. He retreats back into her bedroom as she reaches up to turn off a record player sitting on a ledge above the bathtub.
ELSA: My room!
INDY: Mine, too.
ELSA: What were they looking for? She looks to INDY, who pulls the Grail Diary from his pocket.
INDY: The Grail Diary.
ELSA: The Grail Diary.
INDY: You had it? You didn't trust She looks hurt and beautiful. She comes closer to him.
ELSA: You had it? You didn't trust She looks hurt and beautiful. She comes closer to him.
INDY: I didn't know you. She's awfully hard to resist.
INDY: At least I let you tag along.
ELSA: Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
INDY: Knock it off. You're not mad.
ELSA: No. You like the way I do things.
INDY: No. You like the way I do things.
ELSA: It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice pier. She stomps her foot angrily. INDY flinches. She starts to walk away but Indy grabs her.
INDY: Look, what do you think is going on here? Since I've met you, I've nearly been incinerated, drowned, shot at, and chopped into fish bait. We're caught in the middle of something sinister here. My guess is Dad found out more than he was looking for. And until I'm sure, I'm going to continue to do things the way I think they should be done.
ELSA: How dare you kiss me! Now ELSA reaches for INDY and kisses him.
INDY: Leave me alone. I don't like fast women. But he embraces her, and ELSA begins to nibble at his ear.
ELSA: And I hate arrogant men. INDY smiles slyly as they fall to the bed.
INDY: Ahh, Venice. ELSA reaches up and pulls him back down to her.
INDY: What do you know about this I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
ELSA: I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
ELSA: What are you going to do?
INDY: Don't know. Think of something. He glances up to the beret ELSA is wearing. She reaches up and adjusts it.
BUTLER: INDY, followed by ELSA, steps inside, shaking the water from his overcoat. He adopts a Scottish accent.
INDY: And not before time! Did you intend to leave us standing on the doorstep all day? We're As INDY says this he pushes his way past the startled BUTLER, pulling a handkerchief from the man's pocket. ELSA follows, taking off her coat. INDY
INDY: Now look! I've gone and caught a sniffle. INDY dabs at his nose with the handkerchief as ELSA looks on in amused Are you expected?
BUTLER: ( coldly; with Are you expected?
INDY: Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
BUTLER: Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey How dare he?! Simultaneously knocking the BUTLER cold with one slug on the jaw. The Butler falls against a wall tapestry, sliding down to the floor, out cold.
INDY: Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey How dare he?! Simultaneously knocking the BUTLER cold with one slug on the jaw. The Butler falls against a wall tapestry, sliding down to the floor, out cold.

INDY: How dare he?! Simultaneously knocking the BUTLER cold with one slug on the jaw. The Butler falls against a wall tapestry, sliding down to the floor, out cold.
INDY: ( to ELSA; softly ) Nazis. I hate these guys. INDY and ELSA continue down the hallway. Indy carries a gun in his hand and his whip hangs from his belt. He steps to a closed door and listens.
INDY: This one. I think he's in here.
ELSA: How do you know? INDY points out an ELECTRICAL WIRE.
INDY: Because it's wired. He studies the situation for a moment, then decides to enter one of the other doors. He knocks at the doorthere is no response. He looks back at ELSA and INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY The room is dark and empty. INDY throws open the window shutters and looks out. RAIN comes down in sheets. There is a wide ledge beneath each window but below that is a SHEER DROP. Indy wants to get out onto the window ledge, which is several yards away.
ELSA: Indy? Indy? INDY reassures her.
INDY: Don't worry. this is kid's play. I'll be right back. He leans out the window and wraps his bullwhip around some wires that protrude from the castle wall above the next window. He gives the whip a forceful tug to make certain it will hold his weight.
HENRY: INDY gets to his feet.
INDY: ( a reflex ) Yes, sirl
HENRY: It is you Junior!
INDY: ( an old familiar Don't call me that, please.
HENRY: ( amazed ) But what are you doing here?
INDY: I came to get you! What do you NAZI VOICES ARE HEARD approaching. INDY and HENRY press themselves against the wall, Henry still holding the broken vase in his hand. INDY steps to the window and looks down. HENRY moves to a lamp, holding the vase under the light for a closer look.
HENRY: ( sotto, mumbled ) Late Fourteenth Century, Ming HENRY is all about the broken vase which he still holds in his hand. Father and son get onto crossed lines for a couple of moments.
HENRY: Oh, it breaks the heart.
INDY: ( quietly to himself ) And the head. ( to HENRY, aggrievedly ) You hit me, Dad!
HENRY: ( referring to the I'll never forgive myself
INDY: ( surprised, Don't worryI'm fine.
HENRY: Thank God!
HENRY: . it's fake. See, you can tell by the cross section. HENRY throws the vase against the wall where it SHATTERS.
INDY: No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.
HENRY: Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
INDY: Dad, they come in through the Good point. INDY steps to the door and stands, listening.
HENRY: ( laughs ) Good point. INDY steps to the door and stands, listening.
HENRY: But better safe than sorry. HENRY slides his umbrella through the straps of his bag.
HENRY: Humpfso I was wrong this time. But by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my Diary. You obviously got it.
INDY: I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
HENRY: ( excited ) Through the library?
INDY: I knew it. And the tomb of Sir CONTINUED: ( 3 ) INDY nods.
HENRY: I knew it. And the tomb of Sir CONTINUED: ( 3 ) INDY nods.
INDY: Found it.
HENRY: ( breathless ) He was actually there? You saw Well, what was left of him.
INDY: Well, what was left of him.
HENRY: ( trembling with And his shield. the inscription on Sir Richard's shield.?
INDY: ( beat ) It's a great moment in HENRY's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to INDY with joy.
HENRY: Alexandretta. of course. on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire. Oh, Junior. INDY winces, and would interrupt but suddenly it's not the moment.
HENRY: . you did it.
INDY: No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
HENRY: If only I could have been with There were rats, Dad.
INDY: There were rats, Dad.
HENRY: Yeah. big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
INDY: Yeah. big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
HENRY: They want my diary.
INDY: ( interested ) INDY's interest is a moment which becomes important later but for now it passes.
HENRY: I knew I had to get that book as far away from me as I possibly INDY's hand moves unconsciously to his pocket. His eyes turn inward.
INDY: ( thoughtfully ) Yeah. . . Then. BAMI The door is kicked open and three NAZIS enter. One is an S.S. OFFICER. The other two are SOLDIERS with machine guns. HENRY and INDY raise their hands.
S.S. OFFICER: Doctor Jones!!
S.S. OFFICER: I will take the book now.
S.S. OFFICER: ( to INDY ) You have the Diary in your pocket. HENRY laughs genuinely, believing himself to be laughing at the expense of the
HENRY: You doltl Do you think that my son would be that stupid that he would bring my Diary all the way back here? At which point an awful thought strikes HENRY.
HENRY: You didn't, did you? You didn't bring it, did you?
INDY: Well, uh.
HENRY: You did!!
INDY: Look, can we discuss this later?
HENRY: I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
INDY: ( overlapping ) Will you take it easy..!
HENRY: Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place? So it wouldn't fall into their I came here to save you.
INDY: I came here to save you.
HENRY: Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to save you, Junior?? INDY's eyes blazes His nostrils flares He's so pissed off, he literally RIPS A MACHINE GUN from the hands of one of the startled soldiers. and for a moment we think he's going to use it on his dad.
INDY: I told you He turns and sprays the room with machine gun fire, cutting all three NAZIS to ribbons and blowing them backwards across the room.
INDY: don't call me Junior! HENRY looks shocked and horrified.
HENRY: Look what you did!! Indy grabs him and pushes him ahead.
HENRY: ( aghast ) I can't believe what you just..
INDY: Elsa? Elsa? He opens a door and enters:
VOGEL: That's far enough Put down the gun, Doctor Jones. Put down the gun or the Fraulein dies.
HENRY: But she's one of them!
ELSA: Indy, please!
HENRY: She's a Nazi!
INDY: INDY is thrown. He doesn't know what to do. He looks at ELSA, then back to his father. Everyone is yelling at once:
HENRY: Trust me!
ELSA: Indy, no!
VOGEL: I will kill her!
HENRY: Oh yeah? Go ahead!
INDY: No! Don't Shoot!
HENRY: ( to Indy ) Don't worry. He won't.
ELSA: Indy, please! Do what he says!
HENRY: And don't listen to her!
VOGEL: Enough! She diesl VOGEL jams the barrel of the luger painfully into ELSA's neck. Elsa SCREAMS.
INDY: Wait! Waitl And then Indy gives in. He drops the machine gun to the table and it slides across, SHATTERING GLASS. HENRY GROANS audibly. VOGEL releases his grip on ELSA and shoves her toward INDY. She is propelled directly into his arms. He holds her tightly. She buries her face in his chest.
ELSA: I'm sorry. INDY comforts her.
INDY: No, don't be. Her hand slips into his coat pocket and removes the Grail Diary.
ELSA: But you should have listened to your father. She steps back next to VOGEL. INDY is stunned. HENRY gives him his most withering look of reprimand.
INDY: ( quietly to HENRY ) She ransacked her own room and I fell for it. How did you know she was a Nazi?
HENRY: How did you she was a Nazi?
INDY: How did you she was a Nazi?
HENRY: She talks in her sleep. INDY nods, and then the statement catches up with him. He looks at HENRY with surprise.
HENRY: I didn't trust her. Why did Because he didn't take my advice. The MAN IN THE CHAIR gets to his feet and turns, revealing himself to be. WALTER DONOVAN. INDY and HENRY react with stunned expressions.
INDY: Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody, Doctor Jones? DONOVAN smiles benignly and flips through the Grail Diary.
DONOVAN: Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody, Doctor Jones? DONOVAN smiles benignly and flips through the Grail Diary.
HENRY: I misjudged you WalterI knew you'd sell your mother for an Etruscan vase. But I didn't know you'd sell your country and your soul to the slime of humanity.
DONOVAN: ( suddenly erupting ) Doctor Schneider There're pages torn out of thisl ELSA rushes to DONOVAN's side. she takes the Grail Diary from him. Elsa takes a look for herselfthen glances up at Indy.
ELSA: This book contained a mapa map with no namesprecise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
INDY: So it did.
DONOVAN: Where are these missing pages? This maps we must have these pages backs HENRY gives INDY a look of surprise. Indy smirks.
ELSA: ( to Donovan ) You're wasting your breath. He won't tell us. And he doesn't have to. it's perfectly obvious where the pages are. ( looking at Indy ) . he's given them to Marcus HENRY now wears a pained expression.
HENRY: ( to Indy ) Marcus?! You didn't drag poor Marcus along, did you? He's not up to the challenge.
DONOVAN: He sticks out like a sore thumb. We'll find him.
INDY: The hell you will. He's got a two-day head-start on you, which is more than he needs. Brody's got friends in every town and village from here to the Sudan. He speaks a dozen languages, knows every local custom. He'll blend in. Disappear. You'll never see him again. With any luck, he's got the Grail already. HENRY looks amazed and impressed.
BRODY: Does anyone here speak English? Or even ancient Greek? A Man in the crowd holds out a cup of water to BRODY.
BRODY: No water, no thank you. No, fish make love in it. BRODY continues through the crowd past various STREET VENDORS. A Woman holds a chicken out to him.
BRODY: Thank you so much. No, I don't like that. No, I really don't want. No, no, thank you very much. No, thank you, madam. I'm a vegetarian. The Woman walks away, leaving BRODY alone in the crowd.
BRODY: Does anyone understand a word I'm saying here? SALLAH shoulders his way through the mob toward BRODY.
SALLAH: Mister Brodyl They meet and hug, then begin to walk.
BRODY: Oh, Sallahl What a relief!
SALLAH: ( laughs ) Marcus Brody, sir. And where is ( overlapping ) Oh, he's in Austria. A slight You are on your own? A Woman runs in and tugs on BRODY's coat. He waves her away.
BRODY: ( overlapping ) Oh, he's in Austria. A slight You are on your own? A Woman runs in and tugs on BRODY's coat. He waves her away.
SALLAH: You are on your own? A Woman runs in and tugs on BRODY's coat. He waves her away.
BRODY: Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you. . .have you arranged our supplies?
SALLAH: Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
BRODY: Oh, this map will show you. It was drawn by, uh. BRODY searches in his coat pocket for the map as a SINISTER MAN approaches.
SINISTER MAN: Mister Brody? BRODY puts the map back in his pocket. The SINISTER MAN clicks his heels and bows quickly.
SINISTER MAN: Welcome to Iskenderun. The Director of the Museum of Antiquities has sent a car for BRODY takes off his hat.
BRODY: Oh, what?. your servant, sir.
SALLAH: And I am his.
SINISTER MAN: Follow me, please. The man turns and joins a SECOND MAN. BRODY and SALLAH follow them.
BRODY: My reputation precedes me.
SALLAH: There is no museum in Iskenderun. The SECOND MAN overhears SALLAH. He and his companion turn quickly.
SECOND MAN: Papers please.
SALLAH: ( laughs ) Of course.
SALLAH: BRODY does not run. SALLAH pats his clothing, searching for his papers.
BRODY: Papers, sir. Got it here. SALLAH laughs and pulls out a newspaper.
SALLAH: Papers, sir. Got it here. SALLAH laughs and pulls out a newspaper.
SALLAH: Just finished reading it myself. BRODY looks confused. SALLAH shows the newspaper to the SECOND MAN.
BRODY: Egyptian Mail. Morning edition. Did you say.? Uh, uh. SALLAH puts the newspaper in front of the SECOND MAN's face, then punches him through the newspaper.
SALLAH: Egyptian Mail. Morning edition. Did you say.? Uh, uh. SALLAH puts the newspaper in front of the SECOND MAN's face, then punches him through the newspaper.
BRODY: Did you say.? Uh, uh. SALLAH puts the newspaper in front of the SECOND MAN's face, then punches him through the newspaper.
SALLAH: The SECOND MAN falls, knocking over a vendor's stand. SALLAH and BRODY begin to run. SALLAH knocks the FIRST MAN into another vendor's stand. The STAND COLLAPSES on impact. SALLAH grabs BRODY and pulls him through the crowded streets.
SALLAH: ( to Brody; pointing ) Okay, okay, quick, quick, quickl Hide in that doorl Hide in that SALLAH points to a DARKENED DOORWAY, hung with a curtain, at the top of a ramp. BRODY runs up the ramp, throws back the curtain and disappears into the darkness.
HENRY: Doctor Schneider. Message from Berlin. You must return immediately: a rally at the Institute of Aryan Your presence on the platform is requested. at the highest level.
VOGEL: Doctor Schneider. Message from Berlin. You must return immediately: a rally at the Institute of Aryan Your presence on the platform is requested. at the highest level.
ELSA: Your presence on the platform is requested. at the highest level.
VOGEL: Your presence on the platform is requested. at the highest level.
ELSA: Thank you, Herr Oberst. I will meet you at Iskenderun.
DONOVAN: Take this Diary to the Reich Museum in Berlin. It will show them our progress, ahead of schedule. Without a map, I'm afraid it's no better than a He hands her the Grail Diary.
VOGEL: ( to DONOVAN, meaning Let me kill them now.
ELSA: No. If we fail to recover the pages from Brody, we'll need them Always do what the doctor orders. DONOVAN leads VOGEL out. The NAZI GUARDS follow. Once they are gone, ELSA turns to INDY.
DONOVAN: ( to VOGEL, with a Always do what the doctor orders. DONOVAN leads VOGEL out. The NAZI GUARDS follow. Once they are gone, ELSA turns to INDY.
ELSA: Don't look at me like thatwe both wanted the Grail, I would have done anything to get it. You would have done the same. INDY shakes his head "no."
INDY: I'm sorry you think so. She runs her hand down the side of his face. INDY pulls away. INDY and HENRY are still tied back-to-back of course. ELSA bends to speak quietly into INDY's ear. which is near enough to Henry's ear.
ELSA: ( whispers ) I can't forget. how wonderful it was.
HENRY: Thank you. It was rather wonderful. She smiles and kisses INDY passionately. HENRY glances back and looks rather VOGEL appears to remind ELSA of her appointment.
VOGEL: Doctor Schneider! Your car is That's how Austrians say goodbye. ELSA exits. VOGEL stays behind for another moment.
ELSA: ( to INDY, after That's how Austrians say goodbye. ELSA exits. VOGEL stays behind for another moment.
VOGEL: And this is how we say goodbye in Germany, Doctor Jones. VOGEL punches INDY in the jaw. A hard and vicious jab that snaps Indy's head Ohh. . . VOGEL exits. INDY shakes his head clear.
HENRY: Ohh. . . VOGEL exits. INDY shakes his head clear.
INDY: ( to himself ) Ooooh. I like the Austrian way So did I.
HENRY: So did I.
INDY: Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do!
HENRY: ( confused ) You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
INDY: Are you kidding?I made that up! You know Marcushe got lost once in his own museum! Indy and Henry are pulling at the ropes with great urgency.
INDY: Can you try and reach into my left jacket pocket? HENRY is able to wiggle his hand towards Indy's coat pocket. INDY squirms his body around towards Henry's hand.
HENRY: What am I looking for?
INDY: My lucky charm.
HENRY: Feels like a cigarette lighter.
INDY: Try and burn through the ropes. HENRY's fingers open the lighter and ignite the flame.
HENRY: Very good. HENRY yelps as the cigarette lighter burns his hand. He drops the lighter to the floor. Henry kicks at the lighter, trying to reach it, but cannot. The rug starts to burn. INDY doesn't know it yet.
HENRY: I ought to tell you something.
INDY: Don't get sentimental now Dad save it 'til we get out of here.
HENRY: The floor's on fire! See?!
INDY: ( turns and sees ) And the chair.
HENRY: And the chair.
INDY: All right, movel Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do. They begin to rock their chair legs, inching their way off the burning carpet.
LIEUTENANT: Etwas wichtig, mein Herr. DONOVAN puts on his glasses to read the message.
DONOVAN: Well, we have Marcus Brody. But more important, we have the map. A RADIO OPERATOR steps forward with yet another written message for
RADIO OPERATOR: Aus Berlin, mein Herr.
DONOVAN: ( reading ) "By the personal command of the Fuhrer. Secrecy essential to success. Eliminate the American ( to VOGEL ) Germany has declared war on the Jones boys. ( to DRIVER ) Los fahren. The car drives off.
INDY: Finally they turn their heads in the same direction.
HENRY: Finally they turn their heads in the same direction.
INDY: Finally they turn their heads in the same direction.
HENRY: Finally they turn their heads in the same direction.
INDY: Finally they turn their heads in the same direction.
HENRY: Head for the fireplace!
INDY: Head for the fireplace!
HENRY: BANGING, ROCKING and HOPPING their chairs, they work their way INTO THE FIREPLACEthe only safe place from the now ROARING FIRE.
INDY: I think I can get these ropes Indy struggles to free his hands. His foot kicks out and accidentally hits a metal grill that operates a Secret Door.
INDY: The fireplace floor rotates like a Lazy Susan and Indy and his father find themselves in the:
HENRY: Our situation has not improved. INDY glances over his shoulder at HENRY.
INDY: Listen Dad. I'm almost free. INDY's foot hits the grill again. and the fireplace rotates to:
WOMAN: Now the RADIOMEN turn to see HENRY and INDY.
WOMAN: TWO NAZIS draw their revolvers and FIRE SEVERAL SHOTS at INDY and HENRY
HENRY: This is intolerable!
INDY: I'm out, Dad! INDY finally breaks free. And he immediately begins to untie his father.
HENRY: Well done, boy!
INDY: Come on Dad.
INDY: Dead end. HENRY looks horrified by what he's been forced to do as INDY searches frantically for an exit.
INDY: There's got to be a. a secret door around. A passageway or INDY begins to run his hands over the wallsfrantic.
HENRY: I find that if I just sit down and think. HENRY sits on a chair which tips back, hitting the wall behind it. The floor at INDY's feet suddenly begins DROPPING AWAYI INDY grabs a railing to keep from falling, but loses his grip and plunges through the opening which has formed a SPIRAL STAIRCASE. He rolls down the stairs.
INDY: . the solution presents itself.
HENRY: . the solution presents itself.
INDY: Great. More boats.
HENRY: Would you say this has been just another typical day for you? Huh? HENRY tosses his case at INDY who catches it and angrily throws it back to his Ooofl No! It's been better than INDY moves back to the dock and pushes the boat away. HENRY looks confused.
INDY: ( ironically ) Ooofl No! It's been better than INDY moves back to the dock and pushes the boat away. HENRY looks confused.
INDY: Come on, Dad. Come onl
HENRY: What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
VOGEL: Sie alle ins Boat. Schnell! CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL a large box which suddenly BREAKS APART as INDY, now on a motorbike with HENRY in the sidecar, ROARS PAST THE DOCK, hitting TWO NAZI SOLDIERS who scream as they fall into the river. VOGEL screams after INDY and HENRY as they drive off.
INDY: FOUR NAZI SOLDIERS ON MOTORCYCLES They chase down the road after INDY and HENRY. INDY turns the motorbike down a smaller, dusty tree-lined road. HENRY gasps as he is jostled about in the sidecar. One of the NAZI SOLDIERS gives chase along a higher road running in the same direction.
GUARD: Halt! Halt! THE NAZI SOLDIER rides his motorcycle through the other side of the barrier
HENRY: Stop! Stop! The motorbike skids to a stop.
INDY: Stop! Stop! The motorbike skids to a stop.
HENRY: Stop! Stop! The motorbike skids to a stop.
HENRY: You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
INDY: ( pointing towards Brody's this way.
HENRY: My Diary's in Berlin.
INDY: You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
HENRY: There is more in the Diary than just the map.
INDY: All right Dadtell me.
HENRY: Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
INDY: What final challenge?
HENRY: Three devices of such lethal Booby traps?
INDY: Booby traps?
HENRY: Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.
INDY: But what are they? Can't you I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember
HENRY: I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember
INDY: Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
HENRY: Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
INDY: What about Marcus?
HENRY: Marcus would agree with me.
INDY: Two selfless martyrs. Jesus HENRY slaps him across the face. INDY is rocked to his foundations, not by any means entirely by the blow itself.
HENRY: That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me?
INDY: This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.
HENRY: Oh yes, she did. Only too well. Unfortunately she kept her illness from me until all I could do was mourn her.
HENRY: My boy, we are Pilgrims in an unholy land. Then. Indy sees something that makes him stop in his tracks. WE PAN ALONG HIS LINE OF SIGHT to:
THE PODIUM: where high-ranking Officers of the Third Reich stand flanking ADOLF HITLER as they oversee the rally.
ANOTHER ANGLE: ELSA is walking away in an open area, background of torches, vehicles, Nazi Officers. one of whom is now none other than INDY, coming up to her before she knows he is there. His voice is quiet and tough, his eyes hard.
INDY: Fraulein Doctor. Where is it? Still startled, her reaction makes it clear that Indy is even now a lover in her How did you get here?
ELSA: How did you get here?
INDY: Where is it? I want it. INDY pushes ELSA against a column and begins to search her clothing for the Diary. He pulls the book from Elsa's pocket.
ELSA: You came back for the book? My father didn't want it She understands him. It's as though he slapped her.
INDY: My father didn't want it She understands him. It's as though he slapped her.
ELSA: Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail, not the Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands forwho gives a damn what you think?
INDY: ( vicious ) Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands forwho gives a damn what you think?
ELSA: ( hard and fast ) You do. Now it's as though she'd slapped him back. His hands fly to her neck.
INDY: All I have to do is squeeze.
ELSA: All I have to do is scream. It's a standoff emotionally. He knows he'd never do it. she knows it too. And the same goes for screaming. INDY releases her and backs away. she looks at him with a lover's pain. He moves over to HENRY.
INDY: I've got it. Let's get the hell out of here. They move off and almost run headlong into HITLER and his entire entourage coming down from the Podium. 50 kids push their autograph books for Hitler's HITLER pauses to sign them. Hitler looks Indy's way. They make eye contact. It only lasts a moment but the moment is electric. HITLER breaks the spell by taking the Grail Diary from him, opens it to the first page and signs his autograph. He hands it back and moves on.
HENRY: What did you get?
INDY: I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
HENRY: INDY and HENRY show their papers to the Boarding Guards, then join the line of passengers, which has already begun to move toward a:
MOORED ZEPPELIN: Ten stories tall and longer than two football fields: Flying in the grand tradition!
INDY: Well, we made it. HENRY looks over his newspaper at INDY.
HENRY: When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then I'll share that But INDY looks out the window and is suddenly concerned when he sees:
INDY: But INDY looks out the window and is suddenly concerned when he sees:
VOGEL: Nicht zumachen! Wir steigen ein!
INDY: sits back in his chair, looks to HENRY, now reading his newspaper. A STEWARD enters and sets a bowl of nuts on the table in front of INDY and HENRY, then continues down the aisle of passengers. Indy follows after the Steward. He puts his arm around the Steward's shoulder and together they walk up a flight of stairs.
VOGEL: now walks up the aisle. He approaches a MALE PASSENGER hidden behind a newspaper. VOGEL uses his walking stick to lower the newspaper and show the Passenger the leaflet with Henry's photograph.
VOGEL: Haben sie disen Mann gesehen? The Passengers at the table shake their heads in the negative. VOGEL shows the picture to other Passengers.
FEMALE PASSENGER: INDY ( O.S. ) Fahrscheine, bitte.
MALE PASSENGER: VOGEL turns to see:
INDY: WEARING THE HAT AND JACKET OF THE CHIEF STEWARD.
INDY: Tickets please. The Passengers do not react to the request, made in English.
INDY: Fahrscheine meine Dame. Bitte.
VOGEL: approaches HENRY, still hidden behind his newspaper. Again, VOGEL uses his walking stick to lower the paper, revealing Henry's face.
VOGEL: Guten Tag, Herr Jones. Now INDY, still playing the role of Steward, asks VOGEL for his ticket.
INDY: Fahrscheine meine Herr.
VOGEL: Tickets please. HENRY looks confused.
INDY: Tickets please. HENRY looks confused.
VOGEL: ( in German ) VOGEL glances up and recognizes INDYwho quickly punches Vogel in the face, knocking him toward the window. In another quick move, Indy TOSSES HIM OUT THE WINDOW onto the tarmac below. Shocked Passengers blink in bewilderment.
INDY: ( in German; with a No ticket. Everyone else with a ticket quickly produces it and waves it in Indy's face.
VOGEL: Du wirst nochmal boren von mir!
HENRY: You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.
INDY: ( meaning ELSA ) That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa-er, her grandfather!
HENRY: Well, I'm as human as the next I was the next man.
INDY: I was the next man.
HENRY: ( laughs ) Ships that pass in the night. HENRY opens his Diary and begins to thumb through it.
INDY: Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk Hmmm. What did we talk about?
HENRY: Hmmm. What did we talk about?
INDY: We didn't talk. We never talked.
HENRY: And do I detect a rebuke?
INDY: A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
HENRY: Actually, I was a wonderful father.
INDY: HENRY looks up from his Diary.
HENRY: Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self- CONTINUED: ( 2 ) What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.
INDY: What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.
HENRY: You left just when you were becoming interesting.
INDY: Dad, how can you ?
HENRY: ( interrupting ) Very well. I'm here now. He closes the Diary and leans back in his seat.
HENRY: What do you want to talk about? INDY stutters uncomfortably as HENRY stares at him, waiting for a response.
INDY: ( laughs ) Well. I can't think of anything.
HENRY: Then what are you complaining Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges. "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth. "
INDY: What does that mean?
HENRY: ( laughs ) I don't know. We'll find out.
INDY: They're turning around. They're taking us back to Germany.
INDY: Well, I thought it would take them a lot longer to figure out the radio was dead. Come on, Dad. Move! Then INDY opens the doors. We see plenty of blue sky and white clouds. We also see a small BIPLANE that is suspended from the Zeppelin by a HOOK & CRANE
INDY: Come on, Dad. Come on!
HENRY: ( with delight ) I didn't know you could fly a Flyyes. Landno.
INDY: Flyyes. Landno.
INDY: Dad, you're gonna have to use the machine gun. Get it ready. HENRY turns and grips the MOUNTED MACHINE GUN with a perplexed Eleven o'clock! HENRY pulls out his watch.
INDY: ( turning; pointing ) Eleven o'clock! HENRY pulls out his watch.
INDY: Dadeleven o'clock!!
HENRY: What happens at eleven o'clock? INDY uses his arm to demonstrate that he's referring to a direction and not a Twelveeleventen. Eleven o'clock. Fire! HENRY doesand the EXPLODING GUN nearly shakes him out of his seat. Indy's slow speed and small size works to his advantage. The speeding Messerschmidts continually overshoot him, WHIZZING past in a blurmaking wide turns miles away in the sky. HENRY has one of the Messerschmidts in his sight. He pulls back on the trigger
INDY: ( frustrated ) Twelveeleventen. Eleven o'clock. Fire! HENRY doesand the EXPLODING GUN nearly shakes him out of his seat. Indy's slow speed and small size works to his advantage. The speeding Messerschmidts continually overshoot him, WHIZZING past in a blurmaking wide turns miles away in the sky. HENRY has one of the Messerschmidts in his sight. He pulls back on the trigger
INDY: Dad, are we hit?!
HENRY: More or less.
HENRY: Son, I'm sorry. They got us. INDY looks back at the missing tail section, then at his father. The plane begins to go down. INDY struggles to control its descent.
INDY: Hang on, Dads We're going in! HENRY slumps down fearfully in his seat.
HENRY: ( sarcastic ) Nice landing.
INDY: Suddenly, INDY's attention is directed to:
HENRY: Those people are trying to kill I know, Dadl
INDY: I know, Dadl
HENRY: It's a new experience for me.
INDY: It happens to me all the time.
THE MAN: turns to the wheel, the hubcap in his hands. Suddenly the wheel moves forward, startling the Old Man.
HENRY: This is intolerable!
INDY: This could be close.
HENRY: Faster, boy faster!
HENRY: Well, they don't come any closer than that! HENRY looks out the windshield and sees the second Messerschmidt SCREAMING out of the sky toward them.
THE CAR: FALLS INTO THE HOLE made by the bomb.
INDY: Dad, he's coming back. INDY and HENRY run down the mountainside to:
THE MESSERSCHMIDT: swings around and is coming in for another pass.
INDY: Bullets kick up sand leading up to him. then THE MESSERSCHMIDT AND THE SEA GULLS meet in midair. MASSACRE! Sea gulls are shredded by the Messerschmidt's whirling propeller blades into a FEATHERY WHITE PUREE that SPLATTERS against the cockpit and CLOGS THE
HENRY: I suddenly remembered Charlemagne. "Let my armies be the rocks and the trees and the birds in the sky." INDY wears a proud expression as he watches HENRY walk down the beach.
DONOVAN: These pages are taken from Professor Jones' diary, Your Highness. And they include a map that pinpoints the exact location of the Grail. DONOVAN and the SULTAN walk together through an archway.
DONOVAN: As you can see, the Grail is all but in our hands. However, Your Highness, we would not think of crossing your soil without your permission, nor of removing the Grail from your borders without suitable What have you brought?
SULTAN: What have you brought?
VOGEL: Bring den Schatzl TWO NAZI SOLDIERS bring forward a HUGE STEAMER TRUNK. They open the lid and begin to empty it of its contents: Gold and silver objects of every description.
DONOVAN: Precious valuables, Your Highness, "donated" by some of the finest families in all of Germany. The SULTAN gets up from his chair and walks toward the trunk. He goes right past it and begins to inspect the Nazi staff car parked nearby.
SULTAN: Rolls-Royce Phantom Two. 4.3 litre, 30 horsepower, six cylinder engine, with Stromberg Downdraft The SULTAN points to the engine under the hood.
SULTAN: Can go from zero to 100 kilometres an hour in 12.5 seconds. And I even like the color.
DONOVAN: ( after a beat ) The keys are in the ignition, Your Highness.
SULTAN: You shall have camels, horses, an armed escort, provisions, desert vehiclesand tanksl
DONOVAN: You're welcome. Somebody else is also taking note.and we see that it is KAZIM, the spy at the ELSA is revealed coming down the stairs toward DONOVAN and VOGEL.
ELSA: We have no time to lose. Indiana Jones and his father have escaped.
SALLAH: We go this way. SALLAH waves his arms and shouts to a CAMEL HERDER.
SALLAH: Get that camel out of the way!
INDY: What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
SALLAH: ( overlapping ) Ah, they set out across the desert this afternoon. I believe they took Mister Brody with them. HENRY removes his hat and hits INDY with it.
HENRY: Now they have the map! And in this sort of race, there's no silver medal for finishing second.
DONOVAN: Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?
BRODY: I'd rather spit in your face. But as I haven't got any spit. VOGEL snatches the canteen away from BRODY before he can drink.
VOGEL: We must be within three or four miles. Otherwise we are off the He hands the map to ELSA, drinks from the canteen, and hands that back to
DONOVAN: Well, Marcus, we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind.
BRODY: You're meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend. HENRY and SALLAH are at INDY's side as he views Donovan's party in the distance. Parked nearby is a CAR containing all of their supplies.
INDY: Ah, I see Brody. He seems okay. They've got a tank. Six-pound Then Donovan notices a reflection from the hills. What he sees is:
HENRY: What do you think you're doing?! Get down!
INDY: Dad, we're well out of range. At that moment the tank FIRES A SHELL in their direction. It WHISTLES overhead and BLOWS UP THE PARKED CAR. INDY, HENRY and SALLAH cover their heads as automobile fragments rain down upon them.
SALLAH: That car belonged to my brother- Come oncome on!
INDY: ( gesturing to the Come oncome on!
VOGEL: I can't see anyone up there.
DONOVAN: Maybe it wasn't even Jones.
ELSA: No. It's him all right. He's here somewhere.
DONOVAN: ( to VOGEL ) Put Brody in the tank. KAZIM peers over a rock, pointing his rifle at the group below.
DONOVAN: ( to ELSA ) Well, in this sun, without transportation, they're as good as dead. BULLETS EXPLODE off the vehicles and cliff. DONOVAN and ELSA duck. A NAZI SOLDIER falls from the tank as BULLETS EXPLODE around him. KAZIM'S MEN, BRETHREN OF THE CRUCIFORM SWORD, continue to FIRE. ELSA and DONOVAN take cover beside the parked car.
DONOVAN: It's Jones, all right.
HENRY: Now, who are all these people?
INDY: Who cares? As long as they're keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I organize some transportation. CUT BACK to the action. The BRETHREN are firing at the DONOVAN party and are being fired on by the Donovan party. TWO NAZI SOLDIERS throw HAND GRENADES into the cliffs. They EXPLODE, killing one of Kazim's Brethren. The battle continuesa fierce exchange of GUNSHOTS, GRENADES and MACHINE GUN FIRE with losses on both sides.
INDY: I'm going after those horses.
SALLAH: I'll take the camels.
INDY: I don't need camels.
SALLAH: But, Indy
INDY: No camels!
DONOVAN: ( re KAZIM ) Who is he?
KAZIM: A messenger from God. For the unrighteous, the Cup of Life holds everlasting damnation. KAZIM dies.
INDY: leaps atop a TURKISH SOLDIER on horseback, pulling the man and the horse to the ground. A SECOND TURK comes to assist his comrade; INDY mounts the horse, knocking both Turks to the ground.
HENRY: Arghhh! Oh!
BRODY: Arghhh! Oh!
HENRY: "Genius of the Restoration" Now BRODY tugs his ears, flaps his arms and touches his head.
BRODY: "aid our own resuscitation!" They exchange a handshake.
BRODY: Henryl What are you doing here?!
HENRY: It's a rescue, old boys Come on. As HENRY starts to climb out of the tank, TWO NAZI SOLDIERS DROP DOWN from above, their Lugers drawn. They are followed by VOGEL.
VOGEL: ( re HENRY ) Search him. The NAZI SOLDIERS point their guns at HENRY and BRODY.
VOGEL: ( to HENRY ) What is in this book? That miserable little Diary of yours! VOGEL removes a glove and slaps HENRY with it.
VOGEL: Here's the map. The book is useless, and yet you come all the way back to Berlin to get it. He slaps HENRY again.
VOGEL: What are you hiding? Another slap.
VOGEL: What does the Diary tell you that it doesn't tell us?! VOGEL reaches out to slap HENRY yet again, but Henry grabs his arm, stopping CONTINUED: ( 2 ) It tells me that goose-stepping morons like yourself should try reading books instead of burning DONOVAN appears at the turret cover.
HENRY: It tells me that goose-stepping morons like yourself should try reading books instead of burning DONOVAN appears at the turret cover.
DONOVAN: Colonel? Jones is getting away.
VOGEL: ( indicating HENRY ) I think not, Herr Donovan.
DONOVAN: Not that Jonesthe other Jones!
NAZI SOLDIER: Herr Colonel!
INDY: Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?
SALLAH: Compensation for my brother-in- law's car. Indy, your father and Where's my father?
INDY: Where's my father?
SALLAH: They have them. In the belly of that steel beast. INDY and SALLAH charge forward leading their horses and camels. Then VOGEL commands the Tank Driver to give chase.
VOGEL: EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY The tank starts firing at INDY on horseback. Indy zigs and zags as the tank fires two rounds at Indy, barely missing him. Each time Indy emerges from the plume of desert dust, hanging like a toadstool in the air.
VOGEL: Der Kubelwagon sprengen! The Gunner puts a shell into the large gun. He FIRES, CATAPULTING THE KUBELWAGON into the air, where it EXPLODES. The tank drives through the resulting smoke an dust, then rolls over the Kubelwagon, crushing it
NAZI SOLDIER: Keine Bewegung. He points his gun at HENRY and BRODY.
NAZI SOLDIER: Keine Bewegung. The smaller gun, blocked by the rocks, BACKFIRES, blowing the breech out into the face of the gunner, killing him and filling the tank with smoke. BRODY, HENRY, VOGEL and the driver begin to choke.
INDY: Dad! Dad! Dad!
HENRY: Junior? Junior? Junior! The NAZI SOLDIER swings his fist, knocking HENRY off his seat.
SIDE ANGLE: One of the two troop carriers is paralleling the tank and like pirates boarding a galleon, Nazi Soldiers leap over the treads and are swarming all over INDY. INDY is struggling with a German's Luger. INDY presses the luger against his assailant and forces the Nazi to squeeze off a shot into himself. The bullet not only passes through the Nazi, but passes through two other Nazis standing directly behind him on the crowded tank top and three bodies fall away, leaving Indy to stare at the gun in disbelief.
INDY: He drops the gun down into the tank.
INDY: Dad! Dadl Get it! VOGEL pulls INDY from the tank entrance, yanking on the chain wrapped around his neck.
PERISCOPE SOLDIER: ( laughing ) Diese Amerikane. Sie Kampfen wie EXT. TANK - DAY INDY now lies on top of VOGEL. He kicks out at the periscope which spins INT. TANK - DAY The periscope handle spins around and hits the PERISCOPE SOLDIER in the head. He falls against the NAZI SOLDIER guarding HENRY and BRODY. HENRY pushes the NAZI SOLDIER aside and grabs the gun. The PERISCOPE SOLDIER struggles to take the gun from Henry.
BRODY: Henry, the pen
HENRY: But don't you see? The pen is mightier than the sword.
BRODY: But don't you see? The pen is mightier than the sword.
BRODY: Look what you didl
HENRY: It's war.
HENRY: Didn't I tell you it was a rescue, A NAZI SOLDIER appears and pulls HENRY down. VOGEL raises the shovel above his head and brings it crashing down on INDY, still hanging from the protruding gun. INDY loses his grip and now hangs from the gun suspended only by the strap of his leather pouch. He screams as the gun scrapes against the cliff wall, sending stones tumbling down over him.
INDY: You call this archaeology?
HENRY: You call this archaeology?
INDY: Get out of there, Dad! INDY pulls HENRY and BRODY from the tank. VOGEL pulls himself back atop the tank armed again with the shovel which he swings at Indy, who ducks and grabs Vogel's arm.
BRODY: How does one get off this thing? As INDY winds up to punch VOGEL he catches BRODY in the face on the backswing, then completes the movement and knocks Vogel down.
HENRY: ( to INDY ) Where's Marcus?! Before INDY can answer, VOGEL is up and swinging with the shovel. Indy ducks but the shovel catches HENRY sending him over the side and onto the moving INDY grabs his whip, knocking VOGEL aside. As HENRY speeds toward the front of the tank to certain doom, INDY, with lightning speed, whips out his bullwhip, wrapping the end of the whip around Henry's right ankle.
INDY: HENRY is bouncing across the treads like a rag-doll. INDY struggles to hold onto the end of the bullwhip.
INDY: Hang on, Dad! SALLAH draws his horse next to the treads. He tips his fez to HENEY.
SALLAH: Father of Indygive me your VOGEL now punches INDY in the back and grabs him around the neck. Still, INDY refuses to let go of the whip.
INDY: Sallah! Get Dadl SALLAH reaches out to HENRY.
SALLAH: Give me your hand! SALLAH manages to hold onto HENRY as he brings his horse to a stop just at the cliff's edge. INDY finally frees himself of VOGEL's grasp, twisting his arm painfully away from Indy's neck, then landing a hard blow to Vogel's head.
INDY: looks down at the fast-approaching cliff, his face filled with horror. We SEE his HAT BLOW OFF and sail over the cliff's edge.
VOGEL: He sees his life passing before him, he screams at the top of his lungs!
LONG SHOT: The tank trundles over the cliff and PLUMMETS TO THE BOTTOM.
HENRY: We HEAR the TANK EXPLODING.
SALLAH: Oh, God. I've lost him. And I never told him anything. I just wasn't ready, Marcus. Five minutes would have been enough. And then. looking dazed and bewildered, INDY STAGGERS UP BEHIND THEM. He joins the others at the edge of the cliff, looking down at the wreckage below with a bewildered expression. Finally, Henry becomes aware of his presence. HENRY says nothing. He just looks at Indy, overcome with emotion. Finally, he throws his arms around him.
HENRY: Oh, God. I've lost him. And I never told him anything. I just wasn't ready, Marcus. Five minutes would have been enough. And then. looking dazed and bewildered, INDY STAGGERS UP BEHIND THEM. He joins the others at the edge of the cliff, looking down at the wreckage below with a bewildered expression. Finally, Henry becomes aware of his presence. HENRY says nothing. He just looks at Indy, overcome with emotion. Finally, he throws his arms around him.
HENRY: I thought I'd lost you, boy. After a moment, Indy's head clears. And he becomes aware of his father's embrace. Something he hasn't felt in a long timeif ever. And it touches him. He hugs his father back.
INDY: I thought you had too, sir. BRODY and SALLAH are moved by this sudden reconciliation.
HENRY: Wellwell done! Come on! HENRY pats INDY on the back and Indy collapses, sitting hard on the rocky cliff Unaware, HENRY, SALLAH and BRODY start to walk away. Henry turns back to see INDY still sitting on the ground.
HENRY: Let's go then. why are you sitting there resting when we're so near the end? Come on let's go! HENRY turns and walks toward the horse with BRODY and SALLAH. Suddenly the FEDORA, borne on the wind, BLOWS INTO SCENE and lands at INDY's feet.
DONOVAN: The Canyon of the Crescent Moon. Now ELSA peers through the binoculars.
THE TURK: is about to approach the spot where a TURKISH SOLDIER LIES DEAD. We don't notice it right away, but the dead soldier has been DECAPITATED. THE TURK stopsonly one step away from the beheaded soldier.
THE TURK: takes one more stepa fatal step, it turns out. We hear a ROARA WHOOSH of airbut we SEE NOTHINGexcept THE TURK'S HEAD FLY OFF AND BOUNCE across the ground.
DONOVAN: Helmut, another volunteer! TWO NAZI SOLDIERS force another Turk forward. Suddenly. The SOUND OF RIFLE BOLTS being cocked. Everyone turns to discover INDY and his party surrounded by NAZI SOLDIERS. Indy's group are relieved of their guns.
ELSA: ( to INDY ) I never expected to see you again.
INDY: I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up.
DONOVAN: Step back now, Doctor Schneider. Give Doctor Jones some room. He's going to recover the Grail for us.
DONOVAN: Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
INDY: As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
DONOVAN: ( scornfully ) Nazis?!Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the ( he draws his pistol ) The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.
INDY: Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
DONOVAN: You know something, Doctor Jones?. you're absolutely right. Then DONOVAN shifts his aim, just a bit, and SHOOTS HENRY. The bullet enters his side below the ribs.
INDY: Junior. . .
HENRY: Junior. . .
ELSA: ( to ELSA ) Get back! HENRY collapses. Blood flowing from the wound. BRODY and SALLAH rush to his assistance.
DONOVAN: ( to ELSA ) Get back! HENRY collapses. Blood flowing from the wound. BRODY and SALLAH rush to his assistance.
DONOVAN: You can't save him when you're INDY hesitates.
DONOVAN: The healing power of the Grail is the only thing that can save your father now. It's time to ask yourself what you believe. INDY takes in the situation. The two decapitated men lie a few yards in front of him. He walks to the entranceway, flanked by two stone lions. We get silent reaction shotsELSASALLAHBRODYDONOVANregistering their different emotions INDY proceeds forward. His hands open the Grail Diary.
INDY: "The Breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass. . . " INDY takes a few steps forward.
INDY: "The penitent man will pass. The penitent man." INDY stops. He is about to reach the spot where two men have just died. HENRY looks at INDY. Indy looks at Henry.
HENRY: ( in a raspy voice ) "Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass."
INDY: ( quietly to himself ) The penitent man will pass. The penitent. the penitent. The penitent man.
HENRY: The penitent man. The penitent. INDY takes a step forward through the cobwebs.
INDY: The penitent man is humble before Penitent. Penitent.
HENRY: Penitent. Penitent.
INDY: The penitent man is humble. The cobwebs begin to move..
INDY: He kneels before God. We hear the awful rush of airWHOOSH! Because INDY is in the act of kneeling, only his hat is knocked off and his hair flies in his face. Instinctively he ROLLS FORWARD on the ground out of harm's way and looks up. From his new position he is able to see what is causing all the trouble: A RAZOR
INDY: I'm through!
DONOVAN: We're through! BRODY and SALLAH smile, relieved.
SALLAH: ( to HENRY ) He's all right. HENRY shakes his head.
HENRY: BACK TO INDY holding the Grail Diary, reading once again, his fedora now covered in cobwebs.
INDY: "The second challenge is the footsteps of God will he proceed." The Word of God. The Word of. INDY pulls away some cobwebs to reveal a cobblestone path. Each cobble is engraved with a letter.
INDY: "Proceed in the footsteps of the lifts his head painfully.
HENRY: lifts his head painfully.
HENRY: The Word of God.
BRODY: No, Henry. Try not to talk.
HENRY: The Name of God.
INDY: The Name of God. Jehovahl
HENRY: still lies in SALLAH's arms. BRODY leans over him.
HENRY: But in the Latin alphabet, "Jehovah" begins with an "I."
INDY: INDY takes a step and immediately a stone breaks away and INDY falls up to his hip his leg stuck through the hold where the stone once was.
"J.": INDY takes a step and immediately a stone breaks away and INDY falls up to his hip his leg stuck through the hold where the stone once was.
HENRY: Oh dear!
HENRY: Oh dear!
INDY: In Latin, "Jehovah" starts with an "I." "I". Now we SEE each letter on the stones as INDY carefully walks forward. DONOVAN and ELSA follow in his footsteps.
INDY: "E". "H". "O". "V". "A". INDY sighs with relief and steps forward to:
INDY: "The path of flood. Only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth." INDY looks around and then he notices that inscribed into the rock above his head is the head of a lion.
INDY: Impossiblel Nobody can jump this! INDY looks down into the Diary and tortures over what it is asking him to do.
BRODY: rushes forward and calls to INDY.
BRODY: Indy. Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!
INDY: ( realizing ) It's. a leap of faith. Oh, calls to his son.
HENRY: calls to his son.
HENRY: You must believe, boy. you must. We see him do it. We see him leap into space. We see that he is in midair. We see that he is not going to make it. His hands claw for the opposite wall but he is going to fall 100 feet to his death. And thenhe doesn't! He appears to be held up by thin air as he lands on his hands and knees. INDY looks around and down and now he figures it out. Ingeniously, the First Crusaders have painted a pathway to align with the rocks 100 feet below. It is a perfect forced perspective image of the rocks below with lines from a hundred feet continuing six feet below his sight line where his feet are stepping. It's painted to blend in with the rocks below. Highly evolved camouflage. in perfect alignment with everything we see below. When INDY leans out to the left or right. that's when he sees the perfect alignment shift that betrays the trick. Indy throws some dirt on the bridge and he crosses it like the first Crusader from the painting over Henry's desk. Indy crawls through a small opening in the side of the cliff and enters a Temple. A vast array of chalices is displayed on the altar of this small Temple. Perhaps a hundred or more. Many sizes, many shapes, some gold, some silver, but they all glitter and shine. INDY is mesmerized by their number and their beauty. And then he realizes that a man is praying at the altarl He has his back turned to INDY. but he is dressed as what he is! A GRAIL
KNIGHT: I knew you'd come, but my strength has left me.
INDY: Who are you?
KNIGHT: The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
INDY: That was seven hundred years ago.
KNIGHT: A long time to wait. The GRAIL KNIGHT reaches forward and fingers Indy's clothing.
KNIGHT: You're strangely dressed.for a I'm not exactly.a knight. What do you mean?
INDY: I'm not exactly.a knight. What do you mean?
KNIGHT: I was chosen because I was the bravest and the most worthy. The honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat. I pass it to you who vanquished me. The GRAIL KNIGHT holds his sword out to INDY.
INDY: ( gulp ) Listen, I don't have time to explain, but At that moment DONOVAN and ELSA appear. Donovan turns to face the display of cups.
DONOVAN: Which one is it?
KNIGHT: You must choose. But choose wisely. For as the True Grail will bring you life the False Grail will take it from I'm not a historian. I have no idea what it looks like. Which one is it?
DONOVAN: I'm not a historian. I have no idea what it looks like. Which one is it?
ELSA: Let me choose.
DONOVAN: Thank you, Doctor. ELSA and INDY exchange looks. He thinks he is seeing her in her true colors. ELSA chooses a cupa solid gold, emerald encrusted goblet. DONOVAN instantly takes it from her.
DONOVAN: Oh, yes. It's more beautiful than I'd ever imagined. This certainly is the cup of the King of Kings. DONOVAN rushes to the well and fills the goblet with water.
DONOVAN: Eternal life! DONOVAN drinks from the goblet. Then, DONOVAN'S entire body starts to convulse. His face contorts in agony. He grabs his stomach and turns toward ELSA.
DONOVAN: What . . . is . . . happening. . . to . . . me. . .? He starts to agefast! His hair grows long and gray and brittle. His face sinks. Fingernails curl back on themselves. Milky cataracts coat his eyes. ELSA gasps and screams.
DONOVAN: What. . . is . . . happening. . . ? His skin turns brown and leathery and stretches across his bones until it splits. His skeletal hands reach for ELSA's throat, choking her.
KNIGHT: He chose.poorly. INDY studies the array of chalices.
ELSA: It would not be made out of gold. INDY picks up another cupa simple earthenware jug.
INDY: That's the cup of a carpenter. He and ELSA exchange a look.
INDY: There's only one way to find out. INDY goes to the well and fills the earthenware jug with water, then pauses. INDY brings the jug to his lips and takes several large swallows. A strange sensation overcomes him, a feeling of peace and contentment.and we see his wounds begin to heal.
KNIGHT: You have chosen wisely. But the Grail cannot pass beyond the Great Seal. That is the boundary and the price of immortality.
NAZI SOLDIERS: run forward. SALLAH points a rifle at them.
SALLAH: Drop your guns. Please. The NAZI SOLDIERS drop their weapons at their feet and raise their arms in Dad, come on. Get to your feet.
INDY: ( to HENRY ) Dad, come on. Get to your feet.
ELSA: steps forward and picks up the Grail. She turns to INDY, her face alight with possession of the Grail.
ELSA: We have got it. Come on. ELSA steps onto the edge of the Great Seal.
INDY: Elsa! Elsa, don't movel
ELSA: It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
INDY: Elsa, don't cross the Seal. The Knight warned us not to take the Grail from here. A RUMBLING SOUND IS HEARD and the ground roars and shifts. Dirt falls from the ceiling of the cavern. ELSA falls on the Great Seal. The Grail bounces away from her grasp. She reaches for it and the ground beneath her begins to SPLIT OPEN. ELSA slips into the crevasse. She screams. ELSA is hanging perilously in the abyss, with the Grail almost within her reach. As her hands lose their grip, INDY just manages to one of them, he himself sliding forward across the slanted floor.
HENRY: Junior! Junior! With her free hand, ELSA is trying to get the Grail. INDY can't save her unless she gives him her free hand. She has to choose.
INDY: Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa. Give me your other hand, honey. I can't hold you.
ELSA: I can reach it. I can reach it. Her hand begins to slip from Indy's grasp.
INDY: Elsa! Give me your hand. Give me your other hand! ELSA just manages to touch the Grail. In doing so, she has tipped the balance too farINDY slides down another yard, Elsa loses her grip and falls screaming to her death.
INDY: ( horrified ) Now the ledge INDY lies upon begins to break apart. HENRY grabs one of his hands as Indy struggles to reach the Grail with the other.
HENRY: Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!
INDY: I can get itI can almost reach it, Dad. INDY looks down into the black bottomless pit beneath him from which nothing can ever be retrieved.
HENRY: Indiana. Indiana!! INDY snaps his look up to his father. His father has never called him this before.
HENRY: ( very calmly ) . let it go. INDY abandons the Grail and grabs onto HENRY with both hands. HENRY pulls him up to safety.
INDY: Dad. . . The GRAIL KNIGHT raises his arm to HENRY.
INDY: Please, Dad. INDY and HENRY down the passageway just as a huge stone column tumbles down upon the spot where they stood. The GRAIL KNIGHT lowers his arm as he watches them leave.
HENRY: Elsa never really believed in the Grail. She thought she'd found a What did vou find, Dad?
INDY: What did vou find, Dad?
HENRY: Me?. Illumination. HENRY and INDY mount their horses. Henry turns back to his son.
HENRY: What did you find, Junior?
INDY: Junior?! Dad.
SALLAH: Please.What does it always mean, this.this "Junior?"
HENRY: That's his name. Henry Jones, I like Indiana.
INDY: I like Indiana.
HENRY: We named the dog Indiana.
BRODY: May we go home now, please?
SALLAH: ( to INDY ) The dog!? ( laughs ) You are named after the dog.
INDY: ( embarrassed ) I've got a lot of fond memories of that dog. A moment passes as they all ready their mounts and SALLAH continues to laugh at INDY.
INDY: Indy! Henryl Follow met I know the way! Got lost in his own museum, huh?
HENRY: Indy! Henryl Follow met I know the way! Got lost in his own museum, huh?
BRODY: Indy! Henryl Follow met I know the way! Got lost in his own museum, huh?
HENRY: ( to INDY ) Got lost in his own museum, huh?
INDY: After you, Junior.
HENRY: After you, Junior.
INDY: Yes, sir! EXT. THE SECRET CANYON - AFTERNOON They THUNDER through the canyonwhose towering walls threaten to collapse upon them.
