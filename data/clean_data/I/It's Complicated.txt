JAKE: Happy happy happy...
(MORE): JAKE(cont'd) As long as I've known you both, you've always managed to somehow do everything entirely right.
SALLY: Aw, that's it?
JANE: I know, I hate it. Well... (Agness joins the group, standing next to Jake) Congrats again... (puts down her champagne) Great party...
JANE: (hates    this) Oh. Good.     That'll be convenient, actually.     Okay, so, see you soon.. (waves    awkwardly)
SALLY: That's crazy.
GABBY: Oh, God...that's all my clothes.
(MORE): HARLEY(cont'd) Okay, your Mom is home. She'll figure this out.
JANE: Gabby, you're leaving now? I thought you were going in the morning?
GABBY: Omigod. L.A.! Okay. I'm doing this. (walks to her car) Mom, you don't happen to know where Dad is, do you? I tried calling him to say goodbye...
JANE: -- It was.... (notices both girls wait for her answer) -- whatever. It was fine.
(MORE): JANE(cont'd) (Gabby texts, deep in convo ) Gabby!
GABBY: I will. I'll call you!
LAUREN: Knock `em dead, little one.
LAUREN: Maybe you should get a dog.
JANE: (quietly to a Young Employee) Check on table five, will you?
JANE: (all smiles) Peter!
PETER: Look what we've got.
ADAM: (raises the blueprints) Your plans.
JANE: (to Peter) So excited!
ADAM: I'm happy you like it.
JANE: Tuesday's great. Eight-thirty too early? At the house?
JANE: Is it?
DR. MOSS: Jane, what you need to fix this is a brow lift.
JAKE: Hiii.
JAKE: Honey, don't do that..
JAKE: (trying to be nonchalant with a kid on his head, smiles) See you there.
JANE: Trust me... I'm not not doing it on purpose.
JANE: Oh my Goddddddd.
JANE: (lifts her head, then talks as if she's in the doctor's office) "Dr. Moss, Hi. I have a little situation that needs fixing...."
HARLEY: So, what's up Luke?      Did you decide to have the party?
JANE: What party?
JANE: (to Host) Hi. Adler. One.
JAKE: You do. You always do.   Your hair's shorter.
JANE: Longer.
JAKE: I like it.
HOST: Mrs. Adler, your table's ready.
JAKE: So, come on. Once every ten years.
JANE: So...how are things in the fertility world?
JAKE: -- Just tell me, how long were you seeing him for?
JANE: -- Oh, yeah. That was such a fun night.
JAKE: So fun. You wore that white halter dress....
JANE: (remembering) Oh, yeahhhh.... (remembering it all, looks at Jake with a longing for her own past...)
JAKE: Want to dance?
JANE: -- No...!
JANE: (sexy....) Hey.... I know you.
JAKE: You okay?
JAKE: Ah, too bad. I'm on the five o'clock.
(MORE): JANE(cont'd) (kisses each kid as they line up) Thanks for staying. So proud of you. Be good. Call me if you need me. (she arrives at Jake, pauses, speechless)
JANE: It's 8:30 Tuesday morning!
ADAM: -- So if we move this wall back a bit, that can bring the arch forward, which is where you really want it, right?
JANE: Yes, I'd love that.
(MORE): JANE(cont'd) (sees Adam hesitate) Not possible?
JANE: Yeah...
JANE: It's not huge. (suddenly insecure) Why don't I show these to you when we get a little closer.
JANE: Sounds great.
ADAM: I'll e-mail you and we'll set it up. We did good work today. Jake, nice meeting you.
JAKE: (turns to Jane) Got time for a cup of coffee?
JANE: Yes! Because we're not supposed to have fun like that! We're divorced!   Are you like, what? Unhappy at home?   Does she not "understand" you? Did you just want to know what it would be like with someone my age? What is this?
JAKE: (turns to her) Why do you think the sex is so much sexier this time?
JANE: I've gotta get to work.
JAKE: (turning back to her) You know what I think -- just for the record? I think we're doing something kinda brilliant. All the things that tore us apart aren't issues anymore. I'd say our problems actually went away.
JAKE: Didn't you always say you felt you weren't being heard? Wasn't that our big issue -- both of us always feeling rejected and unappreciated. Look at us now. You're so much more together, you're not exhausted all the time, you're not catering every weekend and busy all day with the kids and I'm calmer, less obsessed about work. I'm a partner. I'm there. We grew into the people we wanted each other to be! And I don't know... I appreciate things about you I couldn't even see before.
(MORE): JANE(cont'd) Well, you know, I'm not as good as you at remembering all the details of our...
JAKE: And I know other divorced people think about this...they wonder - what if.... (fixes his tie) I think this is very French of us.
DIANE: Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.... You're not saying!!!!
JANE: Reynaldo, I'm changing the breakfast menu, want to give it a little more life... (shows it to him, he seems distracted) What do you think?
JANE: Caliente?
ADAM: Yeah, it's feeling really good. So, this becomes your office. We come down your new hallway, the windows are all along here...
JANE: Great. Love it.
ADAM: And from here to there...wait, let me get the door for you... (opens a piece of tape) Your kitchen. (they ENTER) We're in the eating area. How's the size? (pretends to sit) We're at either end of the table.
JANE: (taking it all in) This is heaven!
ADAM: It's gonna be cool.    Want to go upstairs?
AGNESS: What's he talking about?
ADAM: That looks amazing.
JANE: Thank you for taking my 47 e-mails and turning them into something so beautiful.
JANE: Well, I'm not all that used to being able to count on anyone...
ADAM: (surprised by that) Really?
JANE: Oh, no!
JANE: I don't blame her.
(MORE): JANE(cont'd) I know what it's like to have your ex remarried and to not have so much going on in that department. I mean, do you date ever or...
ADAM: Uh, constantly actually.
JANE: I have no idea why I keep saying that. I'm sorry. I'll stop.
JANE: Me?   Since before Lauren was born.
JANE: Are you kidding me? Put that away! It's been too long...
JAKE: Okay, why don't I leave this with you... (It's kind of amazing.) Maybe you'll take a few hits...
(MORE): JAKE(cont'd) get your sea legs, then we'll smoke the rest of it together.
(MORE): JANE(cont'd) Oh, you got a little ice cream on your shirt. Let me get that out.
JAKE: Don't get it.
JANE: I always get it. I have three kids. (Jake wishes she wouldn't. She hesitates, picks it up) Hello. Hiii... (makes an I told you so face) You still on the plane? How was Luke when you left? Oh, that sounds like fun. Let me know what I can bring..... No! Don't have any idea where he is. (points to Jake) Okay, honey, talk to you tomorrow. (hangs up) Now I'm lying...... Lauren and Harley are giving Luke a graduation party this weekend. Sweet, huh?
JANE: No, I just need to talk...and I was wondering if there was any chance you could squeeze me in for an emergency session. I'm sort of desperate for some advice. I brought you some of that coffee cake you like. Not as a bribe or anything...
DR. ALLEN: You know, things happen in life and our job is to find out why. What we have to do is take a real look at this. Are you ready to do that?
JANE: (digging out her Blackberry) Thanks. I e-mailed it to myself. (reads from Blackberry) Okay. Am I still trying to figure out why the marriage failed? Do I want to get back together? Do we have unfinished business? Is this about revenge?   Am I just... lonely? Or, is it my "caretaker" thing?
(MORE): JANE(cont'd) You know, the kids are finally gone and now all of a sudden Jake's back and I get to take care of him in some way...
JANE: And, listen, I get how therapy works, I do... We look at things, we examine them, weeks turn into months, what....? we're going on eight years, right?.... and I'm okay with that, I like it... but in this case, I need to know what you really think. Like, I'd like you to say... Don't do this, it's absolutely wrong or go ahead, you'll be fine. I actually want to be told what to do.
HARLEY: Ohhhh my sweet Lord....
JAKE: Uh....Lipitor, baby aspirin.. (whispers) Flomax.
JANE: I know. Because when you cheated, I didn't have to. But I think in some way, I gave up on us and I'm not sure you ever really did.
JAKE: I'm trying not to rock the boat at home until you and I figure this out. (sees her reaction) This is a little trickier at my end than yours.
JAKE: You'll make the whole thing?    The roast chicken, the---
JANE: (fixes Jake's hair) We have a date.
AGNESS: (not looking at him) Why are you taking your cell to the bathroom?
JANE: Two days ago you went to The Stanhope...for lunch?
HARLEY: Yes and guess what?    We saw nothing.
LAUREN: What is that supposed to mean?
HARLEY: Who wants wine? Anyone? (starts pouring)
GABBY: (looking in the fridge) Mom, you have an insane amount of food in here, even for you.
JANE: Harley?
JANE: Yay!!!! (hugs Luke)
JAKE: (holding Luke's backpack) Where should I put this...?
LAUREN: What's up?
JANE: Okay...What did you see and what do you know?
HARLEY: Nothing. Really.
HARLEY: (confesses rapidly) Okay, he checked in, you arrived, you met in the elevator, possible kiss there, Doctor went up, Doctor came down, thumbs up. That's it. Have no idea what happened in between.
JANE: (dying...) Have you told Lauren?
HARLEY: No and I won't --
LUKE: (joining them) Mom. Dad's leaving...
LUKE: (from the Dining Room) Thanks for picking me up, Dad...
ADAM: Do I...??
ADAM (O.S.): (fake falsetto) No one. Keep walking please.
SPOTS JAKE ACROSS THE: ROOM, seriously eyeing him.)
(MORE): ADAM(cont'd) Hey, there's your ex-husb-- Uh-Oh. He's headed right toward us. Not the time to be "feeling groovy" (dances again when he sees Jake in SLOW-MO getting closer and closer) Oooo. Why so intense, big fella?
JANE: Because there, is...fascinating. I mean, when you think about it, it sort of links us in some cosmic crazy way, doesn't it, Agness? Of all the men on the planet, we both said "I do" to this guy.
JAKE: Janey, can I talk to you for a quick sec?
JANE: He always needs me for a quick sec. (starts to exit) You okay?
ADAM: Oh, I'm very okay!
JANE: Care for a toke?
(MORE): JANE(cont'd) Oh, my God. Is that what I look like?
JANE: Wow. Fun is not overrated, is it?
JANE: Hungry?
JANE: Hey sleepy! What time did you get in?
GABBY: (looks out the front window) What's Dad doing here?
LUKE: What's up, Dad?
LAUREN: Problems on the home front?   Is one of you seeing someone else?
ADAM: (re-enters in an odd shirt) What about this?   I was in India and I had it made.
(MORE): ADAM(cont'd) The guy ran out of fabric so he didn't make me long sleeves. (looks down) Or short sleeves. It's weird.
JANE: But cute.
LUKE: Mom, are you and Dad getting back together?
JANE: I got this one...
HARLEY: I know you do.
ADAM: -- I would have taken the call.
JANE: I don't regret it either.
ADAM: Good morning.
JANE: Anything...
ADAM: You wouldn't happen to have any of those amazing chocolate croissants, would you?
ADAM: I have incredibly fond memories of them.
JANE: I don't have any here, but we could go into town and get some... right out of the oven.
ADAM: You want to do that?
JANE: Yeah... love to.
