CHARLIE: SWISH PAN TO: LYLE, 21, brilliant and punctilious, fingering the keyboard of his strap-on supercharged laptop.
LYLE: I've got the orbital data and SV clock corrections for each satellite that gets the signal. That'll make my reading as solid as the Precise Positioning Service that only the D.O.D. can use. We're talkin' 100 meter horizontal accuracy, 156 meter vertical accuracy, .340 nanoseconds time accuracy.
STEVE: Why can't he talk like a person?
CHARLIE: .Because he's not.
LYLE: I do need one more thing, Charlie.
CHARLIE: What's that?
LYLE: Someone to turn the goddamn homing device on. No signal, no score.
CHARLIE: ( to Steve ) Where're the Italians?
STEVE: INT. HUMVEE ( MOVING ) - SAME TIME The driver is HANDSOME ROB, 30. Riding shotgun is HALF-EAR, 35, immersed in a book: Albert Einstein Creator & Rebel. Half-Ear is a large black man with a Southern accent and a hearing aid.
HANDSOME ROB: What's that shit?
HANDSOME ROB: You wanna read something. Read between the lines.
HANDSOME ROB: Lemme see that book.
JOHN BRIDGER: Hi, sweetie.
STELLA: Daddy. How are you?
JOHN BRIDGER: I'm sending you something.
STELLA: Really? Does it smell nice?
JOHN BRIDGER: No. But it's sparkly.
STELLA: Does it come with a receipt?
JOHN BRIDGER: I'm having it sent to you from the Why not bring it by yourself? We could have dinner.
STELLA: ( toweling her hair ) Why not bring it by yourself? We could have dinner.
JOHN BRIDGER: Be a long trip. I'm in Genoa.
STELLA: Let me guess. Checking out the birthplace of Christopher Columbus.
JOHN BRIDGER: Something like that.
STELLA: With your parole officer's approval.
JOHN BRIDGER: I think I've paid my P.O. my last visit. I liked the guy, but we never really connected.
STELLA: What are you into, Dad? Don't break my heart. You told me you were After this, I swear to you, I am.
JOHN BRIDGER: After this, I swear to you, I am.
STELLA: You promised me. Daddy, don't do
JOHN BRIDGER: Everything's going to be fine. I've got to go now. I love you. Bye.
JOHN BRIDGER: Not yet.
CHARLIE: Not yet.
STEVE: Don't worry, they'll come through. You can trust these guys.
JOHN BRIDGER: I trust everyone. It's the devil inside them that I don't trust. Got a sec?
CHARLIE: My office.
JOHN BRIDGER: How you feeling, boss?
CHARLIE: Fine. I'm fine, fine.
JOHN BRIDGER: You know what fine, stands for, don't you? Fucked-up, Insecure, Neurotic, and Emotional.
CHARLIE: You've become quite the philosopher since you quit drinking.
JOHN BRIDGER: You don't like me sober?
CHARLIE: No, I'm glad. Makes you a better
JOHN BRIDGER: For after the haul.
CHARLIE: Hope I get to fire it up. If Steve's Italians are a no-show, it's three months prep down the shitter and I've dragged you out of retirement for nothing.
JOHN BRIDGER: This is kinda nice. You being the boss with all the worries, me just along for the ride.
CHARLIE: Ain't you sweet.
CHARLIE: Your Italians.
STEVE: Yup. Dixie cups.
CHARLIE: Dixie cups?
STEVE: I toss 'em away if there's a problem down the road.
LYLE: For those about to rock, we salute
HANDSOME ROB: Let's get rich.
CHARLIE: Let's get rich.
HANDSOME ROB: Can you chill out back there? You'd make a hummingbird nervous.
UNDERWATER: The huge, heavy crate drops down. down. hits the bottom.
CHARLIE: Sweet Jesus.
JOHN BRIDGER: "That for which all virtue is sold. And almost every vice gold."
JOHN BRIDGER: My name is John and I'm a very rich alcoholic. And I'm going to live my life one very rich day at a time.
THE CREW: Alright, John!
JOHN BRIDGER: You planned this one down to a t, kid. It's a gift. You saw the big picture, made contingencies, covered the angles.
JOHN BRIDGER: Shit, you made thirty million dollars in gold drop out of sight without holding a gun. Who else could've pulled that off?
CHARLIE: You could've. I had big shoes to Fill the shoes but don't follow the What're you talking about? You've lived the life.
JOHN BRIDGER: Fill the shoes but don't follow the What're you talking about? You've lived the life.
CHARLIE: What're you talking about? You've lived the life.
JOHN BRIDGER: My life's been nothing but fake IDs, fake business cards and divorce papers. This is the only thing that's
CHARLIE: Stella's a beautiful girl.
JOHN BRIDGER: She's amazing. And I spent half her childhood in prison. This is a once in a lifetime haul, Charlie. Bring down the curtain after this one. Make a new life. Find someone amazing and be there for her.
HANDSOME ROB: Click. That's the sound of a gun cocking as it's pressed against Handsome Rob's temple.
STEVE: Anyone acts stupid and his brains go on the windshield.
CHARLIE: What the hell do you think you're Sorry Charlie. But I want the box of Cracker Jack all to myself. You're not thinking this through. It's a stupid move.
STEVE: Sorry Charlie. But I want the box of Cracker Jack all to myself. You're not thinking this through. It's a stupid move.
CHARLIE: You're not thinking this through. It's a stupid move.
STEVE: Think so? Well you're the brilliant one. The Master Planner. Isn't that so, John?
STEVE: You bet on the wrong horse.
JOHN BRIDGER: We'll hunt you down. You're gonna regret this.
STEVE: No regrets, Dixie cup.
FIRST COP: You always work in the dark?
STELLA: Buzz of the fluorescents throws me off. She's all yours.
SECOND COP: Damn. Chris Perley couldn't crack it. Neither could Michael Hoyt.
STELLA: Now you know who to call first.
FIRST COP: You're expensive, Stella. Those guys cut us a break on subpoena jobs. Goodwill, community service.
STELLA: Well I do it for the money. I'll send you the bill.
SECOND COP: Don't you want to see what's inside?
STELLA: I never look. Bye, guys.
HER SHOP: Antique keys and locks dominate the storefront window with the name of the shop stenciled across the glass: BRIDGER LOCK AND SAFE COMPANY. Stella hops out of the Mini. With a poised walk she heads inside.
RECEPTIONIST: How long?
STELLA: Four minutes, forty-three seconds. You're the man.
RECEPTIONIST: You're the man.
STELLA: So what's on the line-up?
RECEPTIONIST: 2:00. Home safe in Fairmount Park. Owner died and the wife never knew the combination. And Todd Milliken called. He has a prototype combination lock he wants you to test out tomorrow morning. Says he added two false contact points on the tumbler.
STELLA: Tell him if I don't have it opened in six minutes flat, breakfast is on And there's a Charlie Croker in your office. He said you two know each And he looks pretty fine for a white
RECEPTIONIST: And there's a Charlie Croker in your office. He said you two know each And he looks pretty fine for a white
STELLA: Charlie Croker.
CHARLIE: Hi, Stella.
STELLA: Refresh my memory. After you came to see me and told me what happened to my father, I told you I never wanted to see you again, didn't I?
CHARLIE: Yeah. You did.
STELLA: So I'm a little confused.
CHARLIE: I found him.
CHARLIE: I can tell you where he is.
STELLA: I don't want to know.
CHARLIE: Are you sure?
CHARLIE: He's in Los Angeles.
CHARLIE: The gold bricks he stole from us were minted in Singapore and decorated with the face of a Balinese girl. I've had my tentacles out and got a call from a friend of mine and your father's, Philly Steak.
STELLA: When I was little he would play poker at the house and drop quarters under the table for me to find.
CHARLIE: He got word from an L.A. connection named Skinny Pete that a gold dealer has been buying bricks with the Balinese girl on them, three or four at a time.
STELLA: You ever heard the expression, cut to the chase?
CHARLIE: I tracked Steve down to an address in the Hollywood Hills. He's changed his last name to Frezelli. And get this: he had a Worthington 1000 installed in the house before he even moved in. We both know that you don't install a Worthington 1000 unless you have something precious to guard.
STELLA: Precious or not, I don't deal with ill-gotten goods.
CHARLIE: We boosted that gold from a terrorist group that was about to trade it for bio-weapons. Now that doesn't exactly make us Robin Hood, but maybe in our own little way we were doing a good deed. Problem is, no one in my crew can handle that safe. And I need someone I can trust.
STELLA: And you think that's me? Haven't you heard that I work for the other side?
CHARLIE: What I heard is that you have your father's touch. And he was the only safecracker I knew who could open a Worthington 1000.
STELLA: I'm not a safecracker. I'm a professional safe and vault You're John Bridger's daughter. And this is our chance to set things
CHARLIE: You're John Bridger's daughter. And this is our chance to set things
STELLA: Our chance? Who do you think you are coming in here? Stealing the gold isn't going to bring my father back to life.
CHARLIE: No, it won't.
STELLA: Then get out.
HANDSOME ROB: How'd it go with the chick?
CHARLIE: I'm working on it.
HANDSOME ROB: I don't want her on the crew, Charlie.
CHARLIE: Gotta have her. Important piece of the puzzle.
HANDSOME ROB: There has to be someone else. What about Bill Huchins?
CHARLIE: Doing ten long at Levinworth.
HANDSOME ROB: Red O'Reilly?
CHARLIE: HANDSOME ROB
HANDSOME ROB: Martin Hernandez?
CHARLIE: Found Jesus.
HANDSOME ROB: I don't want a civilian to screw this up.
CHARLIE: She has the skill. And the motivation.
HANDSOME ROB: Exactly. She's emotional. You know what happens when emotion gets into It's emotional for all of us at this point. Don't kid yourself.
CHARLIE: It's emotional for all of us at this point. Don't kid yourself.
RICHARD: It's all in my patented sideways glance. Like this.
RICHARD: I hit each woman on the jury with one of these. We make contact. And I know exactly what they're doing. Undressing me with their eyes.
STELLA: I see.
RICHARD: The case is all but won. That's why in jury selection I choose as many women as possible. Except lesbians, of course. I can tell in sixty seconds if they're a lesbian. Want to know how I know?
STELLA: If they don't undress you with their Precisely. Like that waitress right there. See? She's looking at me right below my belt. Definitely not a
RICHARD: Precisely. Like that waitress right there. See? She's looking at me right below my belt. Definitely not a
STELLA: Your fly.
RICHARD: I am fly. And I'm da bomb. Just wait until later tonight.
BUSBOY: Oh, man. I'm sorry.
RICHARD: You should be. Moron. What the hell's wrong with you?
BUSBOY: It was an accident. I'm very sorry.
RICHARD: Where's the manager? Richard Worth is not paying to have his suit cleaned. Damn. I'm going to. I don't believe this.
CHARLIE: I think your date's going pretty well, what do you think?
STELLA: What are you doing here?
CHARLIE: What do you mean? I come here all the time.
STELLA: I don't think so.
CHARLIE: Sure. Lawyers, Judges, my kind of crowd. See that gentleman there, he sentenced me to 90 days in county once. We need to talk.
STELLA: No, you need to listen. I want you to leave. Got it?
CHARLIE: Hey, I paid valet parking prices to get in here, not to mention a twenty spot to the busboy to spill that drink on Mister Zipper.
STELLA: You I don't believe this. You paid someone to spill that drink?
CHARLIE: Actually, you paid for it.
CHARLIE: Didn't notice it was me who bumped into you earlier, did you? Anyway, I was hoping we could get to know each other a little better before we leave for Los Angeles. I already booked your flight.
STELLA: You truly are a fatuous, odious man.
CHARLIE: I have no idea what you just said, but I like the sound of it.
STELLA: Well maybe you'll understand this. Hit the road, Jack
CHARLIE: Or you'll be sorry, Charlie, cause I'll kick you in the nuts so hard that your voice will be as high as my heels.
STELLA: Or you'll be sorry, Charlie, cause I'll kick you in the nuts so hard that your voice will be as high as my heels.
CHARLIE: I'm beginning to worry about this whole relationship.
STELLA: I'll let you in on a secret. You can't have a relationship with a pickpocket, gold robber, or any kind of thief.
CHARLIE: John wasn't just a man I crewed up with, he was my friend, he was the closest thing to a father I ever had. I wish to God I could bring him back. But all I can do is go after this guy, the guy that killed him, and hit him where he lives.
RICHARD: Everything alright, Stella?
STELLA: Fine. Richard. Charlie. Charlie was just saying goodbye.
RICHARD: Can I help you with something?
CHARLIE: Oh, sorry. I was just undressing you with my eyes.
CHARLIE: INT. STELLA'S BEDROOM - INTERCUT She's on the other end of the line.
STELLA: I'm in this for one thing, Charlie, and one thing only. I want to see the look on his face when his gold is gone. He took my father from me, I'm taking this; it's the best I can
CHARLIE: I see Drive Defensively is your motto.
STELLA: Don't worry. Jack Daniels never let me down.
CHARLIE: By the way you drive, I'm not surprised you named your car after a bottle of whiskey. Left.
STELLA: Jack Daniels was chief engineer of the Mini. And I drive it exactly the way it was meant to be driven.
CHARLIE: Another left.
STELLA: We're going in circles. Who's tailing you this week?
CHARLIE: The possibilities are endless.
STELLA: Where are they?
CHARLIE: We're a little early. I didn't expect us to get here quite that fast.
CHARLIE: That's Lyle. Gearhead. He's who really invented Napster.
CHARLIE: Half-Ear. Explosives. He lost fifty percent of his hearing in the fifth
KID: That was rad!
CHARLIE: Handsome Rob. Premier wheel man. He once drove all the way to L.A. just so he could set the record for longest freeway chase.
STELLA: And what about you?
CHARLIE: I've been a thief since I had baby
BULLY: Cough it up, Charlie!
CLASSMATE: So much for lunch.
CLASSMATE: I thought he took your last one.
CHARLIE: This is Stella. She's working with us on this one. IDs?
LYLE: ( reading his ) Melvin Lisp? Could I just once have a cool name?
HANDSOME ROB: Try 'Deal A Meal'.
LYLE: I don't even have a cool nickname.
CHARLIE: Enough of this sewing-circle shit.
CHARLIE: We travel to L.A. separately.
LYLE: You still haven't told us the most important thing. What exactly is the job, Charlie? And who exactly is
CHARLIE: This is Stella Bridger. And we're finishing the job that we started in
CHARLIE: We need an in to get a video blueprint of the interior. We're not going into this place blind. Half-Ear, you take the first surveillance shift. Who goes in, who goes out, levels of security, you know the drill.
CHARLIE: I also want audio surveillance on his phone.
LYLE: I'll hack into the phone company's central office remote observance monitoring system and fool it into thinking there's a legal tap on the line. Reroute the digital copies of his calls to our own listening post.
CHARLIE: How long?
LYLE: I'll burn through the night, have it up and running before morning.
CHARLIE: ( to Handsome Rob ) We need to know how long to get from the house to Union Station downtown.
HANDSOME ROB: No problemo.
CHARLIE: Stella. How much time will you need with the safe?
STELLA: I'll have it open in five minutes It's not the same as opening a safe for the cops. Your heart will be pounding in your ears. Perspiration on your fingertips. It's a whole different ball game.
HANDSOME ROB: It's not the same as opening a safe for the cops. Your heart will be pounding in your ears. Perspiration on your fingertips. It's a whole different ball game.
STELLA: You get me to the safe, I'll open
LYLE: ( into micro cassette player ) Advent Home Navigator Hybrid System. Monitors 132 points for intrusion, fire, and environmental hazards. Best way around it is to get a back door password, trip the alarm during the heist, then call it in as a false
LYLE: ( into micro cassette recorder ) 15:25. There he is. He's gained 15 to 20 pounds living off our money. And Handsome Rob, you're going to be pissed when you see his wheels.
CHARLIE: ( into micro cassette recorder ) Housekeeper leaves at 17:30.
YEVHEN: You're right on time.
YEVHEN: All those poor bastards out there putting their life savings in banks and S&Ls and mutual funds. What do they think that when the collapse comes they can depend on the government? I don't think so.
STEVE: Is the camera off?
YEVHEN: Of course. Just like you said. I never tape you, you can see for
YEVHEN: Governments are nothing more than puppets on the strings of the Trilateral Commission with their twisted gods.
YEVHEN: I mean, it's so obvious that in a world where NAFTA can overturn the Supreme Court, not to mention Microsoft's nefarious financial machinations, this, is our only refuge; gold.
YEVHEN: Plus a little walking around money.
HANDSOME ROB: Where's a grenade launcher when you need one?
HANDSOME ROB: Doesn't matter what time it is. It's either bad traffic, peak traffic, or slit-your-wrists traffic.
HANDSOME ROB: I'm sure it's ideal for carrying a ton of gold, genius.
CHARLIE: What's your guesstimate?
HANDSOME ROB: If we had all green lights, fourteen minutes. But in the twenty times I've done it, the average is thirty- two minutes, with a top time of fifty Then we'll travel like Rockefeller.
CHARLIE: Then we'll travel like Rockefeller.
CHARLIE: When cars first started catching on, workers on tall ladders would use these swiveling colored boards for traffic signals. Now whenever Rockefeller would take the drive from his mansion to his office on Wall Street, the workers would make sure that he got green boards all the way.
HANDSOME ROB: How do we get all green lights?
CHARLIE: Let me see what I can do.
LYLE: Let me see what I can do.
HANDSOME ROB: We still need an in to get the video Carpet cleaners? Gutter cleaners? Flower delivery?
LYLE: Carpet cleaners? Gutter cleaners? Flower delivery?
CHARLIE: We'll never get by the guard unless they're certain it's legit. I'm thinking cable TV. We cut his cable, he calls the cable company. We show up. Send a cable technician into the house with a pinhole video camera while we get a feed through an RF Who plays cable technician? Steve thinks we're all dead.
HANDSOME ROB: Who plays cable technician? Steve thinks we're all dead.
STELLA: If you're all dead, I guess I'm the man for the job.
CHARLIE: Are you up for it?
STELLA: In for a penny, in for a pound.
LYLE: I'm telling you. He claims he named it Napster because his hair is so nappy underneath that cap of his. But I know the real reason. It's because I was NAPPING when he stole the idea from me. I should've been on the cover of Wired magazine.
HANDSOME ROB: Would you clam up. You'd give a woodpecker a headache.
LYLE: I'm the Napster.
HANDSOME ROB: Okay. You're the Napster. Heads up: cable chick.
LYLE: Becky. Nice name. I wonder what she calls the other one.
HANDSOME ROB: And it's such a mystery why you don't have a girlfriend.
LYLE: I had a girlfriend. Unfortunately even though the relationship ceased in an objective reality, it's still going on in my mind. That woman's lived in here rent-free for four years.
LYLE: Okay. All we need now is a work shirt like this one and a service truck like that one. You think Stella will be able to pull it off?
HANDSOME ROB: I have my doubts, but there's no talking to Charlie.
LYLE: Maybe he's been inserting his hard drive into her software. Clouds the He knows better than to mix business with pleasure. Only I'm allowed to do that.
HANDSOME ROB: He knows better than to mix business with pleasure. Only I'm allowed to do that.
LYLE: Where you going?
HANDSOME ROB: To get a work shirt and a service
SECURITY GUARD: What can I do for you, Mister The cable's out. See if you can get someone over here to fix it'.
STEVE: The cable's out. See if you can get someone over here to fix it'.
SECURITY GUARD: Yes, sir.
LYLE: Whoa. I've never heard the Muzak version of Purple Haze before.
CHARLIE: When's the appointment?
LYLE: Thursday between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m.
SECURITY GUARD: Yes, I'm calling from Adelphia Cable. I understand your service is out and an appointment was set up for Well we have a technician working in your area who finished with an appointment earlier than expected. Will someone be there for the next Sure. That'd be great.
CHARLIE: Yes, I'm calling from Adelphia Cable. I understand your service is out and an appointment was set up for Well we have a technician working in your area who finished with an appointment earlier than expected. Will someone be there for the next Sure. That'd be great.
SECURITY GUARD: Well we have a technician working in your area who finished with an appointment earlier than expected. Will someone be there for the next Sure. That'd be great.
CHARLIE: Well we have a technician working in your area who finished with an appointment earlier than expected. Will someone be there for the next Sure. That'd be great.
SECURITY GUARD: Sure. That'd be great.
CHARLIE: Our technician will see you then. Have a nice day.
SECURITY GUARD: You too.
CHARLIE: Let's check the camera.
LYLE: Stella, you're going patriotic today.
CHARLIE: He's got cable lines in the kitchen, living room, bedroom and a cable modem on the computer in the office. Try to get a 360 look at each room. And walk slowly or the image will
LYLE: I printed these up to look like paperwork from Adelphia. When you're done, ask him to sign and date the
CHARLIE: How you doing?
STELLA: Fine. I'm fine.
CHARLIE: You know what fine, stands for? Fucked- up, Insecure
HANDSOME ROB: Girls girls girls. Philly Steak said we'd be frisked.
HANDSOME ROB: ( scowls ) Y'got a great job.
BURLY MAN: Pays the rent, asshole. You got a problem, talk to Skinny Pete.
SKINNY PETE: Philly Steak sent you?
SKINNY PETE: So was I right-on about the gold bricks or what?
SKINNY PETE: What do you need?
SKINNY PETE: Nine p.m.
HANDSOME ROB: Should we hang here? Check out the Nothing's going down here. I don't shit in my own yard, do you?
SKINNY PETE: Nothing's going down here. I don't shit in my own yard, do you?
HANDSOME ROB: No, but I take a whizz off the deck
SKINNY PETE: Five thousand dollars. And don't be
STEVE: It's all right. They won't bother you now. It's okay. I'm used to running into all sorts of dogs on my job.
STELLA: It's okay. I'm used to running into all sorts of dogs on my job.
STEVE: I'm Steve.
STELLA: She shakes his hand. She hates this, feeling his skin touch hers, but she can't betray her feelings. He stands there a
STELLA: You want to show me the problem?
STEVE: Yeah. Course. This way.
STELLA: I'd like to check the cable modem
STEVE: I'll show you.
OFFICE: She turns her body so the mini-lens can stare at the gleaming black Worthington 1000 safe. Then she goes up to his desk and pretends to work on the cable line that feeds into his computer.
STEVE: The cable guy who hooked this up weighed about 300 pounds, didn't wear any underwear, and his pants slung a little too low if you know what I mean. There we go. Now onto the TVs.
STELLA: There we go. Now onto the TVs.
STEVE: Is it fixed?
STELLA: Turn it on and see.
STEVE: Then it looks like you're all set.
STELLA: Then it looks like you're all set.
STEVE: Have we met before?
STELLA: I don't think so. Sign here, please.
STELLA: You read my mind.
STEVE: You read my mind.
STELLA: Oh, no. I meant that I need you to put the date by your signature. It's the 26th.
STEVE: I know what you meant. This might seem a little sudden, but. would you like to have dinner with me?
STELLA: I don't think that'd be a very good Why? Is there some kind of cable- rule against dating customers?
STEVE: Why? Is there some kind of cable- rule against dating customers?
STELLA: No, it's my rule. I don't accept dates from men I've just met. I've only known you five minutes.
STEVE: Then I guess I'll have to sabotage my cable over and over again until you get to know me better.
STEVE: Look, I'm just talking about dinner. Friday night. It's no big deal. If you don't like me, you never have to see me again. You know I'm not going to stop until you say yes.
CHARLIE: I know it was tough in there.
STELLA: He touched my hand. And he came-on to me. That slimy, disgusting man came onto me and I had to pretend that I liked it.
STELLA: You do know what this means. I've created our window of opportunity.
CHARLIE: I know. When Steve leaves Friday night, we go in. By the time he realizes you've stood him up, we'll be long gone with the gold.
HANDSOME ROB: The guy makes Jabba the Hut look like a spokesman for the Subway Sandwiches' diet.
HANDSOME ROB: I'm trying not to.
HOMEBOY: What'd you put in the trunk?
HOMEBOY: Just gimme the keys before I pop a cap in your head. Hurry up!
HOMEBOY: Hurry up!
CHARLIE: Looks like that went without a hitch.
CHARLIE: Lyle, what's the distance from the front door to the vault?
CHARLIE: Handsome Rob leans over to Charlie.
HANDSOME ROB: He only answers to The Napster now.
CHARLIE: I'm not calling you The Napster.
LYLE: You call him Half-Ear.
LYLE: And him, Handsome Rob.
CHARLIE: That's only cause he is Handsome And I'm The Napster.
LYLE: And I'm The Napster.
CHARLIE: How far? The Napster.
LYLE: Five hundred yards.
CHARLIE: So here's the riddle. How do we get over a ton of gold from the vault to the getaway car?
STELLA: How wide is the hallway?
LYLE: Only six feet.
STELLA: Jack Daniels, straight up.
CHARLIE: We could rumble right up the front steps, bring the getaway car right to the vault, and then straight to Union Station.
STELLA: We could rumble right up the front steps, bring the getaway car right to the vault, and then straight to Union Station.
HANDSOME ROB: We'll need three to hold the gold.
HANDSOME ROB: I'd say you're a Maserati 250 S. Just 4 cylinders but can go 0 to 60 in 4.2.
COUNTER BABE: As long as it's a convertible I always like to have my top down.
COUNTER BABE: Do you know them?
HANDSOME ROB: Never seen 'em before in my life.
YEVHEN: You're early.
STEVE: And I'm in a hurry, okay?
YEVHEN: Of course the Florida vote rigging was a CIA and Mob operation.
STEVE: ( with total disinterest ) That a fact?
YEVHEN: You want facts? Fact: CIA officials were allowed free and illegal access to official election material. Now given the sordid history in Miami of joint ventures between Central Intelligence and the Mob, which led to the unsuccessful attempts to kill Fidel Castro and the successful assassination of your President John F. Kennedy, this conjunction raises numerous red flags.
YEVHEN: Now given the sordid history in Miami of joint ventures between Central Intelligence and the Mob, which led to the unsuccessful attempts to kill Fidel Castro and the successful assassination of your President John F. Kennedy, this conjunction raises numerous red flags.
STEVE: And I'd love to hear more about it, but like I said.
YEVHEN: Don't worry, we'll have you out in no time. The cash is on its way.
STEVE: On its way?
YEVHEN: My cousin is bringing it over.
STEVE: Your cousin?
YEVHEN: Yes. Cousin Mashkov.
STEVE: He's on his way?
YEVHEN: Don't worry, he will be here any
STEVE: The tape's off?
YEVHEN: Of course. Believe me, he doesn't want to be on video, either.
STEVE: Yevhen. Didn't I tell you, many times, that I never wanted to meet with anyone but you?
YEVHEN: I know. But it's his cash. He uses me to launder money. I'm just a And a middleman is supposed to stay in the middle.
STEVE: And a middleman is supposed to stay in the middle.
YEVHEN: But you were early. Please. Don't worry. It will be fine. My cousin's a cool guy. Like I am.
STEVE: What you are, is a Dixie cup.
YEVHEN: Dixie cup?
MASHKOV: My cousin Yevhen was beaten to death.
DANYA: By who?
MASHKOV: That's what I'm going to find out.
DANYA: And what will you do when you find this piece of shit who killed your I'll hack off his limbs and bury him while he's still alive.
MASHKOV: I'll hack off his limbs and bury him while he's still alive.
DANYA: Okay. But now we should stop talking Ukrainian, it's rude to my girl.
ENGLISH ): How are you tonight, Karen?
KAREN: Then eat your Frosted Flakes.
DANYA: Then eat your Frosted Flakes.
KAREN: ( like Tony the Tiger ) They're grrrreat!
DANYA: Such a perfect girl.

LYLE: The Traffic Control Center is on the top floor of a building on Olympic and Grand. They get their data from pavement loop detectors and video image vehicle detectors. That info is fused together by specially designed algorithms to predict traffic conditions and control the traffic lights. So all I have to do now is change the data by creating my own What can I do to help?

LYLE: For those about to rock, we salute
CHARLIE: This is it, guys. Moment of truth.
HIS POV: The neighbor across the street from Steve is having the biggest party in town. The road is filled with parked cars and arriving guests. Ain't no way they're blowing the gate, launching chemical grenades or in any way robbing Steve's house in the midst of this.
CHARLIE'S FACE: As he takes this in, there's a KNOCK on the window. He turns. Sees a uniformed VALET. Rolls down the window.

STELLA: Let go of my wrist. What is wrong with you? It's just a saying.
STEVE: No wonder I liked you right away. Just like I liked your old man, right up until the moment I shot him in the head. Now tell me who you're working with and tell me the plan. Do it now or we'll go for a ride and I'll break every bone in your body.
CHARLIE: Something wrong, Steve? You look like you want to call Ghostbusters.
STEVE: Fine by me. But it's you that has the problem.
LYLE: How do you figure?
STEVE: You've just blown the one thing you had going in your favor, the element of surprise. And I was surprised. Jesus Christ when I saw all you guys come out of the woodwork.

Cause you thought you'd gotten away with it free and clear. You thought you'd gotten rid of us. You're the one who's screwed. Right to the wall.
STEVE: Give it your best shot. I'll outsmart you every step of the way. And this time, I'll bury you myself.
CHARLIE: ( taking the challenge ) Get more guards. Change the alarm. Buy a dozen Ferraris. We'll still be here. Sleep tight.

SKINNY PETE: You work for Danya.
MASHKOV: Yes. And you are gonna be straight with me and everything's gonna be okay. You fuck with me, I will be I understand.
SKINNY PETE: I understand.
MASHKOV: I don't want you to understand. I want you to overstand.
SKINNY PETE: Overstand. Okay.
MASHKOV: Because if you don't overstand, I will use this.
MASHKOV: Someone was asking about gold bars with a Balinese girl's face on them. I want the name of this man.
LYLE: Well we scared him alright. He's flying the coop. His security guard called Brink's Armored Car Service to confirm a 5 p.m. pick up at his house, then JetClub to confirm a MD11 cargo plane departing from the Imperial Terminal at LAX at 8 p.m.
CHARLIE: Confirmed? How'd we miss the first They must have been cellular. The cargo plane is being chartered to Mexico City.

HANDSOME ROB: Meaning what the fuck?
CHARLIE: We've been trying to get to the gold in the safe. Now the safe is coming to us. We'll boost it in transit. Charlie. He could take a dozen different routes to the airport and we have no idea which one. We can't take out an armored truck during rush hour.
HANDSOME ROB: Charlie. He could take a dozen different routes to the airport and we have no idea which one. We can't take out an armored truck during rush hour.
CHARLIE: We're already set to do it. Napster: how would you like to create the biggest traffic jam in the history of Los Angeles?
LYLE: Keep talking.
CHARLIE: You gridlock every route except the one we choose. Force the truck to go exactly where we want it to go.
HANDSOME ROB: But where do we want it? We can't shoot it out with armed guards in a Brink's. We'd lose. And even if we pulled it off, the cops would be all over us, chasing us all the way to Union Station. We're outmanned and But not outsmarted.
CHARLIE: But not outsmarted.
CHARLIE: We'll do it like the Italian job. We'll make thirty million in gold drop out of sight.

PHILLY STEAK: Yevhen. The Ukrainian gold, dealer. You didn't, have to clip him, for Christ's sakes.
CHARLIE: Clip him?
PHILLY STEAK: Listen to me. You've gotta get out of L.A. Now.
CHARLIE: What're you talking about? We didn't clip anybody.
PHILLY STEAK: Well Skinny Pete just called me. Yevhen's cousin is under the distinct impression that you did.
CHARLIE: Why does he think that?
PHILLY STEAK: Because you wanted, to know about the gold with the Balinese Girl. Plus I guess Pete was under duress. This Ukrainian thinks he's Paul Fucking Bunyan.
CHARLIE: Do you know how to get in touch with Yeah but.
PHILLY STEAK: Yeah but.
CHARLIE: Maybe there's a way we can play this to our advantage.
PHILLY STEAK: Are you out of your mind? Listen to me, Charlie. Get out of L.A. Now. Cause if there's one thing I know, it's that you never mess with Mother Nature, mother-in-laws, or mother- fucking Ukrainians.
MASHKOV: He's going to be on Train 59 for New You sure your source is good?
UKRAINIAN: You sure your source is good?
MASHKOV: I'm sure.
CHARLIE: Still hope for that Nobel Prize.
CHARLIE: No shit. I thought you dropped out of high school.

LYLE: Where's the first camera the trucks will go past?
CHARLIE: Where's the first camera the trucks will go past?
LYLE: Cahuenga Boulevard. They all have to cross that.

MOTORCYCLE GUARD: It comes out at Flower
CHARLIE: We HEAR Stella's heart pounding in her ears. See the perspiration on her fingertips.
STELLA: We HEAR Stella's heart pounding in her ears. See the perspiration on her fingertips.
STELLA: You know when you said this wouldn't be the same as opening a safe for the cops?
HANDSOME ROB: Did you have to be right?
STELLA: Did you have to be right?
CHARLIE: Don't you want to see what's inside?
STELLA: I never look.

CENTER COURT: where OUR L.A. LAKERS are in the midst of practice. The Minis do look like matchbox cars next to these towering players. The car's tires leave a streak of rubber on the parquet floor. The team clears a path. The car is off the court before they know it. But now the players see the motorcycle coming down the aisle. See the guns. See security guards running after it. KOBE BRYANT picks up a basketball. The motorcycle charges across center court. Kobe aims. hurls the ball. It RAMS into the motorcycle's handlebars. The bike spins out of control and into a nasty fall, spitting off the riders while

LYLE: How about far, far away?
KAREN: The farther the better.
CHARLIE: Going up?
THE MOTORCYCLE: going full throttle to make the final rooftop to rooftop But its front wheel hits the edge slightly off-kilter. It soars but with a slight downward trajectory. Towards a large window on the top floor. Then lower. And the look on the driver's face says it all as. The front wheel of the motorcycle SMACKS into the side of the building, just below the window. The guards are flung off the bike and their bodies CRASH through the window as A hunk of exploding metal imbeds itself in the side of the LAPD chopper and
