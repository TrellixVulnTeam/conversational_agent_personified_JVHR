DRIVER: The figure with backpack and rifle, henceforth BACKPACK, stopping in his tracks, turns around in the direction of the truck.
BACKPACK: Keep it.
DRIVER: I don't want your money. And I already have a watch.
BACKPACK: If you don't take it, I'm gonna throw it away. I don't want to know what time it is, what day it is, or where I am.
DRIVER: ( handing him the boots ) Take em. If you make it out alive, give me a call, and I'll tell you how to get the boots back to me. Hey, do me a favor, will ya? Take a picture of me.
BACKPACK: Hey, do me a favor, will ya? Take a picture of me.
DRIVER: You gonna be alright?
BACKPACK: I'll be better than that.
DAY: May 1990 The crowd of family and friends, and of course, students. Assembled on fold-out chairs. The broad lawn. INTERCUT: CHRIS MCCANDLESS. We don't see his face, just feet pounding the pavement at an increasing pace. One by one the names of graduates announced. Their bright young faces, capped heads, and gowns, glide up to the podium to accept their diplomas. INTERCUT: Chris, on his run, sweatshirt hood over head. Amongst assembled crowd and family we find: THE MCCANDLESS': BILLIE, mid to late forties with dark striking eyes; WALT, a taciturn man, early fifties; and CARINE, eighteen, pretty with her mother's eyes and waist length brown hair, a gold crucifix dangles from her neck. They look around, looking for Chris, he's nowhere in INTERCUT: Chris, in a shower ( PHOTO-SONICS ) He TURNS INTO CAMERA, the water streaming down his face. From the announcement podium comes the name of their son and brother, CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON MCCANDLESS. The McCandless family increasingly panicked over Chris' absence, when almost magically, he appears in full cap and gown.
BILLIE: Here they are.
CHRIS: I say.Do what you are going to do, and I will tell about it.
CARINE: Who wrote that?
CHRIS: Well, it could've been either one of us, couldn't it?
CARINE: Thanks, big brother.
BILLIE: You scared the daylights out of me, jumping on to that stage, oh my god. Congratulations, son.
WALT: Congratulations, son.
CHRIS: I'm starving.
CHRIS: My grades are gonna be good enough, I think, to get into Harvard Law.
WALT: That's a big deal. What do you have left in your college fund?
CHRIS: It's an inheritance, dad. I've only been spending it as a college fund.Exactly twenty-four thousand five hundred dollars and sixty-eight cents.
BILLIE: That's very specific.
CHRIS: I had to go to the bank this morning.
WALT: Well, we'll certainly contribute the balance for Harvard.
CHRIS: Yeah. I've got to figure out what I'm going to do. I got a lot of things to pack and organize here first.
BILLIE: I'm so glad you're getting out of that place you're living. It was so much nicer when you lived on campus.
WALT: You'll come to Annandale before you disappear on us, won't you?
CHRIS: ( reluctantly ) Sure, I will.
BILLIE: You promise?
CHRIS: ( whining ) Well, your father and I want to make a present to you.
BILLIE: Well, your father and I want to make a present to you.
WALT: We want to get you out of that junker.
CHRIS: What's a junker?
WALT: Yes. We want to get you a new car.
CHRIS: ( appalled ) A new car? Why the hell would I want a new car? The Datsun runs great.
BILLIE: We weren't going to get you a Cadillac, Chris. Just a nice new car that's safe to drive. You don't know when that thing's just going to suddenly blow up.
CHRIS: Blow up? Blow up?! Are you guys crazy? It's a great car. I don't need a new car. I don't want a new car. I don't want anything. Thing, thing, thing.
WALT: Everything's gotta be difficult.
CHRIS: I said thank you. I just don't want
CARINE: I wouldn't say no to a new car.
CHRIS: ( mumbling a rib ) Ivana Trump McCandless.
CARINE: ( laughing it off ) Shut up, Chris. ( to her parents, seriously ) Seriously, I'll pay you back.
DAY: OVER Chris' shoulder, he frisbees his graduation cap from the upstairs window to his parents parting Cadillac on the street.
CHRIS: This is Emory University freshman Chris McCandless reporting from the vault at Thompson Hall.
OS STUDENT: What is this? Filmmaking 101?
CHRIS: ( with a Wizard of Oz tone ) Pay no attention to the voices behind the
CHRIS: Ted! We've got a monster in the vault. It represents all the corruption, the deceit, and greed within us all. I must slay it.
CHRIS: Ted! I know how to kill it. And I'm the only one who knows. You can't keep sending me on stories and expecting me to do nothing! I look like some kind of an Do you know who you're talking to? I'm Ted Turner.
PANICKED STUDENT: McCandless! You've got to hurry! The monster is scratching at the hatchway. He'll be out in no time.
CHRIS: ( to Ted ) That's it, Ted. Fire me if you want but this beast must be slayed.
CHRIS: ( singing ) Sign, sign. Everywhere a sign. Fuckin' up the scenery, breakin' my mind.
FOREST RANGER: U.S. Forestry. Could you step out of the tent please?
CHRIS: ( as he drops the knife to the Sorry. I thought you were a bear.
FOREST RANGER: ( approaching ) I don't blame you. You're less than a hundred yards from the nearest den. That's why I came over here to talk to you. Do you have some identification?
CHRIS: No. I'm sorry. My name's Alex. I've been travelling a lot and I got robbed and my identification was taken.
FOREST RANGER: You mind if I take a look in your tent?
CHRIS: Go ahead.
FOREST RANGER: You're not the character who knocked down our sign, are ya?
CHRIS: ( giggles ) Because there was a sign indicating that camping was allowed by permit only.
FOREST RANGER: Because there was a sign indicating that camping was allowed by permit only.
CHRIS: Well, I don't have a permit.
FOREST RANGER: No, I'm sure you don't. Listen, it looks like you've got your food secured pretty good, so I'm not gonna make you move on tonight. But, these bears out here are nursing young and you know how that goes. Next time, stop at the Rangers station and get yourself a permit.
CHRIS: Alright. I appreciate it. I'm gonna be headed towards the coast tomorrow.
FOREST RANGER: Be careful.
CHRIS: ( mocking imaginary Is that a man mommy? That's no mere man, sweetheart. That's Alexander SuperTramp! King of the wild
DRIVER: This is where I turn off.
CHRIS: Alright man. Thanks a lot.
POLICEMAN: How're you doin' this evening?
CHRIS: ( reluctantly ) I'm alright. What's the matter?
POLICEMAN: You wanna put your backpack down on the hood of my car.
CHRIS: Because I asked you to, sir.
POLICEMAN: Because I asked you to, sir.
CHRIS: But I haven't done anything wrong. These are my personal items.
POLICEMAN: Do you know that it's unlawful to hitchhike on this stretch of highway.
CHRIS: You're kidding.
POLICEMAN: Do you see a safe area for a vehicle to stop? We got a tree-lined highway without a substantial shoulder here. And we've had a lot of accidents on this road from people stopping in the traffic lane for hitchhikers.
CHRIS: Alright, but.I mean, you stopped your car. You're in the traffic lane. And you can see, there's hardly any cars out here. Plus, it's a straight road; you can see for a long ways.
POLICEMAN: May I see some identification?
CHRIS: I don't have any.
POLICEMAN: You don't have any identification?
CHRIS: ( a beat ) McCandless. Christopher Johnson
JAN: Hi. We just barely saw you there, under that crazy hat of yours. We couldn't back up - the van's reverse is broken.
CHRIS: ( as Jan fiddles with side Oh. That's okay. Thanks for stopping.
JAN: This door's a little tricky, I'll get it.
RAINEY: Hey, I'm Rainey.
JAN: And I'm Jan.
CHRIS: Hey, Rainey. Hi Jan. I'm Alex.
RAINEY: Alex of the hat.
CHRIS: ( closing the side door )
RAINEY: Were you out there a long time hitching?
CHRIS: Couple of days. But sometimes I forget to put my thumb out.
JAN: Probably, the rest of the time, that hat scares `em away.
CHRIS: ( excited ) See that? I've got this book and it shows you all the plants and berries that are edible. You can find things wherever you go.
RAINEY: We were just in town getting some beads and stuff. Jan does handicrafts, so we're usually going from one swap meet to another. She's so good at what she does, we sold everything. So, we set up camp at Orick Beach. You're welcome to camp there with us.
JAN: And eat there with us.
CHRIS: ( between large swallows ) So, I just left the car. It was a great car too. I'd driven it cross country the first time when I got out of high school. I had some really great adventures with it. That thing would just go and go. I mean, it was an `82 but if I'd kept it, it would've lasted me forever.
RAINEY: So, you're a leather now.
CHRIS: I'm a leather?
JAN: You're a leather tramp. That's what they call the ones that hoof it on foot. So, we're technically rubber tramps.
RAINEY: ( interjecting ) As we have a vee-hi-cle.
JAN: Alex could have a vehicle. If he didn't burn his money. Why would you want to do I don't need money. It makes people Well, you have to be a little cautious Alex. That book of yours is all well and fine but you can't depend entirely on leaves and berries.
CHRIS: I don't need money. It makes people Well, you have to be a little cautious Alex. That book of yours is all well and fine but you can't depend entirely on leaves and berries.
JAN: ( a little irritated ) Well, you have to be a little cautious Alex. That book of yours is all well and fine but you can't depend entirely on leaves and berries.
CHRIS: I don't know if you'd want to depend on much more than that.
JAN: Where's your mom and dad?
CHRIS: Makin' their money somewhere.
JAN: Come on Chris. You look like a loved kid. Be fair.
CHRIS: You know what I mean.
JAN: You know what I mean.
CHRIS: I'll paraphrase Thoreau "Rather than love, than money, than fairness, give me You look like shit. There's the truth.
RAINEY: You look like shit. There's the truth.
RAINEY: ( regarding Chris wrapped up Geez. If I struck a match to you, I'd have warmth and dinner at the same time.
CHRIS: Where's Jan going?
RAINEY: Well, my friend, all is not well on the hippie front. You're an industrious little fucker, aren't ya. Yeah, it's funny how things happen at particular times. I've loved that woman for a lot of years. But you know, she's got a.story. We've been going through this thing real quietly cause, well.So, after running into you last night, this thing we were going through quietly, she started talking about. You know what I mean?
CHRIS: I think so.
RAINEY: You think what?
CHRIS: I think she's probably quietly disconnecting. It doesn't feel right to her to be close to you if there's a hole of some kind somewhere else.
RAINEY: That's a helluva insight. Jesus!. You're not Jesus, are you? You gonna walk on that water and get her back for Actually, I'm a little afraid of water.
CHRIS: Actually, I'm a little afraid of water.
RAINEY: I'll carry. Shit-yes I'll carry.
RAINEY: I thought you guys might need a little
JAN: ( moving to Rainey ) That's not hot enough. Put your arms around me.
CHRIS: I'm going to go down the beach a ways and read a little bit. I'll bring the rest of that wood back before nightfall.
RAINEY: Alright. We might take a run into town to grab some food for tonight.
CHRIS: Sounds good.
JAN: You know what Alex ought to do, Rainey? He ought to come out to the Slabs this Oh yeah.
RAINEY: Oh yeah.
CHRIS: What is that? The Slabs?
RAINEY: It's down in Niland, California. You know where the Salton Sea is?
CHRIS: Near San Diego, yeah?
RAINEY: Well about 200 miles Northeast of there, but yeah. Niland's off the east shore of Salton. Wild place. The navy bulldozed and abandoned a base there. All that's left is a grid of concrete foundations. They're scattered over about a square mile or so.
JAN: When the weather turns cold across the rest of the country, people show up there by the thousands: snow birds.
RAINEY: Sundry vagabonds.
JAN: Sundry vagabonds.
JAN: Livin' on the cheap under the sun.
CHRIS: You sell your handcrafts there?
JAN: Oh yeah. And a lot of second-hand goods. There's a swap meet. The people are cool. There's even some kids running around sometimes. Most everyone there, if they're not avoiding the cold, are at least dodging the IRS.
RAINEY: Or the FBI. CIA! DDT!!!
JAN: It's good. You should check it out. If you come, I'll make a proper hat for you. Well, Alex. I'm gonna clean up and the old man and I are gonna get some rest. Looks like you got yourself a good bag Yeah.my mother made it from a kit.
CHRIS: Yeah.my mother made it from a kit.
JAN: You're wonderful. Don't make me worry about you.
JAN: He reminded me.
RAINEY: I know.
CARINE: The year Chris graduated high school he bought the Datsun, used. He wanted to drive it cross-country and visit our old neighborhood in California. The day before he left was my dad's birthday. Chris made a speech.
CHRIS: ( a little drunk, a little Dad, you and I have had our differences over the years.but on your birthday I want to tell you how grateful I am for all the things you've given me. And that you did it starting from nothing to working your way through college and busting your ass to support us kids. So, in return, I've been busting my ass a bit.at Domino's Pizza -
WALT: ( patting his son the back ) Would you look at that.
CARINE: Jesus, you must've had a lot to drink.
CHRIS: Too much and not enough. I used to believe all that stuff. That whole story. I thought maybe if I said it again, I'd believe it. But I don't.
CARINE: And that one lie had led to another. That two years after Chris was born, dad had had another son with Marcia. Worse yet was that it was Marcia to whom he was still legally married at the time. And it was Chris and I who were the bastard Dad's arrogance made him conveniently oblivious to the pain he caused. And mom, in the shame and embarrassment of a young mistress, became his accomplice.
CARINE: Dad's arrogance made him conveniently oblivious to the pain he caused. And mom, in the shame and embarrassment of a young mistress, became his accomplice.
WAYNE: ( rolling a cigarette without How're you doing? Wayne Westerberg.
CHRIS: ( shaking hands ) Hi Wayne. Alex McCandless.
WAYNE: Seems like every time I come on this road, there's somebody hitching out here who looks as skinny and unfed as you.
CHRIS: Oh, I wouldn't want to burden you.
WAYNE: How long has it been since you've had anything to eat?
CHRIS: Couple of days. I kinda ran out of Well, there's no choice about it. I'm gonna get you some dinner.

WAYNE: Yeah, I used to have a girlfriend who'd go there, camp on the Black Feet Res. She was into all that American Indian I can bring you to the border at Sweet Grass once you've had some food.
CHRIS: Well, that'd be great. What do you do out here?
WAYNE: Well, I do a lot of things. Computer programming. Video game repair. I'm a licensed pilot, own a grain elevator in Carthage and another one a few miles out of town. But in the summertime I run a combine crew, follow the harvest from Texas way the hell north to the Canadian border. We just got done cutting barley for Coors and Anheuser Busch. But then I got this little black box deal on the side ( You know what I mean? )
CHRIS: You mean those free satellite TV deals?

CHRIS: Dawn tomorrow, engines roaring. "Pot o Gold. Oh that pot o gold."
WAYNE: Dawn tomorrow, engines roaring. "Pot o Gold. Oh that pot o gold."
ALL: "Pot o Gold. Gotta get that pot o gold!"
CHRIS: ( raising his beer ) To Carthage.
WAYNE: Okay Kevin, get all the machines back to the elevator. I'm gonna show Chris to his room.
WAYNE: ( laughs ) First come, first serve buddy.
WAYNE: ( carrying Chris' pack for Come on up in here. This'll be your room for as long as you hang about.
WAYNE: Shower's down the hall. If you hurry you can beat the rest of the boys to it. But you do want to grab a shower cause we're all heading over to the Cabaret in exactly thirty-six minutes.

MAN #2: You go ahead, fairy. Just don't use all the soap.
WAYNE: Alex, this is Gail . This is the one to go to for that White Russian you've been wanting. Of course the quid pro quo can be hazardous.
GAIL: Shut up, Wayne. You want a White Russian, sweetie?

WAYNE: In the wild.
CHRIS: Yeah. Maybe write a book about my travels. About getting out of this sick Society, right.
WAYNE: ( coughing ) Society, right.
CHRIS: Because you know what I don't understand? I don't understand why, why people are so bad to each other, so often. It just doesn't make any sense to me. Judgement. Control. All that.
WAYNE: Who "people" we talking about?
CHRIS: You know, parents and hypocrites. Politicians and pricks.
WAYNE: ( tapping a long finger This is a mistake. It's a mistake to get too deep into that kind of stuff. Alex, you're a helluva young guy, but I promise you this: You're a young guy. Blood and fire! You're juggling blood and fire!

CHRIS: Yeah, maybe I ought to put off going to Alaska, at least so I can get settled up there in decent weather.
GAIL: South. You want to go south. You want me to take you out to the highway?

GREEN SUIT: Can I help you?
CHRIS: Yeah. If I wanted to paddle down the river, where's the best place to launch out of?
GREEN SUIT: "To launch out of?" What's your experience level?
CHRIS: Not much.
GREEN SUIT: Any? Do you have a permit?
CHRIS: A permit for what?
GREEN SUIT: You can't paddle down the river without a permit. If you like, you can apply for one here, get yourself some experience, and I'll put you on the wait-list.
CHRIS: Wait-list? To paddle down a river?
GREEN SUIT: That's right.
CHRIS: ( giggling ) Well, how long do you have to wait?
GREEN SUIT: I've got an opening May 2003.
CHRIS: ( laughing ) Twelve years?
GREEN SUIT: Well, you could always join a commercial raft trip and go with a licensed guide. They usually have a few last minute cancellations. I think it's about two- thousand dollars.
CHRIS: Thanks for your help.
CHRIS: ( to himself ) I'm Superman. SuperTramp.

CHRIS: ( interrupting ) Because that's crazy! You come down the rapids. What do you want on your hotdog? Mustard and relish?
MADS: ( interrupting ) Because that's crazy! You come down the rapids. What do you want on your hotdog? Mustard and relish?
CHRIS: You have ketchup?
MADS: No, I have mustard and relish.
CHRIS: Mustard and relish it is then.
MADS: Sonja, you want a hotdog?
SONJA: ( in Danish ) Of course I want a hotdog. Why are you
MADS: ( translating ) She asked me why I'm stupid. And I say, well.like I ask you why you're crazy and you say "well." Where are you going?
CHRIS: I haven't decided.
MADS: We like it here very much. We went to Los Angeles. And then, we went to Las Las Vegas is very nice. The universe is very good.
SONJA: Las Vegas is very nice. The universe is very good.

CHRIS: How far are we from Lake Mead?
MADS: Sonja, how far is Hoover Dam?
SONJA: Maybe three hundred thirty kilometers.like two hundred miles.
CHRIS: Man, I wonder if I could go all the way down into the Gulf of California.
MADS: ( entering the water with I go with you. We leave Sonja here. You and me in kayak - we go to Mexico.
SONJA: ( in Danish ) You're embarrassing. Idiot.
MADS: I like the meeting you.
CHRIS: Thank you. I'm very happy to meet both of you too.
MADS: He went thattaway! The crazy man - he went thattaway!
SONJA: Just like in the movies.
CARINE: But why he didn't send a letter, maybe through a friend. I got mad. But I told myself it was good. It made me remember that there was something more than rebellion, more than anger that was driving him. Chris had always been driven, had always been an adventurer. When he was four years old.
CARINE: .he once wandered six blocks away from home at three o'clock in the morning.
CARINE: He was found in a neighbor's kitchen, up on a chair, digging into their candy
CARINE: Whatever drawer he was opening now must have something sweet in it.

POV: Morelos Dam at the Mexican border.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER: 36 days, wow. I guess they're gonna have to watch that spillway a little better.
CHRIS: What they ought to do is open up the dams and let the rivers flow.
IMMIGRATION OFFICER: I can't disagree with you on that. Okay, Alexander SuperTramp. I think we're gonna let you out of here shortly but you've got two working weeks to get an ID card in the United States. You can't be crossing these borders without identification, are we understood?

CHRIS: 138 EXT. ARIZONA INTERSTATE UNDERPASS - NIGHT 138
CARINE: I close my eyes at night sometimes and imagine where Chris might be.
CARINE: Was there beauty around him? Was he hurt? Was he alone?
CARINE: Was he having the great adventure that he
CARINE: Could he feel the changes here at home? By some kind of supernatural osmosis? Chris once wrote to me from college saying he wanted to talk to me about all the problems he had with mom and dad.
CARINE: He said I was the only person in the world who could've possibly understood what he had to say.
CARINE: In those silent moments, with my eyes closed trying to picture where Chris might be at that very moment, probably climbing some scary mountain, I want to reach into that picture and bring him back to see what mom and dad, what our family might become.
CARINE: But instead when I open my eyes, what I see is my mother, sitting at the dining room table, sifting through photo albums and pictures of Chris. It's all she can do to examine the snapshots. And, though she breaks down from time to time, she studies them with a sort of hungry intensity - like looking at food you can't eat, or into a window at a family around a table that you were once a part of and can be no more.
CARINE: Instincts that seem to sense the threat of a loss so huge and irreparable that the mind balks at taking its measure - I begin to wonder if I do understand what Chris is saying any longer. But I catch myself in doubt and remember that these are not the parents he grew up with. That in the forced reflection that comes with loss, indeed everything Chris is saying, has to be said. And I trust for him that everything he is doing has to be done. This is our life.
TRUCKER: I don't know where to drop you. Bullhead's kinda haphazard - there's no "center." You sure you don't want to be in Laughlin? It's casinos versus Yeah, no. This is good. Right here.
CHRIS: Yeah, no. This is good. Right here.
TRUCKER: Alright then. Chiropractors it is.
LORI: Chris, you gotta go faster. We've got a line out the door.
CHRIS: ( a bit oblivious )
LORI: ( extending patience ) Chris, I don't mean to be on you about everything. You're doing a great job.
CHRIS: Right, right. I forgot.
LORI: And please. Hurry. We're ten deep.
CHRIS: But the pace remains.
CHRIS: How much do I have in the account now?
TELLER: It looks like.let me see. Including this latest deposit.One thousand, two hundred and fifty two dollars and.twenty-two cents.
CHRIS: What's the interest on twenty-two cents?
CHRIS: Lori, I'm punching out.
LORI: Okay. Just put it in the drop.
CHRIS: No, I mean I'm punching out for good.
LORI: ( happy for him ) We've made our quota, have we?
CHRIS: Yeah. Also, I've got to do some things before I head north.
LORI: Alright Chris. Well, we've enjoyed knowing you. I won't be able to get that last check to you right away though.
CHRIS: That's okay. I'll let you know where to send it.
LORI: Alright then Chris. Bye-bye now.
CHRIS: CUT TO:
JAN: Sunni! Come here boy.
CHRIS: ( overjoyed )
JAN: ( overjoyed )
JAN: You have to tell us everything.
CHRIS: ( blushing ) She's only a teenager.
JAN: Good luck.
RAINEY: How long can you stay with us?
CHRIS: Well, I'm waiting on a check from my last job to come into Salton City the day after Christmas. I've got to start thinking about getting ready for Alaska. When the sun gets a little lower tonight, I'm going to start a calisthenics routine. I think after the check comes in, I'll try to find some mountains I can climb everyday till spring comes. I gotta see how far the money's gonna go.
RAINEY: Well, you know, we'll give you a little something for every day you work the I'm not taking any money from you, Rainey. It's been a real great twist meeting you two. You look like you're doing good.
CHRIS: I'm not taking any money from you, Rainey. It's been a real great twist meeting you two. You look like you're doing good.
RAINEY: We are, and you were a big part of that, coming along when you did. Yep, things are good. Man, I used to think Tantric sex was just a bunch of reading. Speaking of which, don't you think you ought to introduce yourself to Joni Mitchell over there?
TRACY: You selling books?
CHRIS: You selling books?
TRACY: You selling books?
CHRIS: I am. We are.
TRACY: I read a lot.
CHRIS: Do you?
TRACY: That's good. I heard you play your song last night.
CHRIS: That's good. I heard you play your song last night.
TRACY: ( embarrassed ) I'm terrible.
CHRIS: You are not terrible.
TRACY: I'm not?
CHRIS: No. You sing sweet.
TRACY: Thank you. I was going to go watch the kids play in the mud. Do you want to go?
RAINEY: Go on. I'll watch the store.
CHRIS: I'm sorry. This is Rainey. And I'm
RAINEY: Hi. Rainey. And this is Alex. ( "Don't lie to her." )
TRACY: I'm Tracy.
JAN: I wasn't much older than Tracy when I got pregnant. And I thought my husband and I were going to invent peace on earth and stay together forever. But it didn't work out that way. He left. History. Now ancient history. And that was the end of that. So, I raised Reno by myself - that's my son. Then I met Rainey. And that was really good for a while. But Reno was already a teenager and was becoming a man in his own way. And then, I don't know. He kinda followed in his father's footsteps - out the door and gone. And I really don't know where he is. I haven't heard from him in two I hope I get to meet him sometime.
CHRIS: I hope I get to meet him sometime.
JAN: Do your folks know where you are? Soup's on. Oh, I'm sorry. Are you guys getting heavy?
TRACY: Soup's on. Oh, I'm sorry. Are you guys getting heavy?
JAN: No, sweetheart. Just hungry. You've been doing a fantastic job over there. Shall we eat?
CHRIS: Tracy grabs Chris' hand and proudly leads him to supper. As they exit frame, we remain for a moment with Jan and her thoughts.
RAINEY: I really ought to get myself doing that.
CHRIS: You should Rainey. Makes that Tantric stuff go even better.
RAINEY: How the hell would you know? That poor girl over there is about ready to vault onto a fence post. And here you are, the monk of Jack LaLane.
CHRIS: Me too.
RAINEY: For what?
CHRIS: Don't you think they ought to?
RAINEY: Don't you think they ought to?
CHRIS: They should. But I can't. Not yet, anyway. I got a sister though, Carine. She's the most beautiful girl in the world. But, it's all got to stay behind me until I get where I'm going.
RAINEY: Yeah, Rainey. Alaska.
CHRIS: Yeah, Rainey. Alaska.
CHRIS: Hello? Merry Christmas?
CHRIS: ( deer in headlights ) My parents went into town.
TRACY: My parents went into town.
CHRIS: Yes, they did. They went to call my grandma for Christmas.
TRACY: Yes, they did. They went to call my grandma for Christmas.
CHRIS: No, I mean, no, we can't do that.
TRACY: Why not?
CHRIS: How old are you?
TRACY: Chris throws her a look of doubt.
CHRIS: What year were you born?
CHRIS: You can always get in touch with me by sending mail here. I don't know when I'll get it, but I'll get it.
TRACY: ( crying ) You're pretty magic.
CHRIS: You're pretty magic.
TRACY: I am?
RAINEY: You take care of yourself, kiddo.
CHRIS: You too, Rainey. Thanks for everything.
JAN: ( sweetly ) Just get your pack out of the back and get out of here. I can't take a hug.
CARINE: He'd take them on what he loved to refer to as "epic" runs. The whole point was to run until they were completely lost and so exhausted that they were on the verge of puking. Then they'd slow down a little, somehow he'd find their bearings, and lead them home again at full speed. This was my brothers idea of fun.
CHRIS: ( no high-pitched pet voice ) Hey boy. You are a handsome fellow. ( over shoulder to the girl ) Beautiful dog.
THE GIRL: Thank you. Go on, boy. Go on.
CHRIS: Go on, boy. Go on.
RON: Where's your camp?
CHRIS: ( pointing ) Out past Oh-My-God Hot Springs.
RON: I've lived in and around here six years now and I've never heard of any place that goes by that name.
CHRIS: Alex. Where are you from Alex?
RON: Alex. Where are you from Alex?
CHRIS: West Virginia.
RON: Okay, Alex from West Virginia. I like a fellow who doesn't raise the pitch of his voice when he talks to animals.shows he doesn't condescend.
CHRIS: You go left here.
RON: You live here?
CHRIS: No, we keep going. I'm further up. Another half-mile or so, out on the
RON: Well, this is somethin' out here. Don't you worry about those dope smokers and nudists down below there?
CHRIS: No, they keep to themselves pretty much and so do I.
RON: ( skeptical ) Hmmm. You strike me as a bright young man. Am I wrong about that?
CHRIS: pretty good.
RON: been out here?
CHRIS: think you should be getting an education? And a job? And making something of this twentieth century invention and I don't want one. You don't need to worry about me. I have a college education. I'm not destitute. I'm living like this by Yeah, in the dirt.
RON: think you should be getting an education? And a job? And making something of this twentieth century invention and I don't want one. You don't need to worry about me. I have a college education. I'm not destitute. I'm living like this by Yeah, in the dirt.

RON: ( laughs ) Yeah, in the dirt.
CHRIS: ( laughs ) Yeah, in the dirt.
RON: Don't have one anymore.
CHRIS: Don't have one anymore.
RON: That's a shame.
CHRIS: Hey, Mr. Franz. I want to show you
RON: This is getting a little steep. And a little high for me kid.
CHRIS: Alright. But look out there. Even from half way out, it's quite a sight isn't
RON: You can see the Salton Sea from up there?
CHRIS: Yes, sir.
RON: ( starting his way down the My goodness.
CHRIS: You don't want to go up?
RON: Nope. I don't do these kind of things.
CHRIS: Yeah, sure. It'll take me a couple of minutes to clean up.
RON: Fair enough.
CHRIS: How old are you, Mr. Franz?
RON: Seventy-nine years old.
CHRIS: Seventy-nine.see, all due respect, but the real difference between people is the quality of their soul and not on how long they've trudged around like a dip-shit.
RON: It is. No question about that.
CHRIS: The government's the same as my parents. They don't respect anybody. Regulation. Regulation. Regulation. WE can't do this. But THEY can do that. I mean, the hypocrisy of the whole.culture. Makes me crazy. My father was having children with two women at the same time, and then has the gall to think that he can be of some guidance to me? Make judgments on me? My mother, of course, goes along with all of it. Keeps the secret, which of course, makes my whole life a fiction. Everything I thought was, wasn't. They're such fools! Fucking idiots!
RON: Alex, please don't lump me in amongst your judges. And your tyrants. But I'd prefer to not hear that kind of language.
CHRIS: ( realizing his slip ) Sorry. I don't usually use that kind of language either. I just get so angry thinking about it.
RON: You got a lot of passion, young man.
CHRIS: Awww, that was a great time Mr. Franz. Thank you.
RON: Look here. If Charles Manson and his buddies don't kill me on my way out of here, I'd like to cook you up a home cooked meal tomorrow night. If I come out here about, say, four o'clock tomorrow, how would that be?
CHRIS: That would be swell.
RON: Good, good. I'm no gourmet but I know where the spices are. Good night, kid.
CHRIS: Good night Mr. Franz.
RON: Did you find everything you need?
CHRIS: ( breaking his gaze from the Yeah. I hope I don't wreck your machine. There's a lot of grime in that stuff.
RON: Well, that's what it's for. How do these steaks look?
CHRIS: Well, sit down.
RON: Well, sit down.
CHRIS: You got a White Russian?
RON: Nope. Don't have any alcohol. I had to quit all that. How about a guava juice?
CHRIS: Nope. Don't have any alcohol. I had to quit all that. How about a guava juice?
RON: Nope. Don't have any alcohol. I had to quit all that. How about a guava juice?
CHRIS: I'll take a guava juice, that sounds
RON: Yeah, I had a little spell with the bottle, you could say.
RON: I spent most of my life in the army. On New Year's Eve 1957, I was stationed over in Okinawa. My wife and son were here in the States, just driving down the road when a fellow who'd had too much to drink plowed right into them. Killed them both. Anyway, you might think that the last thing in the world I'd do, is go to the whiskey, but at the time, it felt like the only thing I could do. And I did it hard. But pretty soon, I figured I wasn't doing my wife and son any good, mourning them with a bottle. So, I pulled myself together and quit drinking, cold turkey. And then.
CHRIS: Yeah, I was gonna ask you.
RON: Yeah, that's. Fuki, Kenjiro, Yoshiko, Keiko, Masaro, Junichi, Kimpei, Nayoko.
CHRIS: Do you ever travel, Mr. Franz?
RON: No. I can't seem to get too far from my leather. I'll show you after you finish eating. I do a lot of leather engraving. I got a little workshop in the garage. Between that and my pension, I do pretty well. But every time I think I might take a trip somewhere, I get too far behind on orders and such to consider it.
CHRIS: ( having wolfed down the Well, I'm finished eating. I'd love to see your workshop.
RON: Would ya?
CHRIS: Anything alive in it?
RON: What's the N stand for?
CHRIS: CUT TO:
RON: Chris summits.
CHRIS: ( yells down from above ) I could ask you the same question. Except I already know the answer.
RON: You do, do you?
CHRIS: I do, Mr. Franz. You've got to get back out in the world. Get out of that lonely house of yours, that little workshop, and go live on the road.
RON: Sittin' on my butt, huh?
CHRIS: Come on, old man! Come on!
RON: ( mumbling ) Ya little pinhead.
CHRIS: You alright?
RON: I'm going to miss you when you go.
CHRIS: I'll miss you too, Ron. But you're wrong if you think the joy of life comes principally from human relationships. God's placed it all around us. It's in everything. In anything we can experience. People just have to change the way they think about those things. You ought to put a little camper on the back of your pick-up and go take a look at some of the great work god's done out here in the American west.
RON: Alex.You're probably right. And I'm going to take stock of that.
CHRIS: Holy Shit!
RON: I told you about that language.
CHRIS: What are you doing up? It's three-thirty in the morning.
RON: Heard you get up off the couch half an hour ago, and had a funny feeling you might not be here for our breakfast.
CHRIS: Ron, you don't have to do that.
RON: I want to do it. Get you started on this thing of yours.
CHRIS: On my Great -
RON: ( interrupting ) I know. On your "Great Alaskan
CHRIS: Oh, just take it.
RON: Oh, just take it.
RON: Well my friend.
CHRIS: Both of them are uncomfortable. Chris goes for the door handle. Ron's gnarled hand reaches out to take Chris' After a long beat, Ron speaks without looking at Chris.
RON: I had an idea. You know my mother was an only child. So was my father. And I was their only child. Now, with my own boy gone, I'm the end of the line. When I'm gone, my family will be finished. What do you say, you let me adopt you. I could be, say, your grandfather.
CHRIS: How about we talk about this when I get back from Alaska, Ron. Would that be
RON: ( trying to mask. The Yep. We can do that, yep.
CHRIS: Thanks, Ron.
CHRIS: .and I will tell about it.
CHRIS: Well, it could've been either one of us. Couldn't it?
WALT: What is it?
BILLIE: I wasn't dreaming! I didn't imagine it! I heard his voice, Walt. I heard Chris.
