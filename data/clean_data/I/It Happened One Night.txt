STEWARD: Fine! Fine! She ought to like this.
GUARD: ( without moving )
STEWARD: Oh, no.
MULLISON: Not me, sir. She threw a ketchup bottle at me this morning.
STEWARD: Well, orders are orders! Somebody's gotta take it in.
FREDERICKS: Before I bring her another meal, I'll be put off the ship first.
STEWARD'S VOICE: The view moves over to a Frenchman.
HENRI: ( vehemently )
GUARD: ( impatiently )
LACEY: ( talking quicklystaccato )
STEWARD: These pigs! They're afraid to take her food in.
LACEY: That's ridiculous! Afraid of a mere ( he wheels on the steward )
STEWARD: ( more afraid than the othersstammering )
LACEY: ( shoving him aside )
LACEY: ( as he walksmuttering )
LACEY: Afraid of a mere girl! Ridiculous.
ANDREWS: ( murmuring to himself )
CAPTAIN: She hasn't had a thing yesterdayor Been sending her meals in regularly?
ANDREWS: Been sending her meals in regularly?
CAPTAIN: Yessir. She refuses them all.
ANDREWS: ( snappily )
CAPTAIN: It's not quite that simple.
ANDREWS: ( muttering )
CAPTAIN: This is dangerous business, Mr. Andrews. After all, kidnapping is no child's But Andrews ignores him and merely stares grimly forward. They arrive in front of the cabin door, where Lacey is brushing himself off, and where a couple of waiters are picking up the last pieces of the broken dishes.
ANDREWS: What's this! What's happened here?
LACEY: ( pathetically )
ANDREWS: Get another tray ready. Bring it here at once.
ELLIE: What do you want?
ANDREWS: What's this about not eating?
ELLIE: ( sitting )
ANDREWS: Know what my next move is? No more cigarettes.
ELLIE: Why don't you put me in chains?
ANDREWS: I might.
ELLIE: ( now seen at close range )
ANDREWS: ( tenderly )
ELLIE: ( moving away )
ANDREWS: ( still tender )
ELLIE: ( interrupting )
ANDREWS: ( joining in )
ELLIE: ( snappily )
ANDREWS: ( sharply )
ANDREWS: The door opens and several waiters parade in with trays of steaming food.
ELLIE: ( starting for them; threateningly )
ANDREWS: Wait a minute! Don't get excited! This isn't for you.
FIRST WAITER: Anything else, Monsieur?
ANDREWS: No. Everything seems quite satisfactory. I may want some more of that delicious gravy. I'll ring.
WAITER: Very good, Monsieur.
ANDREWS: ( making clucking noise )
ELLIE: ( disdainfully )
ANDREWS: ( chewing on a mouthful of food )
ELLIE: You can't tempt me.
ANDREWS: ( quietly )
ELLIE: I hope you're not comparing yourself to Napoleon. He was a strategist. Your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe.
ELLIE: ( muttering )
ELLIE: ( after a pausestrongly )
ANDREWS: ( carelessly )
ELLIE: ( aghast )
ANDREWS: We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
ELLIE: ( threateningly )
ANDREWS: ( buttering bread )
ELLIE: ( exasperated )
ANDREWS: I'll get it annulled.
ELLIE: You'll never do it! You can't do it!
ANDREWS: ( now seen close as he speaks between snatches of food )
ELLIE: ( seen with her father )
ANDREWS: Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.
ELLIE: You only met him once .
ANDREWS: That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
ELLIE: You talk as if he were a gigoloor something.
ANDREWS: ( risingreaching for ketchup )
ELLIE: ( seen closer now, with Andrews )
ANDREWS: You're going to finance him, I suppose.
ELLIE: Why not? Look what he's doing for aviation. It takes courage to do what he does. And character! At least he's accomplished something worthwhile. I suppose you'd like to have me marry a business man. Well, I hate business menparticularly if you're a shining example.
ELLIE: Your whole life is devoted to just one thing. To accumulate more money. At least there's romance in what he's doing.
ANDREWS: ( unequivocally )
ELLIE: ( strongly )
ELLIE: ( pleading sweetly )
ANDREWS: ( unimpressed )
ANDREWS' VOICE: ( carelessly )
ELLIE: ( hissing )
ANDREWS: ( again seen with her; calmly )
ELLIE: ( wildly )
ANDREWS: Please don't shout.
ELLIE: I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to.
ANDREWS: ( reaching for it )
ANDREWS: ( calling )
ANDREWS: It's my daughter! Go after her.
CAPTAIN: ( shouting )
ELLIE: ( to the fisherman )
A MAN: Sorry, sir. She got away.
ANDREWS: ( disappointed but proud )
CAPTAIN: What a hell cat. No controlling these modern girls.
ANDREWS: ( resentfully )
CAPTAIN: What about that diamond wrist watch she had onshe can raise some money on that?
ANDREWS: ( his face falling )
OFFICER: The view draws in to afford a close-up of ANDREWS staring out at the sea, his face wreathed in a broad smile; then this fades out.
FIRST DETECTIVE: We're wastin' our time. Can you picture Ellie Andrews ridin' on a bus?
SECOND DETECTIVE: I told the old man it was the bunk.
OLD LADY: Here's your ticket, ma'am.
ELLIE: Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.
OLD LADY: Oh, thank you. Thank you.
ELLIE: When does the bus leave?
OLD LADY: In about fifteen minutes.
ELLIE: Thank you.
SHORTY: Hey, what's going on here? I'd like to use that phone.
FIRST MAN: ( a reporter )
SHORTY: FIRST MAN There's a man biting a dog in there.
FIRST MAN: There's a man biting a dog in there.
SECOND MAN: ( drunker than the rest )
PETER'S VOICE: I'm not going to stand for this any longer. In a pig's eye, you will!
GROUP: Is that so? That's telling him, Petey old boy.
PETER: ( shouting into the phone )
GORDON: Say, listen, you wouldn't know a story if it reached up and kicked you in the ( listening )
PETER: ( again seen close at the phone )
GORDON: ( at the phone in the newspaper office )
PETER: ( in his phone booth )
GORDON: ( in his office )
SECRETARY: Mr. Gordon
GORDON: ( looking up )
SECRETARY: Did you know he reversed the charges on that call?
GORDON: ( into the phone )
PETER: ( into the dead phone )
MEN: Atta-boy, Peter. That's telling him, The gang is full of admiration for the courageous way he talked to the boss as Peter staggers out of the booth.
PETER: Give me any of his lip, will he? Huh! I guess he knows now what I think of his job!
FIRST MAN: Your chariot awaiteth withouteth, oh mighty King.
MEN: Make way for the King. Long live the King. Make way.
PETER: ( making a grand speech )
MEN: ( in the same spirit )
ANNOUNCER'S VOICE: All aboard. Philadelphia, New York. All aboard.
GROUP: Look out. Get back. Farewell. Farewell.
PETER: The scene cuts to the INTERIOR of the BUS as viewed from the front, the view moving forward, passing the conglomerate of unprepossessing human beings who occupy the seats. Every space is taken and the occupants seem hot and uncomfortable, which adds to their uninviting appearance. Mothers cling to crying babies. A Swedish farm hand and his young wife are already busy opening their basket of food prepared for the long journey. A surly-looking hoodlum traveling alone is slumped in his seat, his cap drawn carelessly over his eyes. The moving view passes these and other characters until it reaches one unoccupied seat in the car, unoccupied except for several bundles of newspapers.
PETER: ( calling )
DRIVER: ( annoyed )
PETER: ( pleasantly )
DRIVER: ( irritably )
PETER: ( looking at the back of the driver's neck for a moment, then confidentially )
PETER: Personally, I was raised on a bottle.
DRIVER: ( pugnaciously )
DRIVER: ( coming forward )
PETER: ( turning )
DRIVER: ( bellowing )
PETER: Ohthe papers
PETER: ( now seen close, with the Driver )
DRIVER: Hey, whadda you tryin' to dokid me?
PETER: Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
DRIVER: What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
PETER: ( turning to his suitcase )
DRIVER: ( pugnaciously )
PETER: ( turning back to him )
DRIVER: ( answering Peter; weakly )
PETER: Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
DRIVER: Oh, yeah?
PETER: ( exhausted )
PETER: ( now at close range, with Ellie )
ELLIE: ( eyes flashing )
PETER: Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you
ELLIE: ( ignoring himcalling )
ELLIE: Are those seats reserved?
DRIVER: ( pleased to discomfort Peter )
ELLIE: ( dismissing the whole thing )
PETER: ( also calling )
DRIVER: ? 224 ? These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
PETER: These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
DRIVER: ( hating to give in )
PETER: Move over, lady. This is a "maybe they He plops into the seat, the other passengers around them heaving a sigh of relief. Ellie flashes him a devastating look and deliberately turns her back on him. But Peter suddenly looks down toward the floor, following which a close-up AT THEIR FEET reveals that Ellie's bag on the floor annoys Peter. With his foot he slowly moves it over to her, and Ellie's foot is seen pushing it back, whereupon Peter viciously kicks it over to her side again. Next we see Ellie glaring at him, picking up her bag, and standing on the seat depositing it on the rack overhead. But just then the bus starts forward with a lurch which unbalances her, and she falls backward right in Peter's lap. Their noses almost touch. Their eyes meet, and they glare at each other hostilely. Ellie quickly scrambles off and gets back in her seat, turning her back on ( amused )
PETER: ( amused )
ELLIE: ( an order )
PETER: Are you talking to me?
ELLIE: Yes. Tell that man to drive slowly.
PETER: ( pleasantly )
DRIVER: ( sticking his head in to face the passengers )
PETER: He got away. I suddenly found myself in the middle of the brush and not a sign of the skunk.
ELLIE: I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not ( taken aback )
PETER: ( taken aback )
ELLIE: Oh, my heavens! It's gone!
PETER: ( sarcastically )
ELLIE: What happened?
PETER: That cadaverous-looking yegg[2] who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run!
ELLIE: What am I going to do now?
PETER: Don't tell me your ticket was in it?
ELLIE: ( opening her purse )
PETER: You can wire home for some money when we get to Jacksonville.
ELLIE: Why, noI
PETER: ( starting out )
ELLIE: ( quickly )
PETER: Don't be a fool. You lost your bag. The company'll make good. What's your I don't want it reported!
ELLIE: I don't want it reported!
PETER: Why, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything that
ELLIE: ( hotly )
PETER: ( mumbling )
DRIVER: ( murmuring )
ELLIE: Oh, I'm sorry
ELLIE: Everybody's gone.
ELLIE: ( realizing that he put it there )
PETER: ( nervously )
ELLIE: ( nervously )
PETER: I hated to wake you up.
ELLIE: No, thank you.
ELLIE: How much time have I?
DRIVER: About a half hour.
ELLIE: I'm going over to the Windsor Hotel.
DRIVER'S VOICE: The Windsor! You'll never make it in ELLIE'S VOICE You'll have to wait for me.
ELLIE'S VOICE: You'll have to wait for me.
DRIVER'S VOICE: ( aghast )
ELLIE: ( as she goes )
ELLIE: ( now next to the Guard )
GUARD: Left twenty minutes ago.
ELLIE: Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that busI told them to wait!
GUARD: Sorry, Miss. It's gone.
PETER: Good morning.
PETER: Remember me? I'm the fellow you slept on last night.
ELLIE: Seems to me I've already thanked you for that.
GUARD: ( turning )
ELLIE: Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
GUARD: Sorry, Miss.
PETER: ( sarcastically )
ELLIE: ( starting away )
PETER: ( quietly )
ELLIE: Don't tell me you did it on my account!
PETER: You're doing a pretty sloppy job of ( he reaches in his pocket )
ELLIE: ( surprised )
PETER: I found it on the seat.
ELLIE: ( taking it )
PETER: You'll never get away with it, Miss ( this is a shock to Ellie )
ELLIE: ( weakly )
PETER: Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
ELLIE: ( bluffing it through )
PETER: You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
ELLIE: You must have me confused with
PETER: ( interrupting )
PETER: ( while she reads )
ELLIE: ( looking up at him )
PETER: That's right. You didn't.
ELLIE: You're not going to notify my father, are you?
PETER: ( looking at her squarely )
ELLIE: If you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it.
PETER: I never thought of that.
ELLIE: ( frantically )
PETER: ( furious )
PETER: ( brusquely )
OPERATOR: ( recognizing him apparently, sarcastically )
PETER: ( impatiently )
OPERATOR: "How would you like to have the story, you big tub ofof"
PETER: Mush. Mush.
OPERATOR: "Tub of mush. Well try and get it. What I said about never writing another line for you still goes. Are you burning? Peter Warne." Well, that will be $2.60.
PETER: Send it collect.
OPERATOR: ( firmly )
ANNOUNCER'S VOICE: Bus for blah-blah-blah-blahCharlestonblah-blah-blahand all points North to New York!
DRUMMER: Hi, sisterAll alone? My name's Shapeley.
SHAPELEY'S VOICE: Ask any of the boys. They'll tell you. Shapeley sure knows how to pick 'em. Yessir. Shapeley's the name, and that's the way I like 'em.
SHAPELEY: You made no mistake sitting next to ( confidentially )
ELLIE: ( intending to freeze him )
SHAPELEY: That's pretty good . . . Well, shut my big nasty mouth!
SHAPELEY'S VOICE: . . . Looks like you're one up on me. Nothin' I like better than to meet a high-class mama that can snap 'em back at you. 'Cause the colder they are, the hotter they get, is what I always Now Ellie and Shapeley are seen together, with Peter seen in the background.
SHAPELEY: Take this last town I was in. I run into a damenot a bad looker, eitherbut boy, was she an iceberg! Every time I opened my kisser she pulls a ten strike on me. It sure looked like cold turkey for old man Shapeley. I sell office supplies, see? And this hotsy-totsy lays the damper on me quick. She don't need a thingand if she did she wouldn't buy it from a fresh mugg like me. Well, says I to myselfShapeley, you better go to work. You're up against a lulu. Well, I'm here to tell you, sister, I opened up a line of fast chatter that had that dame spinnin' like a Russian dancer. Before I got through she bought enough stuff to last the firm a year. And did she put on an act when I blew Ellie has scarcely listened to him, and has divided her attention between glancing back at Peter and staring at Shapeley as if he were insanenone of which bothers Shapeley. He goes on with his merry chatter, blowing rings of smoke in the direction of the ceiling.
SHAPELEY: Yessir. When a cold mama gets hotboy, how she sizzles! She kinda cramped my style, though. I didn't look at a dame for three towns.
SHAPELEY'S VOICE: ( continuing over this glimpse of her desperation )
SHAPELEY: But I don't go in for that kinda stuffmuch. I like to pick my fillies. Take you, for instance. You're my type. No kiddin' sister. I could go for you in a big way. "Fun-on-the-side Shapeley" they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me.
ELLIE: ( snappily )
SHAPELEY: ( laughing )
PETER: ( approaching them )
SHAPELEY: ( indicating his own seat )
PETER: ( indicating his own seat )
SHAPELEY: What's the idea?
PETER: I'd like to sit with myuhwifeif you don't mind.
SHAPELEY: ( puzzled )
PETER: Yeah. Come oncome on!
SHAPELEY: ( rising )
ELLIE: If you promise not to snap my head off, I'd like to thank you.
PETER: ( without turning )
BOY: Here you are, folks. Candypopcorncigarettesmagazines
ELLIE: Here, boy!
PETER: ( turning to her )
ELLIE: ( rummaging in her purse )
BOY: ( as he enters )
ELLIE: A box of chocolates, please.
PETER: ( to the boy )
BOY: ( puzzled )
ELLIE: Of course I do. What do you mean
PETER: ( to the boy )
ELLIE: ( resentfully )
PETER: A dollar sixty! . . . You had four dollars last night! How do you expect to get to New York at the rate you're going?
ELLIE: ( vehemently )
PETER: ( with finality )
ELLIE: Now, just a minuteyou can't
PETER: Shut up!
FIRST POLICEMAN: You won't be able to pass till morning.
SECOND POLICEMAN: Not even then, if this keeps up.
PETER: What's up?
FIRST POLICEMAN: Bridge washed outaround Dawson.
DRIVER: Looks like we can't go through till SECOND POLICEMAN ( his only contribution )
SECOND POLICEMAN: ( his only contribution )
FIRST POLICEMAN: Any of your passengers want a place to sleepthere's an auto camp up yonder a piece.
PETER: ( interested )
FIRST POLICEMAN: ( pointing )
PETER: FIRST POLICEMAN That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
FIRST POLICEMAN: That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
PETER: ? 239 ? He dashes toward the bus. Then he appears at the side door of the bus.
PETER: ( calling )
ELLIE: ( haughtily )
PETER: Yeah. Come onwe're stopping here for the night.
PETER: ( shouting )
DYKE: ( as they pass )
PETER'S VOICE: Well, Bratwhat do you say!
PETER: ( impatiently )
ELLIE: ( sarcastically )
PETER: ( seen close as he turns )
ELLIE: ( seen with Peter )
PETER: ( carelessly )
ELLIE: Oh, you did? What am I expected to doleap for joy?
PETER: I kind of half expected you to thank Your ego is colossal.
ELLIE: Your ego is colossal.
PETER: ( blithely )
ELLIE: ( appearing in a close-up, her face disdainful )
PETER'S VOICE: ( interrupting )
ELLIE: ( frightened )
PETER: Chalk up one for your side. Now listen, you want to get to King Westley, don't you? All right, I'm here to help you. What I want is your story, exclusive. A day-to-day account. All about your mad flight to happiness. I need that story. Just between you and me I've got to have it.
ELLIE: Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including This? Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate ( he goes back to the business of laying out his things )
PETER: This? Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate ( he goes back to the business of laying out his things )
ELLIE: ( starting to leave )
PETER: Oh, yeah? It's all right with me. Go on out in the storm, but I'm going to follow you, see? Yeah. And if you get tough I'll just have to turn you over to your old man right now. Savvy? Now that's my whole plot in a nutshell. A simple story for simple people. Now if you behave yourself, I'll see that you get to King Westley; if not, I'll just have to spill the beans to papa. Now which of these beds do you prefer? This one? All right.
ELLIE: ( sarcastically )
PETER: ( the previous scene returning )
PETER: Do you mind joining the Israelites?
ELLIE: You're not really serious about this, are you?
PETER: ( seen at close range, going about the job of undressing very diffidently )
PETER'S VOICE: I once knew a chap who kept his hat on until he was completely undressed.
PETER: Years later his secret came out. He wore a toupee.
PETER: I have an idiosyncrasy all my own. You'll notice my coat came firstthen the tiethen the shirtnow, according to Hoyle,[5] the pants should come next. But that's where I'm different.
I: ( unable to stand it any longer )
ELLIE: ( unable to stand it any longer )
PETER: Still with me, Brat?
ELLIE: You haven't got a trumpet by any chance, have you?
PETER: Not even a mouth organ.
PETER: ( humming to himself )
ELLIE: Do you mind putting out the light?
PETER: Not at all.
PETER: ( hoarsely )
ELLIE'S VOICE: Oh, excuse me.
ELLIE: ( seriously )
PETER: ( seen close; turning his head toward her )
ELLIE: ( both sides of the blanket coming into view )
PETER: Who, me? Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
ELLIE: ( interrupting )
PETER: Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
ELLIE: Peter Warne? I don't like it.
PETER: Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
ELLIE: ( flopping back on her pillow as she mumbles )
PETER: The pleasure is all mine.
PETER: I've been thinking about you.
ELLIE'S VOICE: You've had a pretty tough break at that. Twice a Missus and still unkissed.
PETER: You've had a pretty tough break at that. Twice a Missus and still unkissed.
PETER'S VOICE: ( meaningly )
ELLIE: ( hard )
PETER: He also turns his head toward the wall, and the scene fades out.
FIRST PILOT: ( shouting to other )
SECOND PILOT: ( who can't hear him )
FIRST PILOT: ( louder )
SECOND PILOT: ( nodding his head in agreement )
FIRST PILOT: ( cupping his mouth )
SECOND PILOT: ( nodding again, then leaning over )
SECRETARY: Here's another wire, sir. This one's from Charleston.
ANDREWS: Any others?
SECRETARY: ( holding up stack of wires )
ANDREWS: ( impatiently )
SECRETARY: They're practically all the same, sir.
ANDREWS: ( muttering )
SECRETARY: They're the finest detective agency in the country, sir.
PILOT: Yes, sir?
ANDREWS: ( seen in the cabin )
PILOT: ( yelling into phone )
ANDREWS: ( irascibly )
HENDERSON: I hope she's all right, sir.
ANDREWS: ( sharply )
HENDERSON: ( intimidated )
ANDREWS: Then shut up about it!
ELLIE: ( murmuring in her sleep )
PETER: Heyyou not up yet? Come oncome on!
ELLIE'S VOICE: What time is it?
PETER: Eight o'clock.
PETER: ( catching the package )
ELLIE: ( catching the package )
PETER: ( getting things ready for breakfast )
ELLIE: Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed?
PETER: Listen, BratI'm going to count to ten. If you're not out of bed by then I'm going to yank you out myself.
PETER'S VOICE: ( counting quickly )
ELLIE: ( panic-stricken )
PETER'S VOICE: ( screaming )
ELLIE: ( screaming )
PETER: You'll find the showersand thingsright back of the second cottage.
ELLIE: ( aghast )
PETER: Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
ELLIE: I can't go out like this.
PETER: Like what?
ELLIE: Like this. I have no robe.
PETER: Heretake mine.
PETER: But make it snappy.
ELLIE: ( dignifiedly )
PETER: ( appraisingly )
ELLIE: Where is the shower?
PETER: Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it.
ELLIE: ( leaving haughtily )
WOMAN: Can't a body have some privacy around The women who are waiting chuckle at Ellie's embarrassment as she stands aside. They certainly are making a monkey out of her decorum. The little girl keeps eyeing Ellie, fascinated.
LITTLE GIRL: ( pointing )
SHAPELEY: Hello, sister.
SHAPELEY: Sorry about last night. Didn't know you were married to that guy. Shoulda told me about it right off.
SHAPELEY: Hey, what's this? Wearing Papa's things? Now that's cute. That's what I call real lovey-dovey. Yessir.
ELLIE: ( stoppingher eyes blazing )
SHAPELEY: ( startled )
ELLIE: ( sharply )
SHAPELEY: Okay. I was just trying to make conversation.
PETER: ( without turning )
ELLIE: I met some very interesting women at the showers. We got to chatting about this and that. You know how time files.
ELLIE'S VOICE: We must come back to this place often. You meet the nicest people!
ELLIE: I saw the little Pussinfoos girl. She's turned out quite a charming creature.
ELLIE: Very outspoken, too. Said I looked funny. Wasn't that cute?
PETER: Hurry up and get dressed.
ELLIE: ( sticking her head over blanket )
PETER: If you didn't waste so much time on that wise-cracking drummerwe'd have been through with breakfast by this A close view shows ELLIE in the process of buttoning her dress. She looks up, having recognized a tinge of jealousy in his voice, which intrigues her. She starts to the other side of the blanket. Then we see her joining Peter in his part of the cabin.
ELLIE: Well, I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to.
PETER: I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime.
ELLIE: Thank you.
PETER: Egg. One eggdoughnutsblack coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
ELLIE: ( cheerily )
PETER: I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
ELLIE: ( "sweetly" )
PETER: ( gruffly )
ELLIE: Must be the Spring.
PETER: I thought maybeuh"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
ELLIE: He apologized for last night.
PETER: ( passing her a doughnut )
ELLIE: ( embarrassed )
PETER: ( easily )
ELLIE: Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!
PETER: It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
ELLIE: It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
PETER: Um. You're doing all right.
ELLIE: Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.
PETER: One consolation; you can never be lonesome.
ELLIE: It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. II did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?
PETER: Santa Claus?
ELLIE: KingKing Westley was in it.
PETER: Oh. Is that how you met him?
ELLIE: Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged.
PETER: Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
ELLIE: ( indignantly )
PETER: Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
ELLIE: Thanks, professor.
PETER: Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.
ELLIE: I'd change places with a plumber's daughter any day.
DYKE: ( protesting loudly )
FIRST DETECTIVE: Show him your credentials, Mac. I'll look around.
PETER: ( petrified )
ELLIE: ( petrified )
PETER: Don't look at me. I didn't marry King ? 255 ? Ellie runs around the room picking up her stuff and murmuring, "Oh, my goodness!" She reaches the window.
ELLIE: ( now seen close, at the window )
PETER'S VOICE: ( suddenly )
PETER: Sit down!
PETER: ( practically shouting )
ELLIE: ( a close-up showing her staring at him in bewilderment )
PETER: ( with his hand over her mouth )
PETER'S VOICE: She says she saw your sister Ethel the other day, and she's looking swell.
ELLIE: ( calling )
PETER'S VOICE: ( from behind blanket )
ELLIE: ( very sweet, calling to Peter )
PETER'S VOICE: ( appearing from behind the blankets; pleasantly )
DETECTIVE: ( who hasn't taken his eyes off Ellie )
ELLIE: ( innocently )
DETECTIVE: Yeah. What's your name?
PETER: ( stepping in front of him )
DETECTIVE: We're looking for somebody.
PETER: Well, look your head offbut don't come bustin' in here. This isn't a public While Peter has been speaking, the second detective and Dyke have entered. They walk over to Peter, the First Detective, and Ellie.
PETER: I got a good mind to sock you right in the nose.
FIRST DETECTIVE: Take it easy, son. Take it easy.
SECOND DETECTIVE: ( crowding forward )
DYKE: ( explains )
PETER: ( shouting )
ELLIE: ( appearing very domestic )
PETER: ( turning on her; very sarcastic )
ELLIE: ( sharply; entering into the spirit of the pretense )
PETER: ( mimicking her )
ELLIE: He didn't make a pass at me! I told you a million times!
PETER'S VOICE: ( screaming )
ELLIE'S VOICE: He didn't! You were drunk!
PETER: ( now seen with Ellie )
ELLIE: Well, you were!
PETER: I'm sorry I didn't take another sock at him.
ELLIE: Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested!
PETER: Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man! Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!
ELLIE: ( starting to cry )
DYKE: Now look what you've done!
FIRST DETECTIVE: ( apologetically )
SECOND DETECTIVE: We're looking for a girl by the name of Ellen Andrews. You knowthe daughter of the big Wall Street mug.
PETER: ( the entire group coming into view )
DYKE'S VOICE: I told you they were a perfectly nice married couple.
PETER: ( seriously )
PETER: Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain, haven't you?
ELLIE: You weren't so bad yourself.
PETER: We could start a two-person stock company. If things get toughwe can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]
ELLIE: Next week "East Lynne."
PETER: After that "The Three Musketeers."
ELLIE: How about Cinderellaor a real hot love No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
PETER: No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
ELLIE: ( fighting )
PETER: I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
ELLIE: You always want to run everything.
PETER: If you don't like it, you can resign from the company.
ELLIE: I refuse to resign!
PETER: Then I'll fire you. I'll do all the parts myself.
DYKE: Your bus leaves in five minutes.
PETER: Holy jumping! We haven't started to pack yet!
SECRETARY: Here's another wire from Peter Warne.
GORDON: Throw it in the basket.
GORDON: Don't accept any more.
SECRETARY: Don't accept any more.
GORDON: Don't accept any more.
ANDREWS: Three days! Three whole days! And what have you accomplished!
LOVINGTON: We can't do the impossible, Mr. Andrews.
ANDREWS: What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
LOVINGTON: I've put extra men on, all along the It's not enough!
ANDREWS: It's not enough!
LOVINGTON: No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know ? 261 ? ( who has been pressing several buttons on his desk )
ANDREWS: ( who has been pressing several buttons on his desk )
ANDREWS: ( seeing them )
CLARK: ( leaving )
ANDREWS: Send the story out to the newspapers.
BROWN: Send the story out to the newspapers.
ANDREWS: Send the story out to the newspapers.
BOY: ( in a trembling voice )
ELLIE: ( touching Peter's arm )
ELLIE: ( again seen with Peter; sympathetically )
PETER: Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old womana trip like this.
ELLIE: ( worried )
MAN: Hey, Galli-Curci,[9] come onget onto ( poking Peter )
ELLIE: ( sticking her head out )
PETER: ( singing )
BOY: ( with a moan )
PETER: ( consolingly )
BOY: ( crying )
PETER: Come on, son. Better give your mother a chance to snap out of it.
ELLIE: You'd better rest. It's been a hard trip, hasn't it?
BOY: We ain't ate nothin' since yestidday.
PETER: What happened to your money?
BOY: Ma spent it all for the tickets. She didn't know it was gonna be so much.
PETER: Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?
BOY: I was gonna do it, but Ma wouldn't let me. She was ashamed, I guess.
ELLIE: She'll be all right, soon's she gets something to eat.
ELLIE: Here, boyfirst town we come to, buy some food.
BOY: I shouldn't oughta take this. Ma'll be angry.
ELLIE: ( confidentially )
BOY: ( a sob in his voice )
PETER: Me? Forget it, son.
BOY: ( also smiling )
ELLIE: ( her arm around the boy )
DRIVER: That storm sure made a mess outa these ( appearing, and seeing the trouble )
PETER: ( appearing, and seeing the trouble )
DRIVER: Phone for help?
SHAPELEY: ( as Peter approaches )
PETER: Looks like we're going to be stuck for a long time.
SHAPELEY: ( calling to him )
SHAPELEY: Like to have a look at my paper?
SHAPELEY: Travelin' like this, you kinda lose track of what's goin' on in the world.
PETER: ( guardedly )
SHAPELEY: If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.
PETER: ( eyeing him expectantly )
SHAPELEY: ( pointing to paper )
PETER: ( non-committally )
SHAPELEY: It's a lotta dough. If I was to run across that dame, you know what I'd I'd go fifty-fifty with you .
PETER: I'd go fifty-fifty with you .
SHAPELEY: I'd go fifty-fifty with you .
PETER: ? 267 ? Cause I'm a guy that don't believe in hoggin' it, see? A bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight ball,[10] is what I always say.
SHAPELEY: Cause I'm a guy that don't believe in hoggin' it, see? A bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight ball,[10] is what I always say.
PETER: What's on your mind?
SHAPELEY: ( hard )
PETER: You're a pretty shrewd baby.
PETER: Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need.
SHAPELEY: ( smiling broadly )
PETER: I can use a smart guy like you.
SHAPELEY: ( expansively )
PETER: ( suddenly )
SHAPELEY: A gat! A gat!
PETER: A gat! A gat!
SHAPELEY: ( weakly )
PETER: ( carelessly )
PETER'S VOICE: ( with emphasis )
SHAPELEY: ( finally finding his voice )
PETER: ( seen with Shapeley; watching the latter to gauge the effect of his words )
SHAPELEY: ( shakily )
PETER: ( tough )
SHAPELEY: ( stammering )
PETER: What's the matter with you! Gettin' ( raising his voice, pleadingly )
SHAPELEY: ( raising his voice, pleadingly )
PETER: ( gripping his arm )
SHAPELEY: ( frightened out of his wits )
PETER: Yeah ?How do I know?
SHAPELEY: ( breaking down )
SHAPELEY: Oscar Shapeley.
PETER: Where do you live?
SHAPELEY: Orange, New Jersey.
PETER: Got a couple of kids, huh?
SHAPELEY: Yeah. Just babies.
PETER: You love them, don't you?
SHAPELEY: ( sensing the threat; horrified )
PETER: ( threateningly )
SHAPELEY: ( quickly )
PETER: If you don'tEver hear of Bugs Dooley?
SHAPELEY: Nice guy. Just like you. But he made a big mistake, one day. Got kind of talkative. Know what happened? His kid was found in the bottom of the
PETER: Nice guy. Just like you. But he made a big mistake, one day. Got kind of talkative. Know what happened? His kid was found in the bottom of the
SHAPELEY: Gee! That musta been terrible.
PETER: Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it.
SHAPELEY: ( grabbing Peter's hand and shaking it gratefully )
PETER: ( putting his hand away )
SHAPELEY: Sure. Anything you say.
ELLIE: Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that.
PETER: At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
ELLIE: Yes, I noticed he was getting a little fat lately.
PETER: What's the matter?
ELLIE: ( grimacing )
PETER: I don't trust that chatterbox.
PETER: First town we hit in the morning, you better wire your father.
ELLIE: Not as long as I'm alive.
PETER: Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation What do you meanstarvation?
ELLIE: What do you meanstarvation?
PETER: It takes money to buy food.
ELLIE: Why, haven't you?
PETER: ( interrupting )
ELLIE: You didn't give that boy all your money?
PETER: I didn't give him anything . You were the big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now?
ELLIE: Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.
PETER: ( risinguttering a deep sigh )
ELLIE: To New York?
PETER: I'm following you.
ELLIE: I'm following you.
PETER: Aren't you afraid of me?
ELLIE: ( confidently )
PETER: ( looking at her )
PETER: I wish you'd stop being playful.
ELLIE: ( thereupon holding the shoes out at a safe distance )
ELLIE: It's the first time I've ridden "piggy-back" in years.
PETER: This isn't "piggy-back."
ELLIE: Of course it is.
PETER: You're crazy.
ELLIE: ( after a silence for several seconds )
PETER: And he carried you like this, I suppose.
ELLIE: ( with finality )
PETER: ( with finality )
ELLIE: ( another silence before she speaks again )
PETER: I don't think there's a "piggy-back" rider in your whole family. I never knew a rich man yet who was a good "piggy-back" That's silly.
ELLIE: That's silly.
PETER: To be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxationa warm heartand a loving And rich people have none of those qualifications, I suppose.
ELLIE: And rich people have none of those qualifications, I suppose.
PETER: Not a one.
ELLIE: You're prejudiced.
PETER: Show me a good "piggy-back" rider and I'll show you somebody that's human. Take Abraham Lincoln, for instancea natural "piggy-backer."
PETER: Aw, nuts!
ELLIE: ( persistently )
PETER: Hold this a minute.
PETER: ( taking the suitcase )
PETER: ( to himself )
ELLIE: We're not going to sleep out here, are I don't know about you, but I'm going to give a fairly good imitation of it.
PETER: I don't know about you, but I'm going to give a fairly good imitation of it.
ELLIE: ( after a pause; coyly )
PETER: ( as a close view shows him still arranging her bed; grumbling )
ELLIE'S VOICE: I'm hungry.
PETER: ( without looking up )
ELLIE: ( seen at the rock, while Peter is out of sight )
PETER'S VOICE: You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
ELLIE: ( insisting )
PETER: ( as both he and Ellie are seen in their respective places )
ELLIE: ( argumentatively )
PETER: ( impatiently )
ELLIE: ( after a pause )
PETER: ( tearing his hair; screaming )
PETER: ( muttering while he works )
ELLIE: I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.
PETER: ( sharply )
ELLIE: ( shocked )
PETER: ( shouting )
ELLIE: ( seen close, as she is lying back on hay bed )
ELLIE: ( murmuring, frightened )
ELLIE: ( with a terrified outcry )
PETER: What's the matter?
ELLIE: ( relieved )
PETER: ( hoarsely )
ELLIE: ( clinging to him )
PETER: ( setting the watermelon down )
ELLIE: ( a sob still in her voice )
PETER: ( kicking the melon over to her )
ELLIE: I don't want it now.
PETER: ( vehemently )
ELLIE: I wasbut
PETER: But what!
ELLIE: I was so scaredthat it scared
PETER: ( exasperatedly )
PETER: Might get chilly later on.
PETER: You've had a lot of men crazy about you, haven't you?
PETER: I guess you've pretty much had your own way with them. That's your trouble mostly. You've always had your own way. That's why you're such a mess now.
PETER: ( suddenly )
PETER'S VOICE: Comical part of it is, it isn't what you want at all. In a couple of weeks you'll be looking for the nearest exit
ELLIE: Do you know?
PETER: ( flatly )
ELLIE: ( flatly )
PETER: ( flatly )
ELLIE: ( seen close )
PETER'S VOICE: I just want to be let alone, that's all. Life's swell if you don't try too hard. Most people want to get a strangle-hold on it. They're not living. They're just ( now appearing with her )
ELLIE: You sound like a hobo.
PETER: I am. I only work when I have to. Two years ago I got a notion and went to China. There was a war going on. Swell! After a while it got stale. I went down to Tahiti. Just lay on the beach for six months. What could be sweeter?
ELLIE: Doesn't sound very exciting.
PETER: I guess not. I'd have given odds it wouldn't mean anything to you.
ELLIE: What are you thinking about?
PETER: By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
ELLIE: ( pleased )
PETER: Yeah. I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy.
ELLIE: What'd you say we're supposed to be Well, you've given me a very good example of the hiking
PETER: Well, you've given me a very good example of the hiking
ELLIE: Well, you've given me a very good example of the hiking
PETER: ( amused at her )
ELLIE: If it's just the same to you, we'll sit right here till they come.
PETER: No. But I've got a penknife.
ELLIE: Hayin my teeth.
PETER: There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.
ELLIE: Needn't rub it in.
PETER: Uh-huh. Want one?
ELLIE: Uh-huh. Want one?
PETER: Uh-huh. Want one?
ELLIE: ( emphatically )
PETER: You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you.
ELLIE: I hate the horrid stuff.
PETER: I wish you wouldn't talk too much. We let a car get away.
ELLIE: What if nobody stops for us?
PETER: Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.
ELLIE: You're an expert, I suppose.
PETER: Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called the "Hitch-Hikers Hail."
ELLIE: There's no end to your accomplishments.
PETER: You think it's simple, huh?
ELLIE: ( exaggeratedly )
PETER: Well, it is simple. It's all in the thumb, see? A lot of people do it
ELLIE: Tch! Tch! I'm sorry for the poor things.
PETER: But the thumb always works. Different ways to do it, though. Depends on how you feel. For instance, number one is a short, jerky movement
ELLIE: Number two is a wider movementa smile goes with that onelike this.
PETER: Number two is a wider movementa smile goes with that onelike this.
ELLIE: You figured that all out yourself, huh?
PETER: Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're brokeand hungryand everything looks black. It's a long movement like this
ELLIE: Hm? Yeah, but it's no good if you haven't got a long face with it.
PETER: Hm? Yeah, but it's no good if you haven't got a long face with it.
ELLIE: ( excitedly )
PETER: ( alert )
ELLIE: ( sarcastically )
PETER: Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two.
ELLIE: When you get up to a hundred, wake me Another car is heard coming, and Peter steps forward, prepared to hail it. Then this dissolves to a long view of the ROAD as a stream of cars of every description speeds forward ( "toward the camera" ) and vanishes. The view moving in to the side of the road, Peter is seen still in the same spot. He waves his arms, jerks his thumb, indulges in all sorts of gyrations, while Ellie remains slumped on her rock, completely worn out.
PETER: I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.
ELLIE: Yes. But look at all the fun you had.
PETER: ( contemptuously )
ELLIE: You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a carand I won't use my thumb.
PETER: What're you going to do?
ELLIE: Mind your own business.
ELLIE: You might give me a little credit.
PETER: What for?
ELLIE: I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.
PETER: Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.
ELLIE: We don't need forty cars.
DANKER: So you've just been married, huh? Well, that's pretty good. If I was young, that's just the way I'd spend my honeymoonhitch-hiking. Y-e-s s-i-r!
DANKER: ( singing )
PETER: Hey, hey, aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?
DANKER: Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil?
PETER: ( giving up )
DANKER: ( completing his last line )
DANKER: How about a bite to eat?
ELLIE: ( quickly )
PETER: ( stopping her )
DANKER: ( sentimentally )
PETER: ( singing as he leaves them )
DANKER: ( singing as he leaves them )
PETER: What were you going to do? Gold dig him for a meal?[13]
ELLIE: ( defiantly )
PETER: Eat a carrot.
ELLIE: ( she starts out of car )
PETER: ( grabbing her arm )
PETER: Let's get out and stretch our legs.
PETER: He flings his coat at Ellie and dashes after the Ford. He is then seen running after it when the car turns around a bend in the road. Peter continues the pursuit. This scene wiping off, the FORD now makes its appearance around the bend, and as it approaches, Peter is seen at the wheel. He looks like he's just been through a fight. And as Peter rides in, Ellie comes running toward him.
ELLIE: ( a note of great relief in her voice )
PETER: Come onget in.
ELLIE: ( noticing a gash in his cheek )
PETER: ( impatiently )
ELLIE: ( as she runs )
PETER: ( as we see them closer )
ELLIE: What'd you give him for the car?
PETER: A black eye.
ELLIE: ( a little self-consciously )
PETER: ( tenderly )
ELLIE: ( with a cry of joy )
PETER: ( looking worried )
ANDREWS: I haven't changed my mind, Westley, I want you to understand that! I don't like you! I never have! I never will! That's clear enough, isn't it?
KING: You've made that quite evidentwith all your threats of annulment.
ANDREWS: ( hard )
WESTLEY: I might have been able to help if it weren't for you. I've been watched so closely, I
ANDREWS: ( impatiently )
WESTLEY: Why should she? After all
ANDREWS: ( interrupting )
WESTLEY: If you really mean it, I will.
ANDREWS: ( strongly )
ANDREWS: Come in, boys. This is myuhthis is King Westley.
REPORTERS: Hello, Westley . . . How do you do.
PETER'S VOICE: All right, Brat.
ELLIE: ( as she scrambles out of the car just as Peter comes up to her )
PETER: Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
ELLIE: What about money?
PETER: Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
ELLIE: That's swell!
PETER: I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
ELLIE: I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
PETER: ( after a pause )
WIFE: There you gotrustin' people again. How many times did I tell you
OWNER: He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.
WIFE: Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
OWNER: Said he was gonna stay a week.
WIFE: Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
OWNER: Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
WIFE: ( unconvinced )
PETER: ( without looking up )
PETER: ( strangely )
ELLIE: ( in a still, small voice )
PETER: ( dryly )
ELLIE: Is that the Walls of Jericho going up?
PETER'S VOICE: Yep! The Walls of Jericho.
PETER: ( then reaching for blanket )
ELLIE: Thank you.
ELLIE: ( suddenly )
PETER: ( laconically )
ELLIE: Why not?
PETER: I don't make it a policy to run around with married women.
ELLIE: No harm in your coming to see us.
PETER'S VOICE: Not interested.
ELLIE: ( weakly )
PETER: What do you want to see me for? I've served my purpose. I brought you back to King Westley, didn't I?
ELLIE: Peter, have you ever been in love?
PETER: I probably did the world a great favor at that. Got two pinheads out of circulation.
ELLIE: Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love?
PETER: ? 292 ? Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
ELLIE: Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
PETER: ( disdainfully )
PETER: ( seen close )
PETER'S VOICE: Certainly I've been thinking about it. Boy, if I could ever find a girl who's hungry for those things
PETER: I'm going to Swim in the surf with herI'm going to reach up and grab stars for herI'm going to laugh with herand cry with her. I'm going to kiss her wet lipsand
ELLIE: ( fervently )
PETER: ( after a long pause; hoarsely )
ELLIE: ( simply )
PETER: ( arguing with himself )
ELLIE: ( tensely )
PETER: ( scarcely audible )
ELLIE: ( whispering )
PETER: ( softly calling )
PETER: All I'm asking is enough gas to get me to New York. The bag's worth twenty-five ( hesitatingly )
MAN: ( hesitatingly )
PETER: ( "high-pressuring" him )
MAN: ( looking at Peter's hat )
PETER: I ain't got a hat.
MAN: I ain't got a hat.
PETER: ( promptly putting it on his head )
PETER: Fine! That's fine, Tony. Now get me a drink and make sure nobody disturbs me for half an hour.
ITALIAN: ( going out )
PETER: ( rumpling her hair )
AGNES: Better not go in. He'll shoot you on ( entering )
PETER: ( entering )
GORDON: ( rising to his full height menacingly )
PETER: ( advancing )
GORDON: ( quietly )
PETER: Joe, listen
GORDON: Don't "Joe" me.
PETER: Okay, Joe. Listenyou know I've always liked you. Anytime I could do you a great turnanytime I ran into a story that looked goodI always came running to you, didn't I? Well, I got one now. Those wires I sent you were on the level. It's the biggest scoop of the year. I'm giving it to you, Joe.
GORDON: You mean about the Andrews' kid?
PETER: That's it.
GORDON: A thousand dollars!
PETER: Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollarsand I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
GORDON: ( softening )
PETER: To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
GORDON: Never mind . . . Listensuppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
PETER: Never mind . . . Listensuppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
GORDON: That she's going to marry somebody else.
PETER: That she's going to marry somebody else.
GORDON: You're drunk.
PETER: Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
GORDON: If it's on the level.
PETER: Well, I got it, Joe.
GORDON: Who's she gonna marry?
PETER: ( taking out the story from his pocket )
GORDON: ( skeptically )
PETER: Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
GORDON: I'd put you there myself.
PETER: Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
GORDON: Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
PETER: I am, Joe.
GORDON: ( his eyes widening )
PETER: Now I know you're drunk.
GORDON: Now I know you're drunk.
PETER: ( running after Gordon as the latter starts out )
PETER: I met her on a bus coming from Miami. Been with her every minute.
GORDON: Well, I'll be
PETER: Listen, Palyou've got to get this money for me. Now. Minutes count. She's waiting for me in an auto camp outside of Philadelphia. I've got to get right back. You see, she doesn't know I'm gone.
GORDON: What a story!
WIFE: I told you! I told you, you couldn't trust him! He's gone!
OWNER: That feller last night, that's who! He was gonna stay a week, huh? Well, he's skipped. Took the car with him, too. We wouldn't have known a thing about it until morning if I hadn't took that magnesia.
WIFE: That feller last night, that's who! He was gonna stay a week, huh? Well, he's skipped. Took the car with him, too. We wouldn't have known a thing about it until morning if I hadn't took that magnesia.
WIFE: See that. They're gone!
OWNER: ( timidly )
WIFE: ( full of fightglaring at Ellie )
ELLIE: ( in a close view at Ellie's Bed as the owner and his wife come up to her; timidlysitting up )
WIFE: Where's your husband, young lady
ELLIE: Yesif he is your husband.
WIFE: Yesif he is your husband.
ELLIE: Isn't he here?
WIFE: No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
ELLIE: ( bewildered )
WIFE: Yeah? What makes you think so! He took his suitcase and everything.
WIFE'S VOICE: . . . could tell she was a hussy just from the looks of her.
OWNER'S VOICE: Hey! You! Got any money?
ELLIE: ( snapping out of her trance )
WIFE: ( the three now seen together )
OWNER: Yeah, you'll have to git .
ELLIE: Why, you can't put me out in the middle of the
WIFE: Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp.
ELLIE: But can't you wait until morning
WIFE: Ain't gonna wait a minute.
OWNER: Not a minute!
WIFE: Better start gettin' into your clothes.
OWNER: ( glaring at him )
WIFE: ( glaring at him )
OWNER: ( disappointed )
ELLIE: Can I use your telephone? I want to talk to New York.
WIFE: You ain't gonna stick me for no phone calls. You can go down to the Sheriff's The scene thereupon cuts to the EXTERIOR of the AUTO CABIN as Ellie emerges, the Wife standing in the doorway. In the foreground several people are scattered around the courtyard. One woman washes stockings under a pump. A man is changing the tire on his car. Ellie comes down the steps and crosses the courtyard.
WIFE: ( shouting to her )
PETER: Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.
GORDON: ( waving the story )
GORDON: S'long, kid. And good luck.
PETER: 'Bye, Agnes. You're beautiful. All women are beautiful!
GORDON: Oh, boy! What a yarn! What a yarn!
SECRETARY'S VOICE: There's Hank.
GORDON: ( grabbing phone )
GORDON: ( into the second phone )
GORDON: What!Ellen Andrews! You're crazy!
REPORTER: Yeah. She just phoned her father from an auto camp to come and get her. He's getting a police escort. Westley's going along, too. She's been traveling by bus. The moment she read that her father and Westley made up, she phoned in.
GORDON: You sure that's right! Say, you haven't been drinking, have you! Okaygrab a carand stay with them.
AGNES: ( starting out )
MEN: You want us?
GORDON: ( wheeling around )
MEN: ( leaving )
HENDERSON: I knew she was safe.
LOVINGTON: ( sighing )
ANDREWS: ( anxiously )
PETER: ( singing )
PETER: ( waving his handto the meadowlark )
PETER: ( to his Ford )
PETER: ( seen close; to the carwith exaggerated dramatics )
REPORTERS: Will you make a statement Miss Andrews? Was it an exciting experience? How did you travel?
ANDREWS: ( brushing them aside )
PETER: Take it easy, Dobbin. Remember your blood pressure.
PETER: Better get that toy train out of here. I'm in a hurry.

The place is alive with activity, and copies of newspapers are lying around, bearing headlines relating to the Andrews story.

The place is alive with activity, and copies of newspapers are lying around, bearing headlines relating to the Andrews story. Peter, a bewildered, stunned expression on his face, enters and crosses funereally toward Gordon's office. Several people standing around look up.
PEOPLE: Hi, PeteDidya see this? Ellen Andrews is back. Gonna marry that Westley guy after allWhat a dame! What a dame!
AGNES: Gordon's out back some place.
PETER: See that he gets that, will you, Agnes? Tell him I was just kidding.
GORDON: You can't get a thing done around her Peter Warne was just in.
AGNES: Peter Warne was just in.
GORDON: Huh? What?
AGNES: Left this money. Said to tell you he was just kidding.
GORDON: ( looking at the money )
GORDON'S VOICE: Hey, Pete!
PETER: Hello, Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought I'd have some fun with ( understanding )
GORDON: ( understanding )
PETER: Wouldn't have made a bad story, would Great! But that's the way things go. You think you got a swell yarnthen something comes alongmesses up the finishand there you are.
GORDON: Great! But that's the way things go. You think you got a swell yarnthen something comes alongmesses up the finishand there you are.
PETER: ( smiling wryly )
GORDON: ( slipping a bill in his coat pocket )
PETER: ( a whisper )
ANDREWS: Well, here we are; it's all set. You're finally going to be married properly.
KING: Why; naturally, I
ANDREWS: ( drily )
KING: You talk as if
ANDREWS: Someday perhaps, you might even take A close view of ANDREWS shows him looking around his study despairingly.
ANDREWS: ( murmuring )
KING'S VOICE: ( confidently )
ANDREWS: I hope so. However, that'll take care of itself.
KING'S VOICE: What's that?
ANDREWS: My daughter.
KING: ( the two now seen again; lightly )
ANDREWS: No? Say, listenI've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministerssome of the most powerful people in the worldbut I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.
KING: What would you like to have me do?
ANDREWS: Sock her!
ANDREWS' VOICE: Sock her at least once a day. Do it on general principles. Make her know you're the boss and never let her forget it. Think you can do that?
KING: It's quite an assignment
ANDREWS: Try. Do me a favor. Try. It's your only chance. And hers, too. Do that for meand maybe we'll be friends
KING: ( taking his handrising )
ANDREWS: ( dismissing him )
KING: Oh, by the way, Mr Andrews, I thought of a great stunt for the reception.
ANDREWS: You thought that up all by yourself, ( unabashed )
KING: ( unabashed )
ANDREWS: ( hard )
KING: Oh, no. She'll be crazy about it. Well, see you later. I'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space.
ANDREWS: We've done that already.
KING: ( smiling )
ANDREWS: Autogyro! I hope he breaks his leg.
ANDREWS: Yes, sir?
MARY: Yes, sir?
ANDREWS: How is she?
MARY: ( hesitantly )
ANDREWS: What's the matter? Anything wrong?
MARY: Oh, no, sir. No different than
ANDREWS: Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
MARY: Yessir. If you'll excuse me, sirshe sent me for a drink.
ANDREWS: ( after a pause )
ELLIE: ( jumping up with a start )
ANDREWS: ( a close view as he goes over to her )
ELLIE: Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming.
ANDREWS: ( with forced lightness )
ELLIE: ( in a faraway voice )
ANDREWS: Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
ELLIE: Oh, yes. I heard.
ANDREWS: ( noting her listlessness )
ANDREWS' VOICE: ( he goes over the Ellie )
ELLIE: ( turning and looking at him blankly )
ANDREWS: ( tenderly )
ELLIE: ( she walks over to table and crushes her cigarette )
ANDREWS: You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'mI'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questionsI
ELLIE: ( too quickly )
ANDREWS: If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scareIwhen I couldn't find you.
ELLIE: ( her hand on his arm )
ANDREWS: ( tenderly )
ANDREWS: ( after a pause, hoarsely )
ANDREWS: What is it, darling?
ANDREWS: ( looking into her eyes )
ANDREWS: I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious.
ELLIE: On the road.
ANDREWS: ( trying to cheer her )
ELLIE: ( smiling )
ANDREWS: Who is he?
ELLIE: I don't know very much about him.
ANDREWS: ( the great executive )
ELLIE: ( quickly )
ANDREWS: Oh, come now
ELLIE: He despises everything I stand for. He thinks I'm spoiled and pampered, and selfish, and thoroughly insincere.
ANDREWS: He doesn't think so much of you either.
ELLIE: He doesn't think so much of you either.
ANDREWS: ( his eyes widening )
ELLIE: He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me ( smiling )
ANDREWS: ( smiling )
ELLIE: ( whispering )
ANDREWS: Well, what are we going to do about it? Where is he?
ELLIE: ( sadly )
ANDREWS: I'd like to have a talk with him.
ELLIE: It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him.
ANDREWS: Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing No, I'll go through with it.
ELLIE: No, I'll go through with it.
ANDREWS: But that's silly, child. Seeing how you feel, why
ELLIE: It doesn't matter.
ELLIE'S VOICE: I've got to settle down. It really doesn't matter howor whereor with whom.
ANDREWS: ( seriouslyimpressed )
ELLIE: ( seen with Andrews; sighing )
ANDREWS: Is that his name?
ELLIE: Yes. Peter Warne.
ANDREWS: Peter Warne!
ELLIE: ( noticing this )
ANDREWS: ( evasively )
ELLIE: ( suddenly anxious )
ANDREWS: ( obviously guilty )
ELLIE: Oh, please, Dad
ELLIE: ( her voice strident )
ANDREWS: ( taking the note from her )
ELLIE: Are you going to see him?
ANDREWS: I suppose so.
ELLIE: ( hard )
ELLIE: Thanks, Mary. That's just what I need.
MARY: Mr. King Westley is on his way up.
ELLIE: FineFine! Have him come in.
ANDREWS: ( mumbling )
ELLIE: ( upon seeing him )
KING: How are you, Ellie?
ELLIE: ( releasing herself )
KING: You bet we did.
ELLIE: It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement, King. We'll never let up, will we? Never a dull moment. We'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off. Promise you'll never let me get off? It's the only way to live, isn't it? No time to think. We don't want to stop to think, do we? Just want to keep going.
KING: Whatever you say, darling.
ELLIE: I heard about your stunt. That's swell, King. Just think of itthe groom lands on the lawn with a plane. It's a perfect beginning for the life we're going to lead. It sets just the right tempo.

PETER: ( into the phone )
ANDREWS: I leave for Washington tonight. May be gone several weeks. Thought perhaps you'd like to get this thing settled.
PETER: Yeah, but I don't like the idea of walking in on your jamboree . . . Just between you and methose things give me a stiff ( seen in his office )
ANDREWS: ( seen in his office )
PETER: ( at his phone )

CAPTAIN: I want everything to be just so. When the ceremony starts, you stand on the sidestill . No moving aroundno talking, comprenez ?
PETER: ( blithely, as he passes them )
ANDREWS: Show him in.
ANDREWS: Mr. Warne?
PETER: Come in. Sit down.
ANDREWS: Come in. Sit down.
ANDREWS: ( seen close with Peter; after a pause )
PETER: That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.
ANDREWS: Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.
PETER: ( bitterly )
ANDREWS: ( shrugging )
PETER: ( seen close now )
PETER: ( now seen closer with Andrews )
ANDREWS: And this is what you wantthirty-nine dollars and sixty cents?
PETER: Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
ANDREWS: Yes, I knowbut
PETER: What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
ANDREWS: Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
PETER: What ten thousand?
ANDREWS: The reward.
PETER: ( sharply )
ANDREWS: ( smiling )
PETER: ( impatiently )
ANDREWS: You're a peculiar chap.
PETER: ( irritably )
ANDREWS: The average man would go after the reward. All you seem to
PETER: Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.
ANDREWS: You were taken for a buggy ride?
PETER: Yeahwith all the trimmings. Now, how about the check. Do I get it?
ANDREWS: ( smiling )
ANDREWS: Here you are.
PETER: ( evasively, while folding the check )
ANDREWS: That's an evasion.
PETER: ( putting the check into a wallet )
PETER: If you had half the brains you're supposed to have, you'd have done it yourselflong ? 321 ? Do you love her?
ANDREWS: Do you love her?
PETER: ( going for his hat as he replies )
ANDREWS: I asked you a question. Do you love ( snapping it out )
PETER: ( snapping it out )
PETER: ( looking her over contemptuously )
ELLIE: ( icily )
PETER: You bet I did.
ELLIE: Same to you.
PETER: Same to you.
ELLIE: Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
PETER: I would. But I've got a weak stomach.
GUESTS: Here comes King! He's just coming down! Hurry up, everybody! Come on, Ellie!
ANDREWS: I just had a long talk with him.
ELLEN: ( her voice breaking )
ANDREWS: Now, wait a minute, Ellie
ELLIE: ( sharply )
ANDREWS: ( whispering out of the side of his mouth )
ANDREWS: That guy Warne is O.K. He didn't want the reward.
ANDREWS: All he asked for was thirty-nine dollars and sixty cents . . . that's what he spent on you. It was a matter of principle with himsays you took him for a ride.
SECOND GIRL: Yes. She certainly is lucky.
ANDREWS: He loves you, Ellie. Told me so.
ANDREWS: You don't want to be married to a mug like Westley.
ANDREWS: I can buy him off for a pot of gold, and you can make an old man happy, and you wouldn't do so bad for yourself. If you change your mind, your car's waiting at the back gate.
MINISTER: ( starting the ceremony )
KING: I will.
MINISTER: Ellen, wilt thou have this man to be thy wedded husband so long as ye both shall live?
KING: ( calling after her )
