MARTIN: Come here you little sexpot!
MARTIN: His voice echoes through the giant trees. But his cries are interrupted by another sound.a Tarzan-like howl. MARTIN spins around. Strange creatures are swinging on vines through the giant trees. They are all around him. They look like HANDS. with little heads and arms where the wrists should be. They are all howling and jabbering. From behind, a HAND CREATURE swings down and grabs MARTIN by the collar, hoisting him high into the air. Clearing the trees, MARTIN sees he is not alone. There are many other people - all in the clutches of HAND CREATURES swinging on "vines".

ANTON: You won't regret it!
FEMALE FRIEND: Go for it Sal!
SALLY: ( indicating friend ) Only if she comes with me.
FEMALE FRIEND: ( enthusiastic ) Now you're talking!
ANTON: N-not at the same time!
SALLY: I'm not going on my own.
ANTON: Your imagination is a very special place. Doctor Parnassus will make it flower.
SALLY: I bet he will.
FEMALE FRIEND: We'll do it together.
ANTON: ( shakes his head ) No. T-two c-competing imaginations in the Imaginarium at the same time. it's n-not advisable.
FEMALE FRIEND: The stronger imagination will overcome the weaker and then there's n-no knowing what might That's really stupid.
ANTON: The stronger imagination will overcome the weaker and then there's n-no knowing what might That's really stupid.
FEMALE FRIEND: That's really stupid.
SALLY: Let go!
ANTON: D-don't be afraid, d-dear lady. You'll be safe with me.
SALLY: Put me down!
ANTON: Have no fear.
FEMALE FRIEND: She doesn't want to do it on her Only b-because she d-doesn't Let go of her you silly pillock!

ANTON: It's alright! It's alright!
FEMALE FRIEND: SALLY! They've got her in there! That's her screaming! SAL! They doing something to her! SALLY! Help, somebody! Help! Save her!
VALENTINA: Father! Father!
TONY: Please. Everything's alright. It's okay. Really. I promise you.
VALENTINA: What were you thinking? Look what you've done. Get out of the way!
PERCY: Better luck next time.
DOCTOR PARNASSUS: ( babbling ) This is my punishment. All is lost. First to Five. One down. Impossible, Valentina. First to five. One down. No people. No time, Valentina. We are doomed.
VALENTINA: ( very concerned ) Ssshhhh. Thanks, Tony. Leave us.
PERCY: Do me a favour. Take a long walk off a short pier.
TONY: Can I help?
PERCY: Bugger off!
ANTON: L-leave me alone.
TONY: What were you doing to that girl behind the mirror?
ANTON: ( incensed ) What are you suggesting?
TONY: Oh, c'mon.we all heard her I was screaming as well. It was t- Terrifying? Why? I don't No, well.you wouldn't. You've n- never been inside the D-Doctor's mind have you?
ANTON: I was screaming as well. It was t- Terrifying? Why? I don't No, well.you wouldn't. You've n- never been inside the D-Doctor's mind have you?
TONY: Terrifying? Why? I don't No, well.you wouldn't. You've n- never been inside the D-Doctor's mind have you?
ANTON: ( reluctantly ) No, well.you wouldn't. You've n- never been inside the D-Doctor's mind have you?
TONY: Your not trying to tell me that mind control stuff is real?
ANTON: You think it's some k-kind of scam, d-don't you?
TONY: Isn't it?
ANTON: No. But I d-don't expect you to g- get it. N-not in a million years.
TONY: Hang on.. if he can really control people's minds, why isn't he ruling the world? Why bother with this crappy side show?
ANTON: He d-doesn't want to rule the world d-does he?. He wants the world to rule itself!
TONY: What a waste. Tell me about the mirror. What's the point of that, if not to razzle-dazzle the public?
ANTON: ( smiles sardonically ) You're way off the mark. ( taking a swig ) It's a b-bloody great mystery. wrapped in a b-brown p-paper b-bag enema.or do I mean, enigma.
TONY: Er. one more thing..Does `first to five' mean anything to you?
ANTON: I thought you were the c-clever
VALENTINA: Thank God it's only cuts and bruises. I thought we'd lost you.
TONY: If you hadn't been there.
VALENTINA: I don't know what's wrong with him, but if it's about the show.I don't care. I'm tired of it.let the police arrest us. I'm sick of living like this..
TONY: Don't say that. What you're doing is important. Really important. It's just. maybe. it should be done in a different way.
TONY: Oh, hello, good morning sir. How are you feeling? That was a nasty bump on the head you got..
TONY: Well, sir, I've been thinking. It's clear the show's not attracting many people. Forgive me but. I see two ways of tackling this problem.
PERCY: Change the show!? Who the fizzing hell do you think you are?..
DOCTOR PARNASSUS: He sits down heavily.
TONY: I'm sorry but.. you're not modern. People want modern. Look.
PERCY: What about the filth?
TONY: ( puzzled ) The filth. The police.
PERCY: The filth. The police.
TONY: There'll be a better class of police too.
PERCY: That'll be the day.
TONY: The trick is not to hide. Change your colours. Be bold. Go where they would least expect to find you. I think we have been brought together for a reason. I don't believe in coincidence. You saved my life. Now let me do something in return.
DOCTOR PARNASSUS: Our time's nearly up. This could be what we need.
TONY: ( to Valentina ) This can be my birthday gift to
DR. PARNASSUS: Well then. For God's sake let's do it!!!
PERCY: ( sighs ) Yeah, okay, but what exactly do we Well. First of all, I want you to give me your money. All of it.
TONY: Well. First of all, I want you to give me your money. All of it.
DR. PARNASSUS: Anton! Where are you going?
VALENTINA: What are you doing? Didn't you do enough damage last night? Anton. I'm the one who wants to run away! Are you trying to wreck my birthday, or what?
TONY: ( retrieving the money ) Excuse me, madam. I'm afraid we can't accept this.
WOMAN: Excuse me but, how does this work? What does it cost?
TONY: Cost? Money is no good in the Imaginarium. This is a refuge for hearts in need of truth. A place for souls to be purified.
WOMAN 2: How long does that take? I'm running late.
TONY: Madam, why should you care about time? What are your dreams worth in
TONY: Please, I'm sorry but, we're booked solid at the moment.
TONY: Madam, congratulations, you have been chosen.
TONY: Come forward and enter the But, I haven't paid.
TONY: We don't want your money. We want your hopes and dreams. You may make a donation later, if you wish.
TONY: This is a rare moment. Very few are chosen. Don't miss this once-in-a- life-time opportunity. This way.
POLICEMAN: Alright, I think it's time to move on, folks.
TONY: LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN
TONY: ( resisting ) If I'm not wrong, I fear you must go alone.
TONY: It's one of the rules. One imagination at a time, free from the influence of another.
TONY: Oh..look. another possibility..
TONY: ( thinking fast ) Exactly. To be reborn, first you must die. All of them have achieved a kind of immortality. And we love them all the more for it. They won't get old or fat. They won't get sick or feeble. They are beyond fear. They are forever young. They are gods. And you can join them.
TONY: There's not a moment to lose.
TONY: ( gobsmacked ) That was so. I had no idea. It's just. incredible.
DOCTOR PARNASSUS: ( ignoring him and with a
DOCTOR PARNASSUS: ( graciously ) Thank YOU, dear Lady, you give me strength to continue
DR. PARNASSUS: ( aside to Percy ) One more to go and we're free.
GREGOR: Relax.smell the flowers.
SERGE: You thieving scumbag! We break every bone in your body!
TONY: No! Wait! I can explain! Give me a We want our money or you die again! This time for good!
VLADIMIR: We want our money or you die again! This time for good!
ANTON: Stop it! L-leave him alone!
GREGOR: ( bending down and picking
ANTON ): Relax. Smell the flowers.
TONY: Did you see me!! I almost reached the clouds! I could have.it was incredible.I was almost there.
ANTON: Shut up!
TONY: I made my choice and I climbed. I felt so much potential. I could have done anything. I have to have another chance.another go.I need this.
DOCTOR PARNASSUS: ( CONTINUED )
PERCY: That cards! The bloody Tarot cards!
ANTON: You're a l-liar. You've been lying to us all along. Who are you? Who were those thugs?
TONY: I am not a liar!
ANTON: No! I just. didn't divulge everything I knew.
TONY: No! I just. didn't divulge everything I knew.
PERCY: Comes to the same thing.
TONY: Absolutely not. Not in law.
ANTON: You stole their money.
TONY: No. I didn't.
ANTON: That's what they said.
TONY: Are you going to believe them before you believe me?
PERCY: Why not?
TONY: Because they're irredeemably bad people, and I'm essentially good. I know that sounds terribly prim and arrogant and self righteous, but I'm trying to be honest. Look, the truth is. in order to get my charity off the ground I needed
VALENTINA: ( distressed but basically Oh Tony.
TONY: But, can we not talk about me for a moment.. I want to thank the Doctor for letting me experience the most sublime, inspiring ..
ANTON: So why were they trying to k-kill you? "Again!" is what they said.
TONY: ( answering his own The first time they hung you from the b-bridge. right?. B-because you stole their money.
ANTON: ( answering his own The first time they hung you from the b-bridge. right?. B-because you stole their money.
TONY: Stop saying that! I didn't steal it! I didn't have it. I'd had to invest in infrastructure. I needed more time. When you run a charity you have to give lots of money away. You wouldn't believe the red tape. The Charity Commission are a bunch of fascists. It's incredible. I mean. c'mon give me a break.I almost died today.. and I said I'm sorry. and anyway... this was supposed to be a special day.it's Valentina's birthday.
ANTON: The marks on your face.
TONY: They scrawled something on your forehead. Symbols. Signs.
ANTON: They scrawled something on your forehead. Symbols. Signs.
PERCY: You had some of those when we rescued you.
ANTON: Yes, what's that about?
DR. PARNASSUS: ( sotto voce ) No! Leave it!
VALENTINA: ( sotto voce to the DR.
PARNASSUS ): Who is it?
DR. PARNASSUS: ( sotto voce ) It's too late. for visitors.
PERCY: ( sotto voce, agitated ) Please can we answer the door? I can't stand not answering the door, or the telephone, or whatever. It's not in my nature. I won't sleep for weeks if we don't answer the door!
DR. PARNASSUS: ( very down ) I know. It's over..you've Four rotten Russkies?
MR NICK: Four rotten Russkies?
DR. PARNASSUS: And the girl..from the pub.
MR NICK: Sally doesn't count. Do you, gal?
DR. PARNASSUS: You're joking. toying with me. Like a cat with a mouse. As is your privilege.
MR NICK: Sal didn't get to make a real choice. You were gaga. Out for the count. Wouldn't be fair.And you've got four, thanks to your friend Tony. So. we're even. it's not quite over.
DOCTOR PARNASSUS: Valentina. my darling girl. We must do another show! Now! Quickly! Get ready to move out!
VALENTINA: Who was that?
DOCTOR PARNASSUS: Somebody asking the way. Where's I overheard you. He wasn't asking the way.
VALENTINA: I overheard you. He wasn't asking the way.
DOCTOR PARNASSUS: Please! Get everybody together. Another show! Tony! Percy!
VALENTINA: I want to know what's going on.
DOCTOR PARNASSUS: ( harnessing the horses ) Not now.
VALENTINA: Yes, now! I want to know the truth!
DOCTOR PARNASSUS: The truth?
VALENTINA: What are you hiding?
DOCTOR PARNASSUS: There are more important things, at this moment!
VALENTINA: It's something to do with that bloody rambling story you were telling me the night we found Tony isn't it?
DOCTOR PARNASSUS: So tell me.
VALENTINA: So tell me.
DOCTOR PARNASSUS: What I told you was. the truth. I really am thousands of years old. I have been immortal. I have been mortal. And I have had many dealings with the devil. Too many.
VALENTINA: ( fearful ) What are you saying?.
DOCTOR PARNASSUS: Remember the woman I was telling you about?.. the one I was so desperately in love with.. so in love that I made a deal with the devil? That was your mother. .she was so beautiful, so
VALENTINA: What price?
DR. PARNASSUS: ( anguished ) It's too terrible.
VALENTINA: Tell me.
DR. PARNASSUS: I. The price of my obsession. I can't say it.
VALENTINA: Say it.
DR. PARNASSUS: DR. PARNASSUS
VALENTINA: DR. PARNASSUS
DR. PARNASSUS: I was mortal again. on condition that. any children I fathered. would, on their sixteenth birthday. belong to him.
VALENTINA: ( stunned )
DR. PARNASSUS: Your mother never knew. She died before I had to tell her.
VALENTINA: I don't believe this! It can't be true. It's just another of your wretched stories. A cruel story!
DR. PARNASSUS: If only.
VALENTINA: Why do you say these things?
DR. PARNASSUS: It's true. Every word. But all is not lost.
VALENTINA: By playing games with the devil!?
DR. PARNASSUS: With one more show. The day isn't All my life you've made me play `Beauty', `Truth', `Justice'. filled my head with dreams and high ideals. All that crap! While. all the time.! The devil was right! You're arrogant! Vain and arrogant! I'm just another one of your stupid wagers!. You're beneath contempt.
VALENTINA: DR. PARNASSUS

DR. PARNASSUS: Valentina! That's not true! It's not like that! Wait! Come back!
ANTON: What's happened?
DR. PARNASSUS: Valentina. She's. she's gone.
PERCY: Telling the truth. Always a bad
DOCTOR PARNASSUS: You fool! You monstrous fool! You should be dead.
TONY: Saving Valentina.
DOCTOR PARNASSUS: ( befuddled ) What?. How?
TONY: I overheard you. You only need one more to win. Me! I'll be that one. I'll take the risk to save Valentina and, hopefully, you sir. We've still got a few minutes.
DOCTOR PARNASSUS: Yes! Yes! Of course! Of course! Thank God! Thank God!
TONY: ( to himself ) How about thanking me?
DR. PARNASSUS: I expect nothing in return.
TONY: I expect nothing in return.
DR. PARNASSUS: ( trying to go into a No. You're a saint. A saint.
TONY: Only Valentina's hand in marriage, if she'll have me.
DR. PARNASSUS: ( not listening ) Oh, my head.
TONY: And, as your son-in-law. perhaps. initiation into the secrets of the trance.
DR. PARNASSUS: No! I can't do it!
TONY: ( realizing Parnassus is Why not?! What's wrong?
DR. PARNASSUS: My mind. I can't concentrate. I'm too upset.
TONY: You must do it! You have to do it! It's the only way to save your I know.
DR. PARNASSUS: ( distraught ) I know.
TONY: ( sitting PARNASSUS down ) Concentrate. You must concentrate. ( clearing the way to the I'll make the right choice. I'm sure of it. I can feel how right it is already.
DR. PARNASSUS: It's no good!
TONY: PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER!. Sir. Concentrate.or you'll have lost her forever.
VALENTINA: ( sobbing ) It's useless. Hopeless. I thought I was strong, but I don't even know how to run away.
TONY: It's alright. it's alright. Don't cry. It's going to be alright, believe me.
VALENTINA: This stupid theatre.!. That's all I've ever known.! I've always believed it was something precious, but it's not. it's a lie.I hate it!
TONY: Everything's going to be alright. I'll take you away. I'll show you the world. My world. The great big beautiful world I've always dreamed of. You'll love it.
VALENTINA: C'mon then.
TONY: C'mon then.
ANTON: Ah, there you are, Tony. Here's something m-might interest you. 'Missing: D-disgraced head of children's charity'.
TONY: TONY tries to snatch the paper but ANTON steps back.
ANTON: N-not a bad p-picture, Tony. Listen to this Valentina. it's about Tony's b-beautiful world..
ANTON: .Anthony Shepherd, who was arrested last week on charges of.
TONY: ( to Valentina ) Valentina, Don't listen to that. I'm innocent. This is the work of people who are trying to destroy me! Evil people! Believe me! Look, I'll show you the truth!
DOCTOR PARNASSUS: ( sobbing in his trance ) Valentina! Forgive me.
TONY: This isn't right. This is all wrong. Which way?
VALET: Your car is here, Mr.Tony.
TONY: Ah, Lester, just in time.
VALENTINA: No! Tony, don't get in! Get away!
TONY: Help! Over here!
BOATMAN: Give me your hand
TONY: Stop! What are you doing! We'll No we won't. This is the way.
VALENTINA: No we won't. This is the way.
ANTON: Don't d-do it. Don't g-go on. Not with him! He's all lies.
VALENTINA: Just like my father. Leave me alone. I don't care anymore. I want a new life.
TONY: He pulls her away..towards a little tumble-down cottage. Warm candlelight glows in the windows, smoke curls from the chimney. They run to the door. TONY bangs on it. Someone can be heard unlatching the locks inside. A child's crying cuts through the wind. VALENTINA turns and sees a little girl sitting on the path. among flapping laundry. She rushes to her, tries to pick her up but, the little girl resists..
VALENTINA: Tony, help me, she's heavy.
TONY: What is it now?! Can't we just go inside and get dry.
VALENTINA: You did it! You made the right
TONY: Sustainability's great, if you can achieve it. The problem is, in many cases you simply can't, for a whole variety of reasons.
JOURNALIST: Aren't you running the risk of entrenching the need for charity by increasingly institutionalising it?
TONY: Look, charity, like poor little .is always with us, to coin a
JOURNALIST: And what's your message to the Prime Minister?
TONY: ( laughs engagingly ) I wouldn't presume to have a 'message' for the Prime Minister. Fortunately for the Foundation, I think we pretty much see eye to eye on most things.
TONY: You look gorgeous, my love. I knew you wouldn't let me down.
VALENTINA: TONY and VALENTINA look around. ANTON is nowhere to be seen but, his voice continues.
TONY: Call security, somebody.
TONY: What? How?.
ANTON: ( reading and dodging ) 'The disgraced director of the children's charity "Suffer the Little Children, who was arrested
TONY: Stop him. Silence the little .who was arrested last week on charges of involvement in the sale of organs from third world children to wealthy Westerners'.unghh!
ANTON: ( dodging the guards ) .who was arrested last week on charges of involvement in the sale of organs from third world children to wealthy Westerners'.unghh!
TONY: And now he doesn't stutter! You see!? It was all an act to get cheap sympathy!
VALENTINA: ( pulling TONY off ANTON ) Take your hands off him!! Stop it!
TONY: Get off me! What are you doing? You've betrayed me! Haven't you? You let him in.into my world, you bitch!?.. after all I've lavished on you.OW!!
CHILDREN'S CHOIR: "We are the world..we are the My God! Somebody stop him! He's a monster! Get him!
GUESTS: My God! Somebody stop him! He's a monster! Get him!
VALENTINA: VALENTINA, fighting through the angry GUESTS, rushes to the edge of the abyss. ANTON is struggling to hold on to a broken floor joist that protrudes several feet down from the side of the cliff face.
ANTON: Valentina!..help me. Please.
VALENTINA: Forgive me, Anton. I was wrong.
ANTON: I know. I'm not a child.
VALENTINA: Suddenly, VALENTINA is jerked backwards by her hair.
TONY: Who's behind this!? Eh!? You didn't come up with this all on your own did you!!!??? No! Someone's got at you. Someone's paid you!!!. Who!!!??? Tell me!!!
TONY: You old bastard! This is all your All my doing?. I'm merely the facilititatater, dear boy.

VALENTINA: VALENTINA wrenches herself out of their grasp howling like an animal and rushes away out of earshot before the PARAMEDIC can finish speaking.
NOOOOO.!!!: VALENTINA wrenches herself out of their grasp howling like an animal and rushes away out of earshot before the PARAMEDIC can finish speaking.
PARAMEDIC: .d-dead drunk.
VALENTINA: ( to her reflections ) You little fool! You're to blame!.. for everything. I hate you!
MR NICK: Now, there's absolutely no need for that. That's just plain
VALENTINA: ( a crazed look ) Wrong. I'm 16.I'm a woman now..
MR NICK: .only fit for hell? If only.
MR NICK: Damn!. I've won.
MR NICK: Funny how things work out, isn't
TONY: Thank God for that!
DR. PARNASSUS: Give us a moment, please.
TONY: DR. PARNASSUS
DR. PARNASSUS: You're not amused?
TONY: ( desperate ) You've been talking to the devil, haven't you? Let me guess what he said. If you manage to kill me, he'll release Valentina. Yes? Am I right?. I am aren't I? It's all lies. He can't release her. And why not? Because he doesn't have her. He can't have her because she's the ( gaining confidence ) He doesn't have five wins. But if you kill me he will, won't he? You'll have lost Valentina forever!
DR. PARNASSUS: ( CONTINUED )

TONY: DR. PARNASSUS
DR. PARNASSUS: Let's find out.
TONY: TONY swallows the tube as the MOB surge around the gibbet, grabbing him, beating him, and then lifting him onto the chair, tightening the noose around his neck.
DR. PARNASSUS: ( hoarsely ) There are three cardinal rules. One, there's no black-magic, only cheap tricks. And. er. I forget the others. Now, where's my How should I know? You're her ( with needle ) Her loving father.
MR NICK: How should I know? You're her Her loving father.
DR. PARNASSUS: What else could I do, Valentina? What else could I have done. What other choice could I have made?. Damn!. It was the right choice. Of course it was. Of course. But where are you?
DR. PARNASSUS: DR. PARNASSUS, overjoyed, begins to dig PERCY out.
PERCY: About bloody time!
DR. PARNASSUS: Where have you been?
PERCY: ( irritated ) How long have you been here?
DR. PARNASSUS: How long have you been here?
PERCY: How long's a piece of string? Don't ask daft questions.
DR. PARNASSUS: Thank God I found you. I need your I've got a problematical choice to Problematical my arse! Come on. I know it's against the grain.

VALENTINA: Billy, this is your grandad. Say hello to your grandad. I think he looks a little like you.
ANTON: Hello Doctor.
VALENTINA: We're both happy.
DR. PARNASSUS: Beautifully made. It'll last for years if properly looked after.
DR. PARNASSUS: I'm afraid we can't guarantee that.
