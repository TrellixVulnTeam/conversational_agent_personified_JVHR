FIRST DRAFT: UNDERWATER - CLOSE-UP: A brightly colored FLY, attached to a dangling, fishing line. A large SALMON swims to the fly. The salmon EXAMINES the fly, deciding whether or not to bite. CAMERA PANS UPWARD, tracking the line and moving OUT OF THE WATER. We PASS the crooked boards of a small ROWBOAT and continue to PAN UPWARD. A MAN reclines in the boat. NAPPING. His hands gently grip a WOODEN FISHING POLE. He is handsomely dressed in SPORTSMAN'S trousers and a blazer. His green, tweed fishing hat is lowered OVER HIS FACE. Its brim is filled with various types of TACKLE and BAIT. It is DUSK. A warm, SUMMER evening. The boat rests on a calm lake, surrounded by MOORS. Thick night FOG has begun to settle over the entire area.
INDIANA'S POV: Countless ORANGE FLAMES sparkle across the moors. The TORCHES are being carried by several members of a small village. The VILLAGERS are gathered behind a group of SIX POLICEMEN. The policemen are headed by INSPECTOR ANGUS MACGOWAN, a plump, balding fellow, with a veiny, bulbous nose, beady green eyes and a thick, curled red moustache. MacGowan SHOUTS to Indy.
MACGOWAN: We need your assistance!
INDIANA: ( struggling with the fishing line ) C'mon, Mac. It's the first bite I've had all week.
MACGOWAN: Please. It's very importantl.
INDIANA: Do you value our friendship, Mac?
MACGOWAN: More than me' nightly pint.
INDIANA: Then this better not be some wild goose chase.
MACGOWAN: T'ain't wild geese we're after, Doctor Jones. You got me' word on .and a MacGowan's word is truer than an angel's kiss!
YOUNG MAN: Scotty Ferguson.
OLD WOMAN: He's the eighth.
MAN: Just like the others.all his bones Whatever's killin' people around here ain't human.
OLD MAN: Whatever's killin' people around here ain't human.
WOMAN: ( pointing OFFSCREEN ) It's there! Again!
MACGOWAN: That light.only burns after a murder's been committed.
INDIANA: ( nods, turning toward the castle ) Let's go.
MACGOWAN: Well. Ahmmmm.that is what we're here for.eh, men?.ah. Hennesey. Galbraith. Bottomley. You're comin' with us.
ELDERLY WOMAN: May God help them.
HENNESEY: It's deathly cold in 'ere. How could a human bein' survive?.
INDIANA: This guy's got one hell of an ego.
MACGOWAN: Baron Seamus Seagrove III. Some say 'e walks the moors every midnight. others claim e's been dead for
MACGOWAN: Hennesey?. Hennesey?.
GALBRAITH: ( panic ) 'E was standin' right 'ere! Just a second ago. Standin' right beside
MACGOWAN: Thanks for catchin' me.
INDIANA: I'd rather be catchin' trout.
INDIANA: Interesting blood type.
INDIANA: Cabernet sauvignon. 1897.
GALBRAITH: ( pointing OFF SCREEN )
MACGOWAN: Galbraith. You come with me! We'll search for Hennesey. Out here! Bottomley. You go with Doctor In there.
INDIANA: Let's get outta' here.
BOTTOMLEY: Inspector MacGowan! Galbraith! Open the door!
INDIANA: ( motioning to candle ) I need more light.
INDIANA: NO answer. Indy SHINES his flashlight toward the area. The candle is GONE. There is NO SIGN of Bottomley. Indiana takes a STEP FORWARD.
INDIANA: AGAIN, no answer. Indy SWEEPS the flashlight beam across the room. It PASSES one of the coffins.then SHOOTS BACK! Indy is met with a
SHOCKING SIGHT!: BOTTOMLEY LIES INSIDE THE COFFIN! DEAD! His face twisted in a GHOULISH SMILE. All of his bones BROKEN. His hands are wrapped around a CRUCIFIX. Indy STARES in horror. There is a SOUND. FOOTSTEPS. There is SOMEONE ELSE in here. Indy's flashlight beam DARTS around the crypt. There is NO SIGN of anyone.
INDIANA: Who is it?. Who's there?.
MACGOWAN: Doctor Jones! Try to push!
INDIANA: Can't! There's some kinda' hot ice coverin' the.
SNAPS!: Indiana FALLS! His body DROPS hundreds of feet into the blackness. A MOMENT passes. Then. WE HEAR A SPLASH!
INDIANA: NOW they bite!
UNDERWATER: In desperation, Indy SWIMS downward. Looking for an ALTERNATE ESCAPE. But there is NO BOTTOM in sight. Indy's eyes BULGE. His face loses COLOR. Only a few precious SECONDS OF LIFE remain.when suddenly, he SPOTS SOMETHING. A SMALL TUNNEL. Built into the CAVERN WALL. Indiana hurriedly SWIMS to the tunnel. He BOLTS inside. A WATER FOUNTAIN. A large, THREE TIERED stone structure. Instead of the familiar carvings of angels and beautiful maidens, this fountain is surrounded with water spewing DEMONS, GARGOYLES and hellish BEASTS. CAMERA DOLLIES TO A LARGE METAL DRAIN, located inside of the fountain's base. The drain cover begins to TURN. Suddenly FLIPPING OPEN! Indiana CRAWLS out of the opening. He GULPS at the air. COLOR returns to his face. LIFE returns to his body. Indy RISES to his feet. He finds himself STANDING in the fountain.
INDY'S POV: He is inside of a BANQUET ROOM. The sprawling room is beautifully DECORATED in Victorian dignity. The room is IMMACULATE. Not one SPECK of dust. Two Medieval SUITS OF ARMOR adorn one wall. A gargantuan crystal CHANDELIER hangs above a long, mahogany BANQUET TABLE. At the far end of the table, sits a shriveled, white haired ELDERLY MAN. It is BARON SEAMUS SEAGROVE III, the fellow whose likeness appeared in every piece of artwork. Baron Seagrove is CALMLY eating his dinner. A bloated ROASTED PIG rests on a silver platter before him. The same candle we saw burning in the upstairs room and the family crypt, now RESTS on the table. Directly BESIDE the Baron. Two powerful, muscular MASTIFFS are tied to Baron Seagrove's chair. Teeth BARED. Eyes AELAZE. The hounds FIGHT for a scrap of meat. Indiana stares in BEWILDERMENT at the new surroundings. He STEPS OUT of the fountain. Baron Seagrove seems UNAWARE of Indy's presense. Indiana WALKS TOWARD the Baron.
INDIANA: Excuse me, sir.? Hello.?
INDIANA: Canyou hear me?.
INDIANA: still WALKS toward the table. The Baron continues to IGNORE him. Indy is ANNOYED.
INDIANA: Listen, pal. There are two dead Policemen upstairs and.
INDIANA: Chow time's over, mister. You better start talkin'.
INDIANA: There's a lot of strange things happening around here.
INDIANA: .and I want some answers! Do you hear me? I want some answers! Now!
INDIANA: Haven't you had enough?
MACGOWAN: Now you can get back to your fishing, Doctor Jones.
INDIANA: No chance, Mac. My plane leaves in the morning. Vacation's over. Gotta' get back to school.
MACGOWAN: ( shakes his head ) 'Tis a shame to go home empty ( smiles, an idea ) Tell ya' what, my friend. I fancy me'self quite the fisherman. Tomorrow, I'll go out and catch you a real beauty, eh?.
INDIANA: ( sarcastic smirk ) Right. Send it to me airmail.
MACGOWAN: ( incredulous ) Doctor Jones! A MacGowan's word is truer than.
INDIANA: Yeah, yeah.an angel's kiss. I
BARON SEAGROVE: A CHILL rushes through Indiana. The Baron turns, CONTINUING to the Police wagon. One of the villagers SHOUTS.
VILLAGER: 'E's done it! Indiana Jones has captured the killer!
INDY'S POV: Baron Seagrove CLIMBS into the back compartment of the police vehicle. Galbraith CLOSES the vehicle doors. The Baron is still VISIBLE through the vehicle's windows. He LIGHTS a cigarette. It appears that the MATCH FLAME SHINES THROUGH THE BARON'S BODY! It's as if he were a
GHOST!: Indiana TURNS to the others. Eyes WIDE. SHOCKED. But it is obvious that NO ONE else has SEEN the apparition. MacGowan notices the PALE expression on Indy's face.
MACGOWAN: What is it, man? You look as if you've seen a screamin' banshee!
INDIANA: Ah. It was nothing, Mac. Nothing at all.
TEDDY: Doctor Jones. I took your class instead of all the others!. I coulda' had Professor Needles. Professor Eisenschmidt. You promised. You said you'd have 'em graded by yesterday.
ANGELA: You promised. You said you'd have 'em graded by yesterday.
VIRGIL: My paper finished yet? Name's "Virgil Vektor". That's VIRGIL. Capital V. I. R.
JULIA: My parents paid good money to send me here. You know how much they shelled out for your class?
CHARLES: He doesn't care about us. He only wants fame and fortune. We're just a buncha' peons to him.
VIRGIL: VEKTOR. Capital V. E. K.
BETSY: Hello, Ind Doctor Jones.
INDIANA: Not now, Betsy.
BETSY: LOOK at all of those papers!
INDIANA: Please, I.

PRIESTLY: What about you, Jonesey? You were over in Scotty-land for two weeks. Didja' catch the big one?.
INDIANA: Look, Priestly. I'm real busy.
REBECCA: Two-timing bastard!
REBECCA: How could you?!?. My own Mother?!?. In my own bed?!?. I've had it with you! It's over!
DEAN COVENTRY: Doctor Jones, I've had complaints from several of the students
POSTMAN: Sign here.
DEAN COVENTRY: They feel that you are ignoring them, that you are distracted.
INDIANA: ( gives Postman the signed paper ) Me?. Distracted?.
POSTMAN: ( staring at Indy's signature, puzzled ) What's this? "B+"? That's how you sign your name?
DEAN COVENTRY: Marshall University is not the place for sloppy behavior.
DEAN COVENTRY: I have one final warning for you, Doctor Jones
INDIANA: Yes. Oh, Hello, Marcus. Look, can you hold on?. You were saying, sir?
DEAN COVENTRY: Either you begin concentrating on Yes, Marcus. I'm still here. Just hold on! I'm very sorry, sir.
INDIANA: ( interrupted by phone ) Yes, Marcus. I'm still here. Just hold on! ( back to Dean ) I'm very sorry, sir.
DEAN COVENTRY: ( boiling ) concentrating on your teaching duties or
INDIANA: ( into phone ) Damn it, Marcus! I'm standing here with Dean. What?.. Just how ( listening, impatient ) It is, huh?. Okay. Five minutes. Yeah. I'll be right over. But this better be important, Marcus!
DEAN COVENTRY: You are on probation, Jones! Ten days! If there is no improvement, you will be dismissed!
INDIANA: I promise.by tomorrow.I'll have all of these graded.and DRIED!
VIRGIL: VIRGIL VEKTOR! Capital V. I.
INDIANA: ( hands him paper )
"F"!: Virgil STARES at his paper, adorned with a large RED "F"! Indiana EXITS the room.
INDIANA: This better be important, Marcus. or the museum will soon be displaying my bones. My teaching career is in danger of extinction.
MARCUS: ( smiles ) You will not be disappointed,
INDIANA: "Sun wu Kung, The Stone Monkey King". Big deal. That was ten years ago, Marcus. Geez! This Heller kid's got the worst grammar.
MARCUS: Ten years or fifty years. It will always be in your blood.
INDIANA: ( ignoring Marcus ) Don't believe this. He spells "repeat" with two "E's".
MARCUS: Think back, Indiana. Remember your desire? Your passion?
INDIANA: ( still ignores Marcus ) Kid gets an "A" on content.a "D" on form.
MARCUS: ( angry, slams his fist on the desk ) Damn it, man! You can't bury those feelings forever! Two years. Nearly two years of my life.looking for the remains of that Monkey.a piece of his legendary Golden Hooped Rod.or some sign of the Lost City. ( shakes his head ) Nine men perished on the journey. Rest of us nearly died from starvation or one of the many horrible deseases we discovered. ( looks back to papers, in a near whisper ) We still came back empty handed.
INDIANA: Two years. Nearly two years of my life.looking for the remains of that Monkey.a piece of his legendary Golden Hooped Rod.or some sign of the Lost City. Nine men perished on the journey. Rest of us nearly died from starvation or one of the many horrible deseases we discovered. We still came back empty handed.
MARCUS: ( threading the projector ) One mustn't give up so easily, Give up?!?. Marcus, we spent thirteen months in China!.another seven in India!.
INDIANA: Give up?!?. Marcus, we spent thirteen months in China!.another seven in India!.
MARCUS: But none in Africa.
INDIANA: ( puzzled expression ) There was no proof.archeological or anthropological.to indicate that Sun Wu-Kung ever visited Until now.
MARCUS: Until now.
INDIANA: Hey. My papers.
MARCUS: The woman is Dr. Clare Clarke. The famous zoologist. She works in Africa, studying animals in their natural habitat.
INDIANA: Very interesting, Marcus. Now if you'll turn the lights back on
MARCUS: ( continuing ) Three weeks ago, Dr. Clarke discovered that cute little fellow. "Tyki".a pygmy of an unusual race.unrelated to any known African tribe.
INDIANA: ( bored ) Marcus. The lights.
MARCUS: Dr. Clarke believes that Tyki comes from the Lost Civilization of Sun
INDIANA: What?. But how did Miss
MARCUS: "Doctor" Clake. How did she arrive at such a preposterous hypothesis?
INDIANA: "Doctor" Clake. How did she arrive at such a preposterous hypothesis?
MARCUS: The pygmy speaks in a language that has no African origins.but bears a strong resemblance to Chinese.
INDIANA: Means nothing. The rivers of Africa have been plagued by various Oriental Pirates and Scavengers since the 16th Century. Not much evidence, Marcus.
MARCUS: There's more. The pygmy was found wearing an ornamental peach stone around his neck.believed to come from Sun Wu-Kung's legendary Garden Of Immortal Peaches.
INDIANA: ( skeptical ) Marcus, there are countless undiscovered African tribes.all with various obscure beliefs and ( smirks ) One tribe may wear peach stones. another may wear banana peels.
MARCUS: There is one final bit of Enlighten me.
INDIANA: Enlighten me.
MARCUS: The pygmy is over 200 years old.
INDIANA: That's impossible.
MARCUS: Dr. Clarke has done a considerable amount of testing on the pygmy's clothing.his sandals.everything was over 200 years old.
INDIANA: ( skeptical ) He's probably wearing his Great Grandfather's stuff.
INDIANA: What does all of this have to do with me?
MARCUS: Dr. Clarke wants to mount an expedition to find the Lost City of Sun Wu-Kung. She is quite familiar with your reputation.she'd like you to come along.
INDIANA: ( gathering his papers ) No chance.
MARCUS: There will be money involved. The museum is willing to fund the Sorry, Marcus. I've burned this
INDIANA: Sorry, Marcus. I've burned this
MARCUS: Indy TURNS. He WAVES the papers at Marcus.
INDIANA: Marcus. Please. I've got to finish You've got to finish something much more important. You crossed the threshold over a decade ago.and it's been tearing at your insides ever since. My friend, if there is even one iota of truth in Dr. Clarke's findings. then you can lift the veil of mystery that has surrounded this Chinese legend for Centuries. You may uncover the secrets to a Lost Civilization.and possibly, to man's never ending search for

MARCUS: Indiana. Can you afford to pass up the single most important adventure of your life?
BETSY: You can't do this to me!
INDIANA: ( shaking tears off the papers ) C'mon, Betsy. Relax. You're gettin' 'em all wet again.
BETSY: You just can't go away.I mean. Africa is so far away, and.well. I love you, Indy.
INDIANA: Thought we agreed this was s'posed to be casual.
BETSY: You call what happened last night My dear.a momentary lapse into passion does not a love affair make.
INDIANA: My dear.a momentary lapse into passion does not a love affair make.
BETSY: ( very upset ) Momentary lapse! So that's all I am to you!
INDIANA: Betsy. Wait.
INDIANA: ( angry ) Whatsa' matter with you!. Tryin' to ruin my whip!.
BETSY: If I can't have you. I don't want to live.
INDIANA: Drink this. You'll feel better. C'mon, Betsy. Get a hold of yourself. You're young. There are a lot of other guys.
INDIANA: C'mon, Betsy. Get a hold of yourself. You're young. There are a lot of other guys.
BETSY: Not like you.
INDIANA: ( succumbing to his ego ) That's true. ( realizing his mistake ) But that's no reason to stop living! Besides, I'm too old for you. By the time you're seventy five, I'll be. ( calculates, the thought of it makes him grimace ) Yeccchhh! I'll be disgusting.
BETSY: Don't leave me, Indy!
INDIANA: ( cruel ) Look. You're just a flighty kid. Twenty minutes after I walk out this door, you'll have a date with the college Romeo. Two hours from now, you'll be madly in love with him. By tomorrow, you'll forget I ever
BETSY: Never underestimate the determination of a Brooklyn girl, Doctor Jones. Never.
INDIANA JONES: stands aboard the ship's DECK. It is a typical, 30's LUXURY Ocean liner, filled with vacationing TOURISTS. Indiana STARES into the sunrise. His face is a study in CONCENTRATION and INTENSITY. He anxiously AWAITS his adventure.
SCRAGGY BRIER: Indiana's friend and guide, JUMPS out of the taxi. Scraggy is a rough, unkempt AFRICAN MAN. An elderly fellow, with the ENERGY and VITALITY of a youth. His snow white hair and beard are WILD. SPIKED. He wears TATTERED, DIRTY clothes that are many sizes too large for his SKINNY body. Homemade CROCODILE SANDALS flop on his feet. Scraggy suddenly breaks into a WILD GRIN. He SPOTS Indiana. Scraggy SHOOTS up the exit ramp, running through the crowd of people. Scraggy stops a FEW FEET in front of Indiana. Scraggy WAVES his arms before him, as if he were BLESSING Indiana. Following this, Scraggy LEAPS into Indy's arms. Indiana CRADLES Scraggy like a child. Speaking with a Portugese accent, Scraggy EXCLAIMS.
SCRAGGY: Indy! At last we are reunited! Oh, Keechingo, God Of Friendship.I thank you for granting my wish!
INDIANA: I see you haven't changed, Scraggy.
SCRAGGY: Mahootmek, God Of Goodness, say. "Before body make contact with foreign object.one must cast out bad spirits, or "
INDIANA: " or bad spirits will enter your Yes! You have excellent memory, I should! Last time we saw each other.you made me wear the same clothes for 3 weeks straight.
SCRAGGY: Yes! You have excellent memory, I should! Last time we saw each other.you made me wear the same clothes for 3 weeks straight.
INDIANA: I should! Last time we saw each other.you made me wear the same clothes for 3 weeks straight.
SCRAGGY: Never separate body from clothes, or bad spirits will hide in pockets!
INDIANA: In other words. If people never changed clothes.there would be no evil in the world.
SCRAGGY: ( chuckles, puts his arm around Scraggy ) I missed all a' your crazy philosophies, Scraggy.
INDIANA: ( chuckles, puts his arm around Scraggy ) I missed all a' your crazy philosophies, Scraggy.
SCRAGGY: They not so crazy, Indy. These days. There is much evil in the air. I feel it. Everywhere.
GUTTERBUHG: ( German, English subtitles ) Are we making contact?
SCRAGGY: Dr. Clarke! Why you kick Dr.
CLARE: Dr. Jones! Forgive me.
INDIANA: No sweat.
CLARE: Thought I was being attacked by a degenerate sailor.
INDIANA: No. Just a degenerate archeologist.
CLARE: Your appearance is deceiving.
INDIANA: They exchange a handshake and a SMILE. Immediately ATTRACTED to each Indiana TURNS. A ship PORTER walks through the crowd, pushing a LARGE BARREL on a dolly. Indy WAVES to the Porter. The Porter STOPS in front of him.
PORTER: You left this aboard ship.
INDIANA: ( puzzled ) There must be some mistake. I
PORTER: That's you, ain't it?
INDIANA: Well, yeah.but.
SCRAGGY: Indy! Remember Mahootmek, God Of Goodness! "Before body make contact with foreign object "
SCRAGGY: ".you must cast out bad spirits!"
INDIANA: May I call you "Clare"?
CLARE: Well, Clare. We've obviously got a lot of notes to compare. Let's get started tonight.over dinner.
INDIANA: Well, Clare. We've obviously got a lot of notes to compare. Let's get started tonight.over dinner.
CLARE: I'd like that very much.
INDIANA: Friend of mine owns a Cafe. He'll get us a nice quiet table. No disturbances. Just the two of us
SCRAGGY: I warn you, Indy! You must always cast out bad spirits!
BETSY: My precious!
CLARE: ( puzzled, to Indy ) Your daughter?
INDIANA: My assistant.
BETSY: His girlfriend.
CLARE: ( revolted ) A child!
INDIANA: ( to Clare ) It's nothing. Really. ( to Betsy ) What the hell are you doing here'?
BETSY: Proving my love for you.
CLARE: How terribly sordid.
INDIANA: ( to Clare ) Puppy love. Schoolgirl crush. She'll get over it.
BETSY: Never. This proves that nothing can come between us. Not an ocean. Not two separate Continents.
CLARE: Think I'm going to be ill.
INDIANA: ( puzzled, to Betsy ) How.I mean. How could you stay Hey. I'm from Brooklyn.
BETSY: Hey. I'm from Brooklyn.
INDIANA: But we'ye been sailing for three Stowed away in the banana barrel. Ate my way to the bottom.

BETSY: ( reluctantly shaking Clare's hand ) Betsy Tuffet.
CLARE: As in curds and whey?
BETSY: ( getting tough ) Listen, sister. You better stay away from Indy.
CLARE: My dear, he has no interest in me. I've already celebrated my tenth
INDIANA: Look, Betsy. Why don't you get back on the boat. This time, as a Too late, Indy.
SCRAGGY: Too late, Indy.
INDIANA: When's the next one out?
SCRAGGY: Two weeks.
MEPHISTO: ( German, English subtitles ) Were you successful?
MEPHISTO: ( German, English subtitles ) Keep a record of everything that is
MEPHISTO: ( German, English subtitles ) Ever since our battle for the Lost Ark. The feuhrer has been very interested in the adventures of Indiana Jones. Very interested.
CLARE: Tyki. This is Doctor Jones.
INDIANA: He's a real gentleman.
CLARE: ( shrugs ) Just basic manners. What it takes most men a lifetime to learn. Tyki's accomplished in two weeks. ( introduces Scraggy ) This is our guide, Scraggy Brier. and Miss Bets
CLARE: It appears that Bonzo is attracted to Miss Tuffet's Derfume. Eau De Banana Peel.
INDIANA: Where did you find him?.
CLARE: About ten miles from here. We were on a photographic expedition.in the thick of the jungle. I heard sounds. Whimpering. Moaning. I took a few steps, and found Tyki. He was lying in a shallow swamp.semi conscious.a high fever.nearly dead from exhaustion. He had obviously been travelling on foot for many days, over countless miles. So I brought him back to the compound.nursed him back to
INDIANA: Clare, I hate to quibble with your anthropological abilities.
CLARE: .but if this little fellow is over 200 years old. I mean. What accounts for his youthful appearance?.his vitality?.
INDIANA: .but if this little fellow is over 200 years old. I mean. What accounts for his youthful appearance?.his vitality?.
INDIANA: STUDYING the peach pit. The fruit fly continues to BUZZ around Indiana's head.
INDIANA: There's nothing unusual about this .nothing to indicate that it's from Sun Wu Kung's garden.
CLARE: This fruit fly had a normal life- span of TWENTY FOUR HOURS. As an experiment.the fly was put in this room.alone.with only the peach stone to sustain its existence. The fly stayed alive for
INDIANA: Indiana and Clare are suddenly INTERRUPTED by the sound of Scraggy and Tyki's LAUGHTER. This is followed by the two of them having a DISCUSSION! In Tyki's FOREIGN TONGUE! Clare and Indy exchange a SHOCKED GLANCE and DASH out of the room.
CLARE: He understands him?
INDIANA: ( nods ) Scraggy knows hundreds of languages. He's the best guide in ( turns to Scraggy ) Ask Tyki where he came from.
SCRAGGY: He say. "I come from 'Land Of City On Clouds'".
INDIANA: ( puzzled ) Huh?. What the hell's that s'posed to mean? ( to Scraggy ) Can he take us there?
SCRAGGY: He say if he could. He would go
SCRAGGY: He say "Pai Cho" may help you.
CLARE: "Pai Cho"?
INDIANA: The Sacres Proverbs and Writings of Sun Wu Kung. His disciples always carry the Pai Cho with them.
INDIANA: Can you translate it?.
BETSY: Bonzo moves its lips to Betsy and gives her a BIG KISS! SMACK! Betsy GRIMACES. Finally, Clare begins to make BIZARRE MONKEY HAND MOTIONS and SOUNDS. Bonzo TURNS. He UNDERSTANDS Clare. She continues to COMMUNICATE with the chimp, until Bonzo turns and RUNS out of the cage! Indiana and Scraggy exchange an IMPRESSED GLANCE. Betsy WIPES the kiss from her lips.
SCRAGGY: "Sun Wu Kung run like fire, He journey to Many Monkey Land, To build his final empire."
BETSY: Who's Sun Wu-Kung?
INDIANA: ( ignoring Betsy, to Scraggy ) Many Monkey Land. That's a definite reference to Africa.
BETSY: Africa?. He journeyed to That confirms our suspicions that he may have formed his Civilization What civilization?
CLARE: ( also ignores Betsy, to Indiana ) That confirms our suspicions that he may have formed his Civilization What civilization?
BETSY: What civilization?
INDIANA: ( angry, to Betsy ) Betsy. Keep your trap shut. This doesn't concern you.
BETSY: ( insulted ) Fine. Terrific. Who cares about this stuff anyway! We're in a nightclub. We should be havin' fun. ( grabs Indiana's hand ) C'mon, Indy. Let's dance.
INDIANA: What a buncha' stiffs! Bet you can't dance.
BETSY: What a buncha' stiffs! Bet you can't dance.
CLARE: Quite the contrary.I spent several months studying dance.
BETSY: Oh yeah? Whattayou' know?. The Bunny Hop?. The Jitterbug?.
CLARE: ( shakes her head ) The Bondogea. The Kyebe Kyebe. The African Tribal dances.
BETSY: African Tribal dances.
CLARE: African Tribal dances.
BETSY: Never heard of 'em.
CLARE: Of course not. They're beyond the spectrum of your microscopic world.
INDIANA: GLARES at Betsy. Clare REACHES for her cup of coffee. She NOTICES that the coffee cup trembles SLIGHTLY. Clare GLANCES beneath the table, and sees Betsy RUBBING Indy's leg. Clare is DISGUSTED. ABOVE the table, Clare shoots a scowl of DISAPPROVAL at Indy. A FLUSTERED Indy tries to explain.but is suddenly INTERRUPTED by a hand on his shoulder. It is DASHIELL, the suave, HANDSOME owner of the restaurant. Dashiell gives a CaARMING SMILE to everyone at the table.
DASHIELL: Enjoying your dinners?.
DASHIELL: Watch yourself, sport. Most of the talk here tonight is about you. And it isn't good.
DASHIELL: I don't know what you've done to the Nazis. But they are certainly no friends of yours.
GUARD: Who's there?.
TYKI: STARES into the dark night. FEAR covers his face. He is SEATED inside of his cage. A CANDLE flickers beside him. Tyki's hands REST on the beautiful tapestry. Tyki LISTENS. He hears FOOTSTEPS. COMING toward his cage. Tyki REACHES to his side. He grabs a STONE DAGGER. Suddenly, a LOOD GONSHOT! The SPLINTERED LOCK from Tyki's cage goes spinning across the floor. The cage door CREAKS OPEN. GUTTERBUHG stands in the doorway. TWO NAZI SOLDIERS, HELMUT and KLACE ( who we met earlier ), are beside him. Gutterbuhg SMILES. His stiff right arm EXTENDS from his side. His leather gloved INDEX FINGER is POINTING ahead. Tyki GROWLS at the Nazis. He STANDS. RAISING the stone dagger OVER HIS
INDIANA: tries to IGNORE Betsy's playing. Scraggy continues to TRANSLATE the
SCRAGGY: "With his Golden Hooped Rod, And its powerful lightning rays, Sun Wu Kung build Water Curtain Cave, Where he live for 500 days."
CLARE: The Golden Hooped Rod?
INDIANA: A heavenly staff with many different powers.most notably, it had the ability to transform itself into hundreds of objects. It remains the most priceless treasure of Sun Wu Kung's empire.
CLARE: And what is the.the Water Curtain Sun Wu Kung's legendary hideout.an enormous secret cave, hidden behind a running waterfall.
INDIANA: Sun Wu Kung's legendary hideout.an enormous secret cave, hidden behind a running waterfall.
INDIANA: This proves that the Water Curtain Cave exists in Africa. Does it mention anything about Sun Wu Kung's travels?
SCRAGGY: ( reading scroll ) Only place called."Twisted Snake The Zarnbesi River! It has a reputation for its deadly water It would have been Sun Wu Kung's logical path.
INDIANA: The Zarnbesi River! It has a reputation for its deadly water It would have been Sun Wu Kung's logical path.
CLARE: It would have been Sun Wu Kung's logical path.
INDIANA: ( confident, anxious ) It will also be our logical path.
ABOVE TABLE: Indiana's hand is buried beneath the table, STRUGGLING to remove the bug. To Clare, it appears as if Indy is PLAYING with Betsy's foot. Clare gives an INCREDULOUS look to Indiana.
CLARE: Please try to control that monstrous libido of yours!
INDIANA: We have to get back to the compound. Tyki may be in danger.
NAZI HEADQUARTERS: The Nazi wearing the radio HEADPHONES emits a LOUD SCREAM! His eardrums BURSTING with the trumpet sound!
INDIANA: Get your hands off him.
INDIANA: When I tell you. Hit the brakes!
INDIANA: Now, Scraggy!
BETSY: About time we had some fun!
SCRAGGY: Bad spirits have Indy! He in trouble! Big trouble!
UNDERWATER: Indiana and Klaus CONTINUE their battle. They wrestle only a few feet from the ship's large, SPINNING STEEL PROPELLERS. The propellers create a SUCTION FORCE. DRAWING Indy and Klaus CLOSER. CLOSER. toward a SPINNING DEATH. Indy and Klaus grab hold of a dangling, STEEL ANCHOR. PREVENTING their bodies from being sucked into the propellers. Klaus PULLS a switchblade from his pocket. He ATTACKS Indy's CLENCHED FINGERS with the knife. Indy begins to LOSE HIS GRIP. His body INCHES toward the propellers. Klaus RAISES the knife, to FINISH OFF Indiana. But Klaus' UNTIED SHOELACE dangles beside the propellers. The shoelace CATCHES a spinning blade. The SHOCKED Nazi is pulled INTO THE

GUTTERBUHG: Goodnight, Doctor Jones.
DASHIELL: Scraggy said you might be needing some help, sport.
DASHIELL: Indy! Rollout!
DASHIELL: You okay, sport?
INDIANA: Dashiell TURNS BACK. The speedboat is HEADED STRAIGHT FOR A SOLID WOODEN WALL! A sign on the wall reads: FUTTERMAN'S FISHING WAREHOUSE. The Nazi speedboat has already made a SHARP TURN, AVOIDING the warehouse. There's NO TIME for Dashiell to TURN. Indy HITS the deck. The speedboat ARCHES upward, at an ANGLE. CRASH! The speedboat BLASTS into the warehouse. Splintered wood SPLATTERS through the air.
INDIANA'S POV: The NAZI SPEEDBOAT shoots out of the docks, ESCAPING across the water. Indiana grabs his WHIP. He KICKS OPEN the warehouse window. He SNAPS his wrist. CRACK. The whip SHOOTS forward, ATTACHING ITSELF TO THE REAR OF THE NAZI SPEEDBOAT! Indy firmly GRIPS his end of the whip. The whip TIGHTENS. WHOOSH! Indiana is PULLED out of the window. Gutterbuhg exchanges a VICTORIOUS laugh with Rudolph, the speedboat driver, thinking they have LOST Indiana. A frightened Tyki LOOKS BACK. His eyes suddenly fill with HOPE. Gutterbuhg TURNS. His mouth DROPS
BETSY: What a romantic night!
CLARE: Will they hurt Tyki?
INDIANA: ( shaking his head ) They know he's important to us. ( holds up ancient scroll ) They'll use him to bargain for this.
BETSY: Indy, you smell so good! So
CLARE: Will they be following us?
INDIANA: Every step of the way.
BETSY: Mmmm, Indy. I love it when you don't shave. It's so sexy!

BETSY: How 'bout a little goodnight kiss?
BETSY: Mmmmm, Indy.you really know the way to a girl's heart!
CLARE: What is that awful aroma?
INDIANA: Scraggy's takin' a shower.
INDIANA: He believes that onions keep bad spirits from entering his body.
CLARE: ( writing in her notebook ) In all my years of anthropology. I've never run across anyone or anything quite like Scraggy.
INDIANA: ( chuckles ) He's a rare breed. ( turns, looks at Clare for the first time ) You're looking very lovely.
CLARE: You're looking very lecherous.
INDIANA: ( turns away, angry ) Just tryin' to be friendly.
CLARE: Save it for the schoolgirls.
INDIANA: Look, Clare. Betsy's just an anxious archeology student.she admires my work. Who can blame her?. But it's just some kinda' hero worship thing.
BETSY: ( pops in from OFF SCREEN, kisses Indiana ) I dreamed about our first night
INDIANA: You're writin' this down?.
CLARE: ( nods ) I'm keeping an accurate record of our journey.
INDIANA: What's that got to do with my personal life?
CLARE: Evidence. I plan on testifying at your child molestation trial.
INDIANA: Why do I do this to myself?
BETSY: ( holds her head in pain, to Clare ) Hey, lady.you're s'posed to be a Doctor.you got any cures for a The best I've heard was used by a New Zealand Tribe. ( pauses, thinking ) One part crushed owl skull.two parts rhino saliva.one part zebra
CLARE: The best I've heard was used by a New Zealand Tribe. One part crushed owl skull.two parts rhino saliva.one part zebra
INDIANA: No, No. Get a cup of donkey sweat .two spoons of skunk hair.and one pint of shredded lizard tongue.
SCRAGGY: I always use family cure! Two spoons chopped leeches. Half cup horse mucous.two quarts crocodile urine!
BETSY: ( ready to throw up )
SCRAGGY: How far we travel, Indy?.
INDIANA: Almost 20 miles.
CLARE: Any sign of the Nazis?
INDIANA: ( shakes his head, confident ) Long as we keep up this pace. they'll have trouble tracking us.
MEPHISTO: ( German, English subtitles ) We must leave. Immediately.
ABOARD SHIP: Indiana, Scraggy, Clare and Betsy are GATHERED on the deck. Seated in a CIRCLE. They are surrounded by the CREW MEMBERS. Everyone eats their DINNER from tin cans. The surrounding lanterns cast an EERIE LIGHT on the area. The young crew member plays a soft, SPOOKY tune on his guitar. Betsy is RESTLESS. She GLARES at the guitar player.
BETSY: Don't you know somethin' else? Somethin' upbeat?.
BETSY: It's so hot. Stuffy. Do we have to stay on this stupid boat all We have to keep moving.
INDIANA: ( nods ) We have to keep moving.
BETSY: Can we at least jump in the water?. Go for a swim?.
CLARE: There's an old legend about the Zambesi. In ancient times, criminals were given their choice of execution.or swimming across the Zambesi. Most chose execution.
INDIANA: Clare's right. We'll be safer on the Now quit moanin' and eat your food. You are so rude! I travel thousands of miles just to be with you.and everybody treats me like dirt!

SCRAGGY: ( motions to crew members ) My friends also curious about where we journey to, Indy.
CLARE: Tell us all a bedtime story, Doctor
INDIANA: Long ago.a place known as the Flower Fruit Mountain, in the Chinese province of Ao-Lai.was struck by lightning. A Stone Monkey, "Sun Wu-Kung", was born.
SCRAGGY: This monkey?. He could walk?. Talk?. Like human?.
INDIANA: More than human. He was blessed with countless heavenly powers. But it wasn't enough. Sun Wu-Kung wanted to learn the secret of Eternal Life. of Immortality. Equipped with his Golden Hooped Rod to protect him, Sun Wu Kung travelled the world for many years .learning the secret philosophies and teachings of Eternal Youth. Eventually, he was granted entrance to heaven.where the Jade Emperor gave Sun Wu Kung the title of "Great Sage of the Heavens".and permitted him to oversee the Garden of Immortal Peaches. After several years, the stone monkey returned to somewhere on earth. Here, he ruled an empire.a Civilization of Monkeys and humans who had life spans of many hundred The exact whereabouts of that Lost City has been a mystery for hundreds of years.until Doctor Clarke discovered the pygmy.
INDIANA: It's uncertain just how much of this legend is based in reality. Nevertheless, we're hoping to find some sign of the Lost Civilization.
BETSY: What about Sun Wu Kung?.
INDIANA: Whatever he was.a stone idol.an actual monkey.a human being.is unknown. But he is one of the most influentual religious figures in History, and his remains are most likely somewhere in the Lost City.
INDIANA: Sound familiar?
SCRAGGY: ( shakes his head ) It is far, far away.many miles.
BETSY: ( frightened ) What is it?. Some kinda' weird No animal sounds like that.
CLARE: No animal sounds like that.
SCRAGGY: Could be "Banseebaba".
CLARE: Banseebaba is giant demon from hell. He is 50 feet tall. Breathes fire. Make sound like human never hear before. He is made up of all evil in the world!
SCRAGGY: Banseebaba is giant demon from hell. He is 50 feet tall. Breathes fire. Make sound like human never hear before. He is made up of all evil in the world!
CLARE: Cheery thought.
INDIANA: Whatever the hell it is. It went to sleep for the night. Which is what we should do.
INDIANA: is ASLEEP in his CABIN. Suddenly, the door SLOWLY CREAKS OPEN. A SHADOW appears on the cabin wall. COMING TOWARD Indiana. The shadow EXTENDS a hand. The hand GRABS Indy's blanket. Indy WAKES. He LEAPS out of bed and TACKLES the mysterious person. Indy FLIPS on the cabin lamp. The intruder is none other than.BETSY. Indiana PULLS Betsy to her feet. She gives a flirtatious SMILE.
BETSY: Couldn't sleep. The heat. I'm in the mood for passion.
INDIANA: I'm in the mood for isolation.
BETSY: I'm not leaving. Not till I get a One kiss. Or I'll scream. I swear. I'll wake the whole boat.
INDIANA: ( serious ) One kiss. Or I'll scream. I swear. I'll wake the whole boat.
BETSY: ( serious ) One kiss. Or I'll scream. I swear. I'll wake the whole boat.
INDIANA: OKay. Just one. Keep your mouth closed.
INDIANA: What's that you're writing?.
CLARE: "The Erotic Adventures Of Indiana Jones, Professor Of Perversity".
INDIANA: ( back to shaving ) Very funny.
INDIANA: has nearly finished SHAVING. He tries to CONVINCE Clare of his innocence. She continues to WRITE. IGNORING him.
INDIANA: You are blowing this Betsy thing all out of proportion.
INDIANA: It's not as if I have this sleazy
INDIANA: I am a respected.honored.
BETSY: C'mon. You ain't so tough. You wouldn't last ten minutes in
INDIANA: You son of a bitch.
INDIANA: ( still fighting ) Scraggy!. No!. Keep goin' straight!. Full steam ahead!.
SCRAGGY: is CONFUSED by Indy's orders. He SCREAMS back to Indiana.
SCRAGGY: What?. You crazy Indy?. We be crushed!. We smash into rock
INDIANA: still SWORDFIGHTING the Pirate King, SCREAMS to Scraggy.
INDIANA: No!. Trust me!. Full steam ahead!. Full steam ahead !.
SCRAGGY: BLESSES himself. His face is STRONG. CONFIDENT. He REVS the engine. FULL SPEED. He TIGHTLY CLUTCHES the wheel. AIMING the river boat toward the waterfall.
SCRAGGY: continues to rev the RIVER BOAT'S engine. CHANTING various prayers under his breath. In the background, a FEISTY Betsy continues to THE RIVER BOAT AND THE PIRATE SHIP PENETRATE the waterfall. The two boats are met with an exploding shower of POWERFUL WATER! Crew members and Pirates are TOSSED ABOUT the deck. Indiana and the Pirate King hold TIGHTLY to the sails, to AVOID being thrown into the waters below.
INDIANA: Kezure STOPS. He TURNS. Indy WALKS toward Kezure, stopping less than TEN FEET from the Pirate King and Clare. Indy's eyes BURN through Kezure LAUGHS. Indiana LIGHTS the dynamite fuses. Kezure STOPS laughing.WORRIED for a moment. Then, the Pirate King breaks into a wide, DEFIANT SMILE.
INDIANA: Free the girl. .and my friends. .or I blow your hideout here out of the water!
KEZURE: Good. We will all die.
INDIANA: We can take you to the Lost City of Sun Wu Kung!
KEZURE: Hah! Better men than you have tried to find the Lost City. They have all failed. You are a fool.
INDIANA: ( as the TNT fuse burns
LOWER.LOWER. ): No. You're the fool. You and your friends are hiding out in Sun Wu Kung's Water Curtain Cave.and you don't even know it.
KEZURE: ( puzzled, looking around )
INDIANA: The Sacred Pai-Cho Scroll.
INDIANA: Don't bother. Only WE can translate
KEZURE: The Lost City. Said to have streets paved in gold.treasures far greater than any mortal man could imagine.
KEZURE: Your pathetic lives will be spared. For now. But everything we find in the Lost City.belongs to ME.
INDIANA: Fat chance, Sinbad. It's 50-50. Or you've got no deal.
KEZURE: ( vicious smile ) It is my way. Or you've got no head.
INDIANA: Read that last proverb again.
SCRAGGY: ( reads translation ) "High tide drowns curiosity, Low tide quenches thirst".
INDIANA: ( stands, looking at the surroundings ) There's something here.something that could help us.
BETSY: Look at 'em. It's like they've never seen a woman before.
CLARE: To them. We're the ultimate women.
BETSY: Kinda' flattering, isn't it?. Being the girl of 200 guy's dreams?
INDIANA: Is there an area. A place where the tide changes?.
KEZURE: In a few hours.the water will be lower.much lower.
INDIANA: And the remainder of this wall will be visible?..
INDIANA: We're gonna need light. A lot of light. On this wall.
KEZURE: To my good fortune.
KEZURE: You know. We are very much alike, Doctor jones.
INDIANA: I doubt that.
KEZURE: We both share a remarkable talent for killing.
INDIANA: I've never gotten used to killing, pal. I do it for survival.
KEZURE: I do it for pleasure.
INDIANA: ( astounded ) This is incredible.this map was obviously used by Sun Wu Kung's disciples.if they were ever These drawings.they are of the surrounding jungle.
KEZURE: These drawings.they are of the surrounding jungle.
INDIANA: ( points to "X" ) Where is that?.
KEZURE: It is located at the most South Eastern part of the jungle.near the mountains. There is a village there. The Mongooboo Tribe.
INDIANA: You know them?
KEZURE: Very well. I traded with the chief for many years.
INDIANA: ( anxious, excited ) Good. We'll leave in the morning.
INDIANA: That sound. Again.
SCRAGGY: ( listening ) Still far away.but getting closer. The village is there. Beyond the thick of jungle.
KEZURE: The village is there. Beyond the thick of jungle.
INDIANA: Thought you said they knew you?.
INDIANA: Wait. Listen. They're not following us.
INDIANA: Be careful where you step. We've got to move slowly.very slowly.
INDIANA: Clare! What are you.?!?
CLARE: I imitated the sound of a Lion Mother calling her babies.
INDIANA: C'mon. Let's get outta'
INDIANA: Is this the Tribal Chief you told me about?. Your friend?.
KEZURE: ( points to shrunken head ) No. That is him.
KEZURE: This is a different tribe. New. They have taken over the village.
INDIANA: What happened to the other tribe?
INDIANA: You recognize their language?
SCRAGGY: I tell him we divine messengers of Sun Wu-Kung. If he interfere with our mission. Jade Emperor come down from heavens and destroy his
SCRAGGY: I tell him we lose path to city. I ask if he have something to help us.
SCRAGGY: ( translating ) He say this will help us. And since we are divine messengers.we will know how to use it!
BETSY: Indy. I'm frightened.
INDIANA: I'm claustrophobic.
INDIANA: Clare!. Wait!.
BETSY: An earthquake?
SCRAGGY: CUT TO:
CLARE: We have to get out. Or we'll be crushed to death.
INDIANA: Scraggy. How close?
SCRAGGY: Two miles.
INDIANA: Where's the softest ground?.
SCRAGGY: Oh, no! Many dead spirits! Bad spirits. We must stay away.
CLARE: That's odd. Wildebeests will not stampede unless provoked. This time, it is very close, Indy. Very close!
SCRAGGY: This time, it is very close, Indy. Very close!
OUTSIDE: Scraggy, Clare, Betsy, Kezure and the others DASH across the plains. RUNNING AWAY from the pursuing tank. But Indiana is NOT with them. Scraggy, UNABLE TO SEE through the dust, calls out.
SCRAGGY: Indy?. Indy?.
GUTTERBUHG: ( German; English subtitles )
OUTSIDE: The tank's large barrel FIRES A SHOT at the running group. The blast FLIES OVER THEIR HEADS. JUST MISSING everyone. It BLASTS a row of palm trees to smithereens. INDIANA is still running from the rampaging rhino. Indy begins to RUN IN A CIRCLE. The angry rhino FOLLOWS him. The circle begins to TIGHTEN. Becoming SMALLER. SMALLER. Until Indy is nearly running ALONGSIDE of the rhino. At the exact moment, Indy GRABS HOLD of the rhino. He LEAPS onto the beast. With a bit of careful maneuvering, Indiana is RIDING THE RHINOCEROS! Scraggy, Betsy, Clare, Kezure and the others CONTINUE TO RUN. The tank is right BEHIND THEM. MOVING FAST. In HOT PURSUIT. The tank FIRES ANOTHER SHOT! It SPLATTERS the ground. BESIDE the group. Again, JUST MISSING everyone. The group TURNS. RUNNING in ANOTHER DIRECTION. The tank FOLLOWS. Indiana continues to ride the WILD, BUCKING rhino. He has NO CONTROL over the beast. The rhino spots SOMETHING. The TANK. From this angle, the tank, with its large protruding gun barrel, resembles a GIANT RHINOCEROS. Seeing this, the rhino turns and RUNS TOWARD the tank. HEAD ON. Indy holds TIGHTLY. Scraggy and the others PAUSE. They see the tank BEHIND THEM. They see the rhino AHEAD of them. The group makes QUICK TURN. To the RIGHT. They run toward a RAVINE. The tank is headed STRAIGHT for Indy and the rhino. Both moving at

GUTTERBUHG: ( German; English subtitles ) Send help! We need assistance!
SCRAGGY: Indy in trouble! We must help!
CREW MEMBER: ( German accent ) Don't move. ( to the others ) All of you. Stay where you are.
CLARE: It was you. You're the reason the Nazis found us.
BETSY: Nobody move. Or we'll go over.
INDIANA: Jump!. Jump!.
INDIANA: Call your mommy.
INDIANA: This is Jones. I've got your tank. It's all over, pal. You lose.

INDIANA: DROPS the microphone. Suddenly WORRIED. He HURRIES out of the tank. Gutterbuhg stays BEHIND. LAUGHING.
INDIANA: We've got to move. Fast. Ask him if he knows the way to the City from here.
SCRAGGY: He do not know exact place. But it is somewhere over there.
INDIANA: A lotta' good that does us. It could take us months.years.to search everyone of those.
BETSY: Maybe he knows what to do with
SCRAGGY: It is "Magical Mirror of Sun Wu But whattayou do with it?

KEZURE: This is called "Taskipi". Only the bravest play.
BETSY: I've been talking to Dr. Clarke about our problem.
INDIANA: ( struggling with tank ) Problem?. Hey. What're you two doin' talkin' behind my back?.

SCRAGGY: ( going through pockets ) I don't have money.
KEZURE: No. No. money. Rules of the game declare that I may choose a souvenir. A part of your body. Any part I
BETSY: Dr. Clarke says that you're not really in love with me. You're just trying to prove that you can still attract younger women. You're terrified of getting old.
INDIANA: That's crazy.
BETSY: That's what I told her. I told her that you really did love me.
INDIANA: ( fumbling ) ( worried ) You mean. She was right?.
BETSY: ( worried ) You mean. She was right?.

INDIANA: Indiana pulls back his fist to PUNCH the Nazi. But Indy is STOPPED by the PALACE GUARDS. They move their SWORDS to his throat. Indy is suddenly PUZZLED. The VILLAGERS FALL TO THEIR KNEES. BOWING to Gutterbuhg. A distraught Tyki hurriedly EXPLAINS to Scraggy, who translates for Indy.
SCRAGGY: It is written. If ruler is defeated by greater power.he who possess that power. .shall become ruler!
INDIANA: This is turning into one helluva One you will never awaken from, Doctor Jones.
GUTTERBUBG: ( hears, smiles at Indy ) One you will never awaken from, Doctor Jones.

GUTTERBUHG: ( angry, slapping Indy across the face ) This is a very serious matter, Doctor Jones. It could save your ( pause ) I understand that somewhere in this City.there is a Garden of. Immortal Peaches?. ( Indy doesn't respond, Gutterbuhg continues ) I want information about this Garden. And I would greatly appreciate it, if you would share everything you know, with me.
INDIANA: I don't share anything with Nazis.
GUTTERBUHG: Very well. My friends will be here soon. They will rest.enjoy the pleasures of my newfound kingdom. Then we shall exterminate these worthless people! Destroy their City! And we will carry away all of its riches.in pieces.

INDIANA: But.well, if it wasn't for the little guy.where would this country be?. I mean.I knew this little guy once .a scrawny runt, with thick black glasses and about 300 different kinds of allergies. But this little kid had a dream. He wanted to be on the football team.

But that little guy didn't quit. Be worked hard. Never gave up. And in two years.he was the Quarterback. Star of the team. And you know why?. 'Cause that little kid had somethin' that those big guys never heard of. He had HEART! And nothin' can stop that! Nothin'! Now let's go out there and show 'em
THE FIREBALL: LANDS directly onto a speeding NAZI JEEP. The Nazis and jeep CATCH FIRE! The vehicle LOSES CONTROL. The flaming jeep CRASHES into the side of a mountain wall.

CLARE: Do exactly what I do.
CLARE: I made the sound of a baby Swandola bird, crying for help. The Mother birds immediately reply to the cries .angrily protecting their children, and murdering the baby's
SCRAGGY: You owe me, old man.
CLARE: TEARS erupt in Scraggy's eyes. He breaks down CRYING. A startled KEZURE joins the others. CAMERA PULLS BACK to an extremely LONG SHOT. The entire village GATHERS around Indiana's body. Everyone is SOLEMN.
BETSY: But. It's. It's the middle of the night.
SCRAGGY: Sun always shine in the Garden of Immortal Peaches.
KEZURE: These are the peaches that make one .forever young?.
CLARE: What does it say?.
SCRAGGY: ( translating ) "Our Lord. Our Master. Sun. Wu. Kung"
CLARE: Damn you, Jones! Why couldn't you be here to share this with me!
BETSY: Why's he speakin' in English?
CLARE: He is a heavenly being. According to legend, when a heavenly being speaks, men of all countries can understand him. We hear him in English.the pygmies hear him in their language. Return their souls!. I demand it!. Return their souls!
INDIANA: What the hell's goin' on?
CLARE: I think there is someone you should
INDIANA: You. You're. Sun Wu Kung?.
INDIANA: ( taken aback ) Huh?. You know me?
INDIANA: Well, I. Thanks I'm very honored.
KEZURE: She is a wonderful treasure. We had a deal.
INDIANA: We had a deal.
KEZURE: ( moves sword closer to Indy's throat ) I have no deals with dead men.
INDIANA: Son of a bitch.
KEZURE: ( shrugs, laughs ) I am an old Pirate, Doctor Jones. Do you suddenly expect me to treat you with kindness and fairness?. It is not my way of life!
KEZURE: Kill them. But save their hair. I will make a coat out of it.
BETSY: I thought the peaches promised immortality.eternal youth?.
INDIANA: The garden of immortal peaches promises life only to those who are pure in heart. Kezure was evil. His heart was filled with greed.
INDIANA: Where's Betsy?. The boat leaves in five minutes.
SCRAGGY: Oh, Indy! Indy! I want to give you something for your journey!
SCRAGGY: Take one drink before bed. It keep out all bad spirits. Thanks, Scraggy.

CLARE: Especially aboard ship for three weeks. It gets terribly lonely.
INDIANA: I warned you.
BETSY: Indy, I've learned a lot from you. But it's time I started concentrating on a career in anthropology.instead of romance.
INDIANA: ( sighs, to Betsy ) You've certainly developed a mature ( hugs him ) Thanks to you. ( pauses, looking into Indy's eyes ) You know. I always thought of you as my knight in shining armor.
BETSY: ( hugs him ) Thanks to you. ( pauses, looking into Indy's eyes ) You know. I always thought of you as my knight in shining armor.
INDIANA: ( flattered ) But now, I'll think of you as the Father I never had.
BETSY: But now, I'll think of you as the Father I never had.
