GPS SYSTEM: Turn right up ahead. Jennifer squints out the front windshield. The streets are all unpaved and none of them are marked with street signs.
JENNIFER: Jennifer cautiously steps inside.
JENNIFER: Jennifer walks in further, trying to not step on anything.
JENNIFER: It's fine, really. I'm Jennifer Hills. We spoke last week.
EARL: Oh, you're Miss Hills. Earl walks over to a cabinet against the wall, opens a small drawer and takes out a key.
JENNIFER: Afraid not. Earl hands her the key. Earl pulls a map with some hand-drawn arrows already on it.
EARL: Alright, listen up 'cause it's a bit These here arrows will get you through town. Over here, it's more dirt road and woods so it can get kind of dicey. We're a tad short on street signs.
JENNIFER: Well if I get lost I'll just ask for directions.
EARL: To who? Lady, the cabin is a real beaut, but heck if there ain't nothin' out there for a good country mile.
JENNIFER: ( JOKING )
EARL: Not planning on throwing a party, are ya? The security deposit.
JENNIFER: No, no. I'm looking forward to the peace and quiet. I'm a novelist. I'm starting my next book.
EARL: Alright, well, if that's what you're aimin' for, just follow that there map. Jennifer looks at the map.
JOHNNY: Didn't mean to frighten you. Johnny is good-looking in a rugged sort of way. He's sinewy, but athletic and strong. Jennifer regains her composure.
JENNIFER: No, it's fine. I'm sort of lost anyway. Looking for Mockingbird You are definitely lost.
JOHNNY: You are definitely lost.
JENNIFER: Really? I thought
JOHNNY: Nah, you sure missed it. It's a good ten miles back, left turn after the big red mailbox.
JENNIFER: Oh, okay, I think I saw that.
JOHNNY: You, uh. staying at the cabin? Jennifer hesitates for a second. Just as Jennifer opens her mouth to respond, the shrill notes of a HARMONICA shatter the silence. Jennifer turns quickly to the garage. In the garage, ANDY, one of Johnny's employees, sits on the fender of a broken down car. He holds a harmonica to his lips. He's in his mid-30's with shaggy hair and arms that look like they could bend steel. STANLEY, one of Johnny and Andy's buddies, walks up behind Andy. He's balding and overweight, and digs into a bag of pork rinds.
STANLEY: Howdy ma'am. He leans into Andy who continues playing his harp.
ANDY: I'd sop that up with a biscuit real Jennifer turns away from the garage and looks back at Johnny, who is still awaiting her answer.
JENNIFER: Uh. no. I mean yes. As she glances to the gas pump, Johnny looks her up and down. She is definitely something to look at. Johnny places his hand on the hood of the car. Glances to the guys, then back to her.
JOHNNY: You know, you're running a little hot. Want me to uh. maybe I should check under your hood? Jennifer almost laughs at the way that sounded.
JENNIFER: How's that line working for you? The gas pump clicks off interrupting. But Johnny just stands there looking at her.
JOHNNY: I don't know, how's it working for Johnny saunters over to the pump and in a phallic manner, pulls the pump out. It gets laughs from the peanut gallery. Jennifer looks away, a line has been crossed. She looks to the pump again. $19.78.
JENNIFER: Let me just. Jennifer fumbles into her purse when the map falls from her I'll get that.
JOHNNY: I'll get that.
JENNIFER: No I got it Johnny gets uncomfortably close to Jennifer at the rear door of the car when HONK HONK HONK - The SUV's deafening alarm blares out. Johnny's startled, stumbles backwards, trips and goes sprawling to the ground. Jennifer, controlling laughter, holds up her keys and clicks the alarm off. Johnny is covered in dust and oil, struggling to get to his feet while maintaining a shred of dignity. Jennifer Sorry. I accidentally hit the panic button. Are you okay?
JOHNNY: I'm fine. Johnny looks away, angry. He's certainly not the type of guy who can laugh at himself easily, if at all. From the garage, Stanley and Andy point at him and guffaw.
ANDY: ( from the garage ) Hey! You better check your underwear, Johnny. Stanley smiles and elbows Andy, but his mouth is too full with pork rinds to actually laugh.
STANLEY: Yea. Check um' for skidmarks. Johnny shoots him a harsh look. Jennifer hands Johnny a twenty. Trying to contain her ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 6A. Sure you okay? Johnny's eyes are cold, his face red.
JENNIFER: Sure you okay? Johnny's eyes are cold, his face red.
JOHNNY: I said I was fine. Suddenly, Jennifer grows uneasy. She smiles uncomfortably, gets in the car and drives away. Johnny takes a bandana from his pocket and wipes his brow. He watches Jennifer's car disappear and spits on the ground as the laughter escalates in her absence. Johnny spins.
WRITING: A10 INT. CABIN - DAY A10 CLOSE ON: Words fly across the screen as Jennifer types at a furious pace. Blocks of text keep scrolling away. Her fingers effortlessly swipe away at key after key, a writer's high if you will. Finally an exclamation point is stabbed with emphasis. Then she hears a sound off in the trees. She looks out and hears a very distant few notes of a harmonica. Then a few even more distant "heeeeeeweeeee". After a beat she innocently smiles figuring it's just some boys off in the distance having a party or something. Jennifer leans back, smiles briefly and pour herself a glass of wine.
JENNIFER: ( INTO PHONE ) JENNIFER ( CONT'D )
SHED. SLAM!: The SHED DOOR is kicking open and closed in the breeze. She makes her way towards the shed. All EXT. CABIN, SHED - DUSK All Jennifer gets to the shed. The door is wide open. She steps B11 INT. CABIN, SHED - DUSK B11 Inside there is an array of old gardening tools. Pots, garbage cans. Some different chemical bottles including a jug of LYE. Jennifer thinks she hears something from deep inside the shed. She moves in further as
SLAM!: The door shuts behind her -
JENNIFER: C11 EXT. CABIN, SHED - DUSK C11 Jennifer exits, and securely closes the shed door. After a beat she smirks at the thought that she thought this was more than just a door blowing in the wind, then heads back to the D12 EXT. CABIN, FRONT PORCH -DUSK D12 Jennifer walks up to the chair, moves her laptop, sits and then as she grabs her phone she knocks the glass of wine off the arm of the chair into her lap.
JENNIFER: Ohhhhh. You gotta be kidding. She get up, looks at the red wine stain all over her lap, and picks up her things to heads in the cabin.
JENNIFER: The spray only lasts a few seconds before sputtering out. However, then the toilet starts to GURGLE. Jennifer lifts the lid up with her foot. The toilet water bubbles up and then disappears down the drain.
JENNIFER: ( LISTENS INTENTLY )
MATTHEW: P1. please! I. I came to fix the plumbing.
JENNIFER: ( FRIENDLY )
JENNIFER: Is this gonna take much longer?
MATTHEW: ( muffled, under the sink ) N.not much.
JENNIFER: So what's wrong with it?
MATTHEW: Uh. it's just older pipes. Matthew continues his work, you can tell he is uncomfortable with the conversation.
JENNIFER: So do you live around here?
MATTHEW: No.no one lives around here.
JENNIFER: Yeah, I kind of get that. I meant in town? Matthew comes out from under the sink. He snaps nerviously at one of the rubber bands on his wrist.
MATTHEW: My. my whole life. Jennifer looks to his wrist. It's all red. Matthew turns on the faucet. Out comes a hard stream of cold, clear water. He flushes the toilet and then turns on the shower to the same result.
JENNIFER: Thank you! Matthew blushes furiously and fumbles his tools as he packs up. For him, the kiss was more embarrassing than enjoyable.
STANLEY: Ground rule double.
ANDY: ( ANGRILY )
STANLEY: Fine. Maybe a triple. But that's it. You got to knock the guts out its mouth to score a run.
ANDY: Would you turn that thing off? Gonna get us in trouble with that human society.
JOHNNY: Humane you dipshit. Johnny site in a chair holding his fishing rod between his knees. A cigarette dangles from his mouth and a beer is perpetually glued to his hand.
ANDY: I told you. This thing is going to make me a fortune. All you got to do is film something crazy, then you send it into the internet, make a killing.
STANLEY: I told you. This thing is going to make me a fortune. All you got to do is film something crazy, then you send it into the internet, make a killing.
ANDY: No one's gonna pay you for that It's the hits, Andy. You just gotta get the hits.
STANLEY: It's the hits, Andy. You just gotta get the hits.
JOHNNY: Hits my ass, now you two retards gonna fish or what? Matthew comes crashing out of the foliage, knocks over the cooler spilling ice and beer all over.
ANDY: Speaking of retards.
MATTHEW: Q..Quit it Andy.
JOHNNY: Alright. Now we're all here, what's the big show, Stanley?
STANELY: The big show is this Stanley holds up the video camera like a trophy.
ANDY: Are you kidding me? That shit? What'd you do? Film yourself lighting a fart?
STANELY: Johnny just shakes his head.
JOHNNY: ( TO HIMSELF )
STANLEY: I got Matthew's girlfriend in a private moment.
ANDY: What do you mean like on the toilet or something? Stanley pulls a tape out of his pocket and loads it.
STANLEY: Not true, my friends. And the evidence is right here.
MATTHEW: What are you ta. talking 'bout Yeah, what are you talking about?
ANDY: Yeah, what are you talking about?
STANLEY: He had that babe from the city all alone and he didn't even try to nail her.
JOHNNY: What babe from the city?
STANLEY: You know, the one who stopped for gas the other day. The one who dumped you on your can. She had Matty here fixing her pipes.
JOHNNY: Matthew snaps the rubber band more. Johnny turns quickly to Cut that shit homo! How many times I gotta tell you. Stanley gets the camera ready.
STANLEY: She even gave him a kiss for "servicing her." Look, here's Matthew running from the cabin like a schoolgirl. They all gather around. POV CAMERA: Matthew runs from the cabin, dropping tools as he goes. Jennifer stands in the doorway calling after him. The camera goes closer on Jennifer The guys break up. Johnny is a bit more serious.
ANDY: Now that's some fine camera work, even better than the time you filmed yo' self hangin' your nana's What's this about a kiss?
JOHNNY: What's this about a kiss?
STANLEY: Matthew here says she gave him a kiss right on the cheek.
JOHNNY: No, she did Johnny. She kissed me.
MATTHEW: No, she did Johnny. She kissed me.
JOHNNY: Don't lie to me dipshit.
STANELY: If you all don't shut the hell up you'll miss the encore. All eyes turn to Stanley as Stanley pushes some buttons on the MINIDV cam. Andy comes over and looks at the LCD screen.
STANLEY: Get ready for it. ON MINIDV: The footage that Stanley shot is obviously the previous night through Jennifer's kitchen window.
ANDY: I'll be. Look at the rack on that Andy punches Stanley in the arm. Johnny just stares at the You dirty dog. Where the hell'd you get that?
STANLEY: I've been working nights.
ANDY: Sure is something to look at. Matthew is clearly uncomfortable, but he desperately needs to be one of the guys.
MATTHEW: Yeah, and she likes me. she was nice to me. Stretching a rubber band.
ANDY: Nice? To her, you're nothing but a shitter fixer. Hell, she wouldn't even give Johnny the time of day. Johnny snaps his head up and looks at Stanley.
JOHNNY: Bullshit. I could tame that ass if I wanted to.
ANDY: You saw her Johnny. stuck up city ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 18A. Yea, girls like that think you're hardly good enough to pump their Johnny lights up another cigarette. He points at Andy.
STANLEY: Yea, girls like that think you're hardly good enough to pump their Johnny lights up another cigarette. He points at Andy.
JOHNNY: Let me tell you something. I had her creaming in her panties.
ANDY: And she had you shitting yours. Least her car alarm did. The guys yuck it up.
JOHNNY: ( SEETHING )
MATTHEW: Nah. She's not like that, Johnny. Johnny snorts, condescendingly.
JOHNNY: How do you know, ya fuckin' virgin? Let me tell you something. They're all like that! Fucking big city cock-teasing whore is all she is. He flicks his cigarette and it sizzles out in the water. Then he gets right up in Matthew's face.
JENNIFER: Silence. Jennifer rises up on her toes and looks out the glass window of the front door. The porch is deserted. Jennifer opens the door slowly.
JOHNNY: Nice shot huh? Jennifer shrieks and spins around only to find Standing there, right inside the front door, is Johnny. He Johnny shrugs calmly and continues milling about the room. Jennifer spins around, looking for a way out.
STANLEY: Smile real pretty for the camera.
JENNIFER: ( her voice cracking ) Get out of here. Get out of here right now!
JOHNNY: Now that's not very hospitable, is Then, the wooden stairs creak under Andy's steps as he walks down around his chest is one of Jennifer's bra stretched to the limit. He's twirling a thong panty on his finger. The guys get a good laugh at Andy.
JENNIFER: All of you better get out of here. I called the police. Johnny nods. He looks at her, his gaze mocking.
JOHNNY: You called the police? Or you will call the police?
JENNIFER: I. I called them already. They're on their way right now!
JOHNNY: With what phone? Matthew said you dropped it in the drink. Jennifer doesn't answer.
STANLEY: Matthew, get your boney ass in Shortly after, Matthew shuffles inside. He can't even bring himself to look at Jennifer.
JOHNNY: ( TO JENNIFER )
JENNIFER: That is just not true! I tried to. He ran out. ( to Matthew ) Is that what you said? Matthew winces and starts to snap a rubber band on his wrist. as Jennifer walks over to her purse.
JOHNNY: Let's not worry about that right Johnny hops up on the kitchen counter, cutting her off with his leg. He then picks up the bottle of vodka, takes a swig.
JENNIFER: I'm writing. I'm a Writer. But my boyfriend is coming up. He'll actually be here any minute
JOHNNY: That right? The guys give a good chuckle-
STANLEY: Yeah, yeah. Date night.
ANDY: ( CHUCKLING )
JOHNNY: You know what I think. I think you're lying. There's no boyfriend. No man in his right mind would leave a girl like you all up here on your own.
JENNIFER: ( EMPHATIC )
JOHNNY: Yeah, well so will Santi Clause. Andy and Stanley are loving every minute of this. Matthew leans against the wall, his eyes on the floor.
JENNIFER: No, look. I have the money Andy slingshots the thong right at Jennifer. It lands at her What's a matter? Too good to drink with us?
JOHNNY: What's a matter? Too good to drink with us?
JENNIFER: Please, I don't want to. Johnny raises his eyebrows. The bottle is partially empty.
JOHNNY: ( TO JENNIFER ) ( TO OTHERS )
JENNIFER: I didn't say that. Andy walks over and sits down at her desk, clicks around the screen, begins reading aloud from the text.
ANDY: ( READING ) ( THEN )
JENNIFER: Can you all please leave me alone?! Meanwhile, Stanley putters around the kitchen, opening and closing the cabinet doors, knocking stuff around. He finds a pack of rice cakes. He shoves one in his mouth, winces, spits it out.
STANLEY: Damned cardboard. You eat this You should! Do you some good. Andy turns from the desk, strikes a match and flicks it at Look, can you just tell me what you want? What do you want? I offered you money. Johnny stubbornly holds out the bottle of vodka. Andy giggles. He finds this quite funny.
ANDY: You should! Do you some good. Andy turns from the desk, strikes a match and flicks it at Look, can you just tell me what you want? What do you want? I offered you money. Johnny stubbornly holds out the bottle of vodka. Andy giggles. He finds this quite funny.
JENNIFER: Look, can you just tell me what you want? What do you want? I offered you money. Johnny stubbornly holds out the bottle of vodka. Andy giggles. He finds this quite funny.
JOHNNY: ( EXTENDING BOTTLE )
JENNIFER: Fine, if you'll leave I'll take a Jennifer studies the bottle and finally accepts it. Drinks a small sip. They all start booing.
JOHNNY: Come on. You can do better than that. I bet when you're out there with your city friends you can throw 'em back with the best of them.
JENNIFER: I took the drink, now you
JOHNNY: I said drink it! Jennifer grows increasingly nervous and reluctantly takes a nice swig. Then chokes and gags. They all cheer.
JENNIFER: Look, I'm sorry if I embarrassed you the other day, but we're even now, right? Okay. Please. Leave. Andy and Stanley plop themselves down on the couch and prop their feet up on the wood and glass coffee table.
JOHNNY: Oh. that's not what this is Then what is this about? Johnny jumps down from the counter. He stands in front of Jennifer, towering over her.
JENNIFER: Then what is this about? Johnny jumps down from the counter. He stands in front of Jennifer, towering over her.
JOHNNY: I want to see your teeth. As if the air is sucked out of the room. Jennifer stares at him, not even sure she heard him correctly. Matthew snaps the rubber band harder. He moves to the far corner of the room and tucks himself against the wall.
JENNIFER: Wha. what?
JOHNNY: You heard me, show Horse. Show me your teeth.
JENNIFER: That's. I'm not going to. please leave.
JOHNNY: ( quiet, but firm ) Show the teeth. Andy walks over and hands Johnny the small wooden bat he used to kill the fish. Johnny smacks it against his palm.
JENNIFER: Now please. I'm begging you. Johnny slides off the counter.
JOHNNY: Uh, uh. Again. Jennifer reinserts her fingers and pulls. Johnny reaches into her mouth and grabs a hold of her two front teeth with his thumb and forefinger.
ANDY: My turn.
STANLEY: Come on, let Matthew have a go. It's his girlfriend and he hasn't even wet his whistle yet.
MATTHEW: I.I ddd.don't want to. Johnny walks up to Matthew, angrily, and slaps him across the face. He points to Jennifer.
JOHNNY: What do you mean you don't want to?
ANDY: Aw, fuck it. I ain't waiting. Andy grabs the VODKA BOTTLE. He walks over to Jennifer, still on her knees, and positions the bottle right in front of his crotch.
FIGURE: Whoa, whoa, whoa there. Easy The Figure extends his hand. As Jennifer reaches for it, she sees his jacket pull away from his chest, revealing a silver badge. She's found SHERIFF STORCH, a small town sheriff with a small town charm that can easily be confused as smarmy.
JENNIFER: Help me. Please! Standing next to the Sheriff, also holding a hunting rifle, is Earl. Earl looks over at the Sheriff.
SHERIFF STORCH: Okay, okay, I gotcha. The Sheriff helps Jennifer to her feet.
EARL: I know this one. She rented the place down on Mockingbird Trail.
JENNIFER: I was assaulted! They broke into the cabin! They had a gun- Jennifer breaks down again.
SHERIFF STORCH: Ma'am, please, you have to calm But Jennifer is hysterical, desperately holding back tears.
JENNIFER: In my mouth! He put a gun in my mouth! You don't understand.
SHERIFF STORCH: Ma'am, It's okay. I'm the Sheriff. You need to take a deep breath and tell me what happened. Jennifer forces herself to take a deep breath and manages to pull herself together.
JENNIFER: Four men. It was four of them. They broke into my cabin. They assaulted me! Earl just watches not knowing what to do.
SHERIFF STORCH: Are you hurt? Do you need a Jennifer shakes her head.
JENNIFER: Yes, I'd seen them before.
SHERIFF STORCH: Around here?
JENNIFER: At the service station right outside of town. They work there.
SHERIFF STORCH: ( TO EARL )
JENNIFER: Yes. They called him Johnny. There was a heavy set guy too
AND: Sheriff Storch shakes his head and rolls his eyes.
SHERIFF STORCH: Sounds like them boys been up to no good. Alright Earl. You best head on back. Me and Miss.
JENNIFER: Hills. Jennifer Hills.
SHERIFF STORCH: Me and Miss Hills are gonna head on over to the cabin and straighten 'em out.
SHERIFF STORCH: ( BEAT )
SHERIFF STORCH: You here alone?
JENNIFER: SHERIFF STORCH ( RE: LIQUOR )
SHERIFF STORCH: ( RE: LIQUOR )
JENNIFER: I wasn't going to drink it all this weekend. I. I planned on being here for a couple of months.
SHERIFF STORCH: Drink some tonight?
JENNIFER: Yes, well, they were. They forced me to. He moves away and walks back through the cabin. As he does, he spots the glass shattered on the floor. and the nearby THONG and BRA that Andy flung at her. Takes a long hard look at them, then looks back up to One of them, he was up there, went through everything.
SHERIFF STORCH: ( pointing to the glass ) They do this, too?
JENNIFER: Please, I don't care about those things. They shoved a gun in my Jennifer breaks down again as the Sheriff moves toward her.
SHERIFF STORCH: Okay, okay Ma'am. It's okay now. Them boys are gone. You're safe Jennifer nods to him, still shaken. Storch looks to the lock on the back door. He walks toward the back door and turns the dead bolt back and forth.
JENNIFER: Yes. Of course.
SHERIFF STORCH: How long you been here?
JENNIFER: Just a few days.
SHERIFF STORCH: Anything strange happen before this? You have a run in with any of these guys?
JENNIFER: No. Not really. I stopped for gas and directions.
SHERIFF STORCH: Ma'am, is this your marijuana go over in this small town like it does in Manhattan.
JENNIFER: Uh. n.no. The men probably left it. Sheriff Storch walks over to Jennifer until he's standing directly in front of her.
SHERIFF STORCH: You mean to tell me that one of these guys was wearing lipstick? Storch holds up the roach. Jennifer notices the lipstick smear on the rolling paper. She casts her eyes downward.
JENNIFER: Please, I swear. I didn't make it up. I may have smoked a joint, but- Sheriff Storch lifts his walkie-talkie to his mouth.
SHERIFF STORCH: ( into the walkie-talkie ) This is Sheriff Storch. I'm at the Mockingbird Cabin. I gonna need some backup. The words out of the Sheriff's mouth seem almost surreal.
JENNIFER: ( BECOMING FRANTIC )
SHERIFF STORCH: Ma'am. You've been drinking and smoking marijuana, and you got enough alcohol here to put our whole town three sheets to the wind. You're running around in your nighty at the crack of dawn. You need to see this from my point of view.
JENNIFER: What?! They were here! They assaulted me! You've got to believe me!
SHERIFF STORCH: I just want to get to the bottom of it. You're making serious accusations bout' boys I've know since they was kids, and you haven't been all together truthful now have you?
SHERIFF STORCH: ( MOCK SURPIRSE ) ( TO JENNIFER )
JENNIFER: Show him those teeth, Show Horse.
JOHNNY: Show him those teeth, Show Horse.
SHERIFF STORCH: With her top lip forced up by the barrel of the shotgun, Jennifer can only make a GRUNTING noise. Sheriff Storch takes the shotgun out of Jennifer's mouth and places it flush against the side of her head. He pushes her to the floor. Jennifer lets out a YELP as she falls.
STANLEY: Oh, man. Oh, man.
SHERIFF STORCH: ( TO JENNIFER )
JOHNNY: Keep whinnying! Jennifer looks up at Sheriff Storch with pleading eyes. Sheriff Storch picks her up by her hair but Jennifer comes up swinging connecting with the Sheriff's face. The slightest scratch across his lip. Sheriff Storch turns beet red. He backhands her across the face sending her back down to the floor. A thin line of blood flows from her nose. The Sheriff looks over to Johnny, licks his lip and nods his head.
SHERIFF STORCH: Think you outta tame this little mare of yours. Johnny takes the Sheriff's lead.
JOHNNY: Alright, come on, Show Horse. Get up. Or you won't get a sugar cube. Jennifer struggles to her feet. She stands in front of them, defenseless. Johnny grabs her hair and pulls her head far back. She lets out a half-moan.
STANLEY: Come on, Matthew. You want to talk the talk, then walk the walk, you Johnny flicks open a pocket knife. He tickles Jennifer's bottom lip with the blade, then gently runs it down her chin, past her neck, and between her breasts, just before stopping at the waistband, then he slices the waistband of her pants - her pants drop to the floor.
JOHNNY: ( TO MATTHEW )
STANLEY: Matthew, what the hell? It's not even hard! Matthew sweats profusely.
SHERIFF STORCH: Well, maybe it's not totally his fault. After all, she's not doing much to get his motor running. Sheriff Storch looks back to Jennifer.
JOHNNY: Come on. Move that rear of your's Show Horse. Prance for us. Sheriff Storch stalks around her, taking it all in, then he walks back in closer to her, in her face.
SHERIFF STORCH: You dance like that in those city Jennifer closes her eyes. Tears stream down her face.
STANLEY: She dance like that they'd throw her butt to the curb.
JOHNNY: Prance like you mean it. Like you do when you want to get laid. With a swift, hard backhand, Sheriff Storch smacks her ass and hard.
ANDY: That'll get her moving. The guys hoot and holler. Except for Matthew, who looks as if he too is about to cry.
MATTHEW: Ok..kkay, I'll d.do it. Matthew walks slowly over to Jennifer. With no warning, Matthew takes Jennifer's face in his hands and kisses her. The men HOWL with sadistic glee. Jennifer slaps him right across the face, then she tries to run but Sheriff Storch forces her to the ground. He walks up to Don't waste my time you thickheaded ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 42. Johnny pushes Matthew down on top of her. Jennifer instinctively swings and connects with Matthew's face - He recoils in pain - but the guys cheer him on as they decide to help him out. Andy tears open her shirt, Johnny yanks down her panties. Jennifer claws and kicks at all of them as she desperately tries to fight him off.

SHERIFF STORCH: ( INTO PHONE )
SHERIFF STORCH: ( INTO PHONE )
SHERIFF STORCH: ( INTO PHONE )
JOHNNY: Jesus, Matthew. You're getting your ass whooped by a girl! Matthew snaps: He wraps his hands around her neck and begins pumping away like a lunatic. For some reason, the anger allows him to perform. Jennifer struggles to breathe. Luckily, before all oxygen to her brain is cut off, Matthew stops. He SCREAMS as he finishes. His hands fall from her neck as he collapses on top of her. The MEN all cheer as Matthew staggers to his feet weak. He looks like he could throw up and he does - right off to the side as the others just lose it! Jennifer curls herself into a ball and SOBS.
SHERIFF STORCH: ( TO MATTHEW )
JOHNNY: ( TO STANLEY )
STANLEY: Make her do it.
JOHNNY: ( ANGRILY )
STANLEY: You ever get mace in your eyes, bitch? It smarts.
JOHNNY: Alright. This filly's got a few more races to run Sheriff Storch approaches Jennifer. Although she can't even turn around, she senses their presence. Storch gets down into her face.
SHERIFF STORCH: I hope you got some fight left in you. I like it rough.
JENNIFER: ( BARELY AUDIBLE )
SHERIFF STORCH: Not to worry Darlin'. I'm an ass Sheriff Storch takes off his belt and unbuckles his pants. He kneels down behind her.. Jennifer SHRIEKS as her face contorts with a completely new level of pain as her head is thrust back down. Then, out of the corner of her eye, Jennifer catches a glimpse of the Sheriff's GUN, still sitting in its holster. Her eyes immediately go to Stanley who's busy swapping out the MINI-DV tape and replacing it with a new one Then she sees Matthew leaning against a tree, a vacant look in his eye twisting a rubber band through his fingers. Andy site on is ass, playing his harmonica. Her eyes continue to scan the area for Johnny who's nowhere in sight. Then immediately her eyes dart back to the GUN.
JOHNNY: No teeth Show Horse. No teeth. Her vision grows hazy. The sky, water, and ground all seem to meld together.
ANDY: Wow, Stanley, 30 seconds. Must be a record for you.
JOHNNY: Don't you know you should wait for the lady?
STANLEY: Bitch was too tight, even after ya'll. Sides, she's all bloody. I wanted to finish up.
ANDY: Right and we thought Matthew here was gonna be the pussy.
JOHNNY: Don't be so proud of yourself Andy. I clocked you at just over two Jennifer musters up her last ounce of strength and gets to her feet. The men all stare, impressed at her resolve. Jennifer's torn clothes hang loosely off her body as she staggers away and wanders aimlessly away from them. It's a miracle she can even walk. She continues until the forest ends and she comes upon a
SHERIFF STORCH: Sorry. it was fun while it lasted.
JOHNNY: Yeah, too bad we have to put you down, Show Horse. in a final act of defiance, Jennifer falls back off the bridge and into the murky, moving water. immediately, the men rush to the edge of the bridge. The Sheriff's gun cocked and ready Tracking down the water - Not a sign. They all look down, waiting, still nothing.
STANLEY: Where'd she go?
ANDY: She's gotta come up for air Current's got her. Shit, in her condition she's already drowned. Johnny looks to the Sheriff who's gun is trained on the water waiting for something. anything.
STANLEY: Current's got her. Shit, in her condition she's already drowned. Johnny looks to the Sheriff who's gun is trained on the water waiting for something. anything.
JOHNNY: Sheriff Storch pulls back his gun, and adjusts his hat, deep in thought.
SHERIFF STORCH: All you get your butts down there, check under the bridge, both banks, in the trees right now. They all look at him.
ANDY: I ain't got my waders.
SHERIFF STORCH: I said right fuekin' now before I throw you over!
JOHNNY: SHERIFF STORCH ( BEAT )
SHERIFF STORCH: Listen up. 'Bout six miles downstream the creek ends in Hendersonville. somewhere between here and there we're gonna find her. We split up. We check the banks, in the timber, under a rock, hell if you see a hole big enough for a rat I want it checked out. And don't stop 'til you find me a Don't just stand there, get!
STANLEY: ( EXASPERATED )
SHERIFF STORCH: ( PURE RAGE )
MATTHEW: She slipped and fell! Matthew stands up, nervous, jittery, coming unglued.
SHERIFF STORCH: Can someone get this dipshit outta my face! I don't need none of you screwing the pooch on this, least of all numbnuts over there. Sheriff Storch lets go of Stanley's collar and gives it a quick pat, almost like an imperceptible apology for his SHERIFF STORCH ( CONT'D ) Now let's move. find me a body!
ANDY: Nothing. Not a damn thing.
JOHNNY: Well, what now? Storch takes another look down the river, scanning it.
SHERIFF STORCH: The body'll turn up. One way or another. Every day we check the ravine, from the bridge, straight through down here, then back. Two shifts a day until we find something. 'Cause with no body, you're all as fucked as she is.
STANLEY: For how long?
SHERIFF STORCH: 'Til I say! Okay?! Andy, you go back to the cabin and get rid of her shit. All of it! Burn it. And we need to sanitize that place something good. I don't want so much as a stray hair left.
JOHNNY: I'll buff out the serial numbers too. Sell the parts at salvage. Storch nods in approval as his eyes wander to the camera.
SHERIFF STORCH: .and give me that. Sheriff Storch rips the camera from Stanley's hands. He pulls out the tape. He throws the tape to the ground and stomps on it, smashing it to bits. Stanley opens his mouth to say something, thinks better of it, and closes it quickly.
ANDY: So that's everything. Right down to her little tit sling.
JOHNNY: And there was no trace at all? Nothing in the woods? In the Andy shakes his head. Stanley rubs his eyes hard.
STANLEY: I'm starving, man.
JOHNNY: Well ain't that the headline. Soon as we finish this and haul her car into the garage, you can stuff your face 'til you puke.
ANDY: Idiot wanted to stay there. He was walking around in the water, looking for her like some crazed dog after a bone.
JOHNNY: Jesus Christ. He's not playing with a full deck as it is.
MRS. STORCH: Gone all day. I got nervous. Anything worth telling?
CHASTITY: Daddy! Daddy! Sheriff Storch picks up his daughter and kisses her head.
SHERIFF STORCH: Just the usual, domestic dispute out near Clifton. Took forever.
MRS. STORCH: Sure. I'll reheat it.
SHERIFF STORCH: Oh yeah, what am I gonna be proud ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 52. I was accepted to the honors program, daddy. can you believe Sheriff puts her down. Proud.
CHASTITY: I was accepted to the honors program, daddy. can you believe Sheriff puts her down. Proud.
SHERIFF STORCH: Of course I can. I expect nothing less from my Angel.
SHERIFF STORCH: Every time I come in here this place gets worse. Earl's bent over one of the tanks, elbow-deep in fetid water.
EARL: Yeah, but business gets better. That's the trade off.
SHERIFF STORCH: Yeah, well, you're lucky I don't cite you for being a public health Sheriff Storch reaches into his pocket and pulls out a set of keys. He holds them in the air and JINGLES them. Earl finally looks up, confused.
EARL: Mockingbird Trail, what? Oh, right, Miss Hills. What happened? She left?
SHERIFF STORCH: Yeah, I couldn't make heads or tails of it. Found marijuana cigarettes, case of booze, looked to me like she was a party girl. a very wild one.

SHERIFF STORCH: Nah, place is fine. She packed up and split.
EARL: My lucky day.
SHERIFF STORCH: Why's that?
EARL: No refund policy.
SHERIFF STORCH: Christmas come early. Enjoy it.
EARL: ( changes the subject ) Speaking of early, only a month 'til quail season. Don't know about you but I'm getting tired of shooting squirrels.
SHERIFF STORCH: Me too.
ANDY: ( from under the car ) Round up some tail out there?
JOHNNY: Maybe. Guarantee you they'll be Johnny looks up as Stanley stumbles into the garage, holding a six pack of beer.
STANLEY: It's happy hour.
ANDY: Fucking A. Johnny cracks open the beer and takes a gulp. He wipes the back of his hand across his mouth.
JOHNNY: ( TO STANLEY )
STANLEY: Just figured we deserved a break. Andy holds up his beer in a mock toast.
ANDY: To your moma. Johnny points to Andy, his beer still in his hand.
JOHNNY: Just one, you hear me? Don't need you passing out on your watch you Andy takes a large sip.
ANDY: Heck, just let Matthew take all the shifts. He's been down there everyday anyway. Even when it's not his turn. They all look to one another.
JOHNNY: The fuck's he doing down there?
ANDY: I don't know. Last time I saw him, he wasn't lookin' too good. Maybe we should give him a break. Pull him off all together.
STANLEY: Bullshit. It's been over two weeks. I'm tired of searching. If she didn't turn up yet, she ain't You'll keep lookin' till I tell ya' to stop.
JOHNNY: You'll keep lookin' till I tell ya' to stop.
JENNIFER: Matthew is paralyzed with fear, he tries to turn as a grizzly, decayed hand grabs his forehead. Another grabs hold of his throat. A mouth caked with dirt and dried blood begins to kiss up his neck, his face- Matthew screams wildly
MRS. STORCH: ( INTO PHONE )
SHERIFF STORCH: 60 INT. EARL'S PLACE NIGHT 60 Earl fidgets with his tanks, cleaning, scraping algae. But you can tell he's nervous about something.
EARL: Yeah, so, this woman leaves a message on the machine. Barbara something or other.
SHERIFF STORCH: Yeah, so.
EARL: She was looking for that Miss Hills. Says no one's seen her in over a month. Ain't that about when she split?
SHERIFF STORCH: Yeah, and. you know the story.
EARL: I don't know. I wasn't there. I think you should call her back. I mean heck, sheriff, you may have been the last person to see her. The Sheriff's blood starts to boil, he wants to say more, but looks to his wife. then controls himself.
SHERIFF STORCH: Okay. I'll give her a call.
EARL: Good. You want the number?
SHERIFF STORCH: Nah, It's late. I'll pick it up from you in the am. We're still on for tomorrow, right?
EARL: Yeah, of course. Sheriff Storch hangs up. Mrs. Storch looks up.
MRS. STORCH: Is everything okay?
SHERIFF STORCH: Just fine.
SHERIFF STORCH: Can you believe there used to be a limit on quail? Goddamn things are like locust now.
EARL: Much to our good fortune. Earl points to a nearby log.
SHERIFF STORCH: You're getting old, Earl. I remember back when you and my old man chased that buck out of the hollows on Stickler's Farm before bagging it.
EARL: ( LAUGHS )
SHERIFF STORCH: Here's to the good of days. Earl looks at him, surprised.
EARL: ( RE: BOTTLE )
SHERIFF STORCH: And funerals. BLAM: Earl's chest erupts in a geyser of blood. Earl drops to the ground like a rag doll. The bottle falls from his grasp. The whisky flows into the dirt. Sheriff Storch stands up, clutching his smoking shotgun.
ANDY: Jeez look at this.
JOHNNY: Something's spooked the cattle.
STANLEY: It's gone! It's fucking gone] Stanley storms into the garage.
ANDY: Jesus, Stanley. Calm down.
JOHNNY: What the hell's got your nuts tied in a sling? Stanley is completely out of breath.
STANLEY: It's gone. My camera. It's gone! Andy looks at him, visibly annoyed.
ANDY: Maybe you accidentally ate it?
STANLEY: Fuck off, this is serious! Johnny shakes his head.
JOHNNY: The hell you talking about?
STANLEY: The tape, Johnny. The goddamn Wait a minute. You mean the one Storch smashed to bits. That tape?
JOHNNY: Wait a minute. You mean the one Storch smashed to bits. That tape?
STANLEY: He didn't smash shit. I put in a new one. Sheriff stomped the one with nothing on it.
JOHNNY: You stupid retard piece of shit. You tellin' me you kept the tape? Johnny grabs Stanley by the neck and slams him up against a car, and begins to Strangle the life out of him.
STANLEY: ( struggling to breathe ) I. don't. please i Aaq 'caH
JOHNNY: You're too dumb to know how dumb you are. Where's the fuckin' ( struggling to breathe ) I had it. Now it's gone.
STANLEY: ( struggling to breathe ) I had it. Now it's gone.
ANDY: Was ya robbed? Or did you leave it It was in my place. I swear it.
STANLEY: It was in my place. I swear it.
JOHNNY: Who else knew about it? A beat of silence hangs in theair.
STANLEY: Matthew. I showed it to him. Off all their incredulous looks.
JOHNNY: The kid's barely got one oar in the water and you just took it and shoved it up his ass. Andy walks by Stanley and slaps him in the head for good Unfreakin' real. Do you understand the world of shit we are all in right now.Do you?!
STANLEY: You can't tell him Johnny. You Johnny ponders for a second.
ANDY: Shit for brains here's right. We gotta stick together now.
STANLEY: Please, Johnny. He finds out about this. that I had the tape-
JOHNNY: No. no. We don't breathe a word of this. ( points to them both ) Not a damn word. Sheriff gets wind of this, we'll all be having "hunting accidents": We clear? Johnny slaps Stanley in the head again for good measure.
JOHNNY: No answer at the door. Johnny groans and gets off the couch, annoyed at being disturbed. He walks over to the front door and yanks it open. The front porch is empty. Just as he's about to close the door, he glances down. There's a dead bird on the stoop. Johnny narrows his eyes and looks out into the night. Then he closes the door and returns to the couch.
JOHNNY: ( THREATENING )
JOHNNY: Got dammit! This time, Johnny races to the door and yanks it open, cocking the gun on the way and fires into the night.
JOHNNY: ( UNDER BREATH )
SHERIFF STORCH: Within seconds, Mrs. Storch materializes, apron on and wiping her hands on a dish towel.
MRS. STORCH: Oh, they're beautiful. Sheriff Storch walks over and gives her a kiss on the cheek.
SHERIFF STORCH: I've been
MRS. STORCH: No need to explain. You just buried your close friend. And you haven't taken a single day off. You're only human.
SHERIFF STORCH: I guess.
MRS. STORCH: Hey, maybe you can help me while I put these in water.
SHERIFF STORCH: Help with what?
MRS. STORCH: We got this tape delivered it don't fit our machine.
SHERIFF STORCH: What tape?
MRS. STORCH: it came this morning. But as Storch looks over the tape, the color, the markings. no, it couldn't be, he smashed that tape.
SHERIFF STORCH: Did Chastity see this?
MRS. STORCH: No, like I said, we couldn't get it to play.
SHERIFF STORCH: Where is she?
MRS. STORCH: Sleeping, why? Storch wipes his face with his hand, then shoves the tape into his shirt pocket.
SHERIFF STORCH: I'll. I'll be back. Sheriff Storch quickly turns away from his wife and hurries out the door. Mrs. Storch stands at the door and watches with growing curiosity as the cruiser peels out of the driveway, a cloud of dust in its wake.
ANDY: So what's all this about, Johnny? Johnny takes out Jennifer's shoe and throws it at them. They both dodge a hit and look at the shoe on the ground.
STANLEY: ( TERRIFIED )
JOHNNY: Somebody threw it at my fuckin' Then snaps Matthew's rubber band at them it hits Stanley who Jees, Matthew? Come on
STANLEY: Jees, Matthew? Come on
JOHNNY: Did either of you find that little No. No one knows where he is Suddenly, a car SCREECHES up - it's Storch and it looks as if he is going to drive his cruiser straight through the fence.
ANDY: No. No one knows where he is Suddenly, a car SCREECHES up - it's Storch and it looks as if he is going to drive his cruiser straight through the fence.
STANLEY: Ah shit. This ain't good. Johnny picks the shoe up. Storch blasts out of his car, shotgun in hand. He cocks his shotgun and levels it directly at Stanley as he backs him up, planting the shotgun into his cheek.
SHERIFF STORCH: Then you want to tell me why this was dropped off at my house?! To my WIFE! Storch shoves the TAPE in Stanley's mouth - gagging him. Then turns to Johnny.
JOHNNY: Nah, genius over here reloaded. Tape you smashed had nothing on it. Storch looks to Johnny - then snaps his gun towards him. Lstu4 4noq Maui nox

JOHNNY: Hey, I just found out myself. Storch swings the gun back to Stanley.
SHERIFF STORCH: Eat that tape fatboy. Andy starts to laugh as Starch trains the gun back on them-
STORCH: Shut your pie hole. Think this is funny?! I'll have him shit it down your throat when's he done eating it. Got that boy? .LAM; The Sheriff fires a shot into the air. They all jump, Stanley covers his ears like it hurt.
SHERIFF STORCH: See, there's two kinds of crazy people. One likes to get buck naked and howl at the moon. The other kind does the exact same thing, only in my backyard. The first kind'I don't have to deal with, you know? The Sheriff walks right into Stanley's face as he continues to chew the plastic.
JOHNNY: It's Matthew, Sheriff. Stanley kept the souvenir, but Matthew's the one that took it. The Sheriff backs off a beat, sizes up the situation. Johnny brings forth the shoe. Sheriff's eyes seethe with The crazy bastard left me a Fucking retard is obsessed with her. I think he actually feels ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 6$A. You dipshits bring him to me! I'm gonna cut his little pecker off and use it as a goddamn hood ornament.

SHERIFF STORCH: You dipshits bring him to me! I'm gonna cut his little pecker off and use it as a goddamn hood ornament.

JOHNNY: Much? At all. Kid's fucked three ways to Sunday. We can't find him and trust me, we been looking.
SHERIFF STORCH: You losers couldn't find your own asses with both hands and a map.
MATTHEW: Who's there? Matthew walks cautiously into the cabin.
MATTHEW: ( SCREAMS )
MATTHEW: ( STAMMERS )
JENNIFER: How do you know, Matthew? Matthew props himself up with his hands and manages to get into a sitting position.
MATTHEW: How do you know I'm alive? Are you sure you're'not dreaming again? Matthew shakes his head quickly from side to side. He's not sure of anything any more.
JENNIFER: How do you know I'm alive? Are you sure you're'not dreaming again? Matthew shakes his head quickly from side to side. He's not sure of anything any more.
MATTHEW: I.am I dreaming? Jennifer pats the couch next to her.
JENNIFER: Come here. Come sit down. Matthew staggers to his feet. He's overcome with emotion.
MATTHEW: I. I. need to tell. Jennifer holds a single finger to her lips.
JENNIFER: Shh. it's all okay, Matthew. I know that none of this was your fault. You tried to help me.
MATTHEW: I did. I really did.
JENNIFER: I know that, Matthew. Now come. Matthew sits down next to Jennifer. It's almost as if some force is controlling him. Matthew looks into her eyes. He leans forwards and rests his head in Jennifer's lap. He finally lets himself go, like a child having a meltdown.
MATTHEW: ( SOBBING )
JENNIFER: ( stroking his head ) Shh.I know. I know you are. Matthew's so caught up in the moment, that he fails to notice A ROPE from the tool shed with a good SLIT KNOT being snaked around his neck.
MATTHEW: ( STRUGGLING )
JENNIFER: I'm sorry? That's just not good She pulls the slip knot around his neck again and begins to
CHOKE HIM: JENNIFER ( CONT'D )
JENNIFER: Forgive me father, for I will sin.
STANLEY: You want some? My last bag.
ANDY: No, get that shit out of my face.
STANLEY: What's your problem?
ANDY: I'm tired, I'm hungry
STANLEY: I offered you
ANDY: I don't want that shit. I want real food, I want my bed, I want this bullshit to be over.
STANLEY: Well the sooner we find Matthew.

ANDY: Ain't it obvious? We drag that homo back to the sheriff, he's a dead So what? Better him than me.
STANLEY: So what? Better him than me.
ANDY: ( ANGRILY )
ANDY: Then, Andy notices an uneven ripple in the water. He thinks nothing of it. until it happens again. This catches his eye. Slowly he makes his way over. The water has calmed now, but still, Andy has a sense that something is not right.
STANLEY: Jesus! You bastard! Stanley laughs so hard he starts to cough Just as they're about to continue on - the sound of a harmonica breaks through. The same eerie tune.
ANDY: Jesus! You bastard! Stanley laughs so hard he starts to cough Just as they're about to continue on - the sound of a harmonica breaks through. The same eerie tune.
STANLEY: Prick's playing your song. He looks at Stanley.
ANDY: The hell with the Sheriff, I'm gonna kill him myself. MATTHEW!!
ANDY: You're ass is grass Matthew!! Branches and leaves fly by as Andy barrels through the foliage. Stanley tries to keep up, but it's no use.
STANLEY: Matthew! You're a dead man! They race off after the sound.
ANDY: Don't you pass out on me. I ain't dragging your ass back. Suddenly, the tune stops. Andy stops in his tracks, trying to figure out which way to proceed. Suddenly, Stanley hears another sound. Crying.
STANLEY: Hear that? They're off again. About fifty yards away, hidden behind the trees, is the SHACK. Something slips around the side of the structure. Stanley immediately spots what he thinks is He's in there all right.
ANDY: He's in there all right.
STANLEY: Good, cause he's coming out in pieces. Andy races ahead leaving Stanley trying to catch his breath behind him.
ANDY: Matthew! Where the fuck are you!
STANLEY: Why you little bitch. Stanley races over - Just as Stanley gets close - SNAP!! A hidden BEAR TRAP clamps down on Stanley's leg - the pain is intense as he screams out - He staggers backwards and falls to the ground in agony
ANDY: ( PAINED SCREAMS )
JENNIFER: I know. You like to watch. Don't you. Don't you worry, I'll give you quite a show. She sets the camera on top of a tri-pod right in front of his face, frames up and hits record. She looks up to him. Stanley's arms are tied behind a tree, his head is held in position, duct tapped back against the tree. His legs are anchored to the ground. The bloody mangled one still in the bear trap that bites and gnaws at his leg with every move.
STANLEY: Bbbb. bitch! Let me go! She grabs his nose and pulls open his mouth shoving a MAGGOT INFESTED RODENT into his mouth.
JENNIFER: What's wrong, you don't like it? I prefer the maggots to the meat. Jennifer site down next to Stanley. She glances over to the monitor to see what he is looking at. Then she reaches over and into a burlap sack. Stanley stares straight ahead, at the monitor in front of Jennifer reaches into the burlap bag and takes out a roll of fishing line. Then she takes out a pack of fish hooks. Stanley's eyes go wide. Jennifer removes the hooks from their package. She holds one between her thumb and forefinger and studies the barbed tip. Smiling to herself, she threads the hooks with fishing line.
STANLEY: Wh.what are you doing with that?
JENNIFER: ( LAUGHS )
STANLEY: What are you.. Please don't. Then she pops the hook through the lid and pulls the fishing line back over his head. Stanley screams something fierce as she continues to thread his eyelid open, slowly, methodically, delivering as much pain with every pull of the line, from one eye to the next. His eyeballs bulge unnaturally, twitching wildly All Stanley can do is stare ahead and watch himself on the I'll be back before you have a chance to blink. Jennifer stands up and brushes herself off and walks to WITH ANDY: Jennifer comes over and slaps him in the head.
JENNIFER: I'll be back before you have a chance to blink. Jennifer stands up and brushes herself off and walks to WITH ANDY: Jennifer comes over and slaps him in the head.
ANDY: Please. please. I can't.
JENNIFER: Please? I thought, no, I'm pretty sure you said something like Jennifer grabs a wad of his HAIR and SMASHES his face into
SUCK: She slams his head back down and holds it - then up
IT: She slams his head back down again and holds it then up
STANLEY: Please. Please. My eyes. I can't take it anymore. please.
JENNIFER: Let me help you. Jennifer takes a slender knife from the bag. Working quickly, Jennifer guts a FISH.
STANLEY: 85 TNT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 85 The water has filled up the trough and is overflowing. Andy struggles to lift his head up to draw a few quick breaths. Jennifer climbs onto his back and GRABS his hair pulling his head up.
JENNIFER: Don't drown too soon. Andy tries to buck her off, gasping for breath, buckling under her added weight. Jennifer slams his head back into the water, and then up again. then down as she holds it.
ANDY: ( CHOKING )
JENNIFER: Now is that any way to talk to a And back down with his head - it is exhausting to watch. WITH STANLEY: As a single CROW shows up by his head. He tries to look at the bird to see what it is doing, but he can't move. ON THE MONITOR: The CROW has jumped onto Stanley's head - looking at his eyes It begins to peck at them. Stanley
SCREAMS!: ON ANDY:
ANDY: Wha what is that?
JENNIFER: oh, just some lye I found laying Jesus, please, what the - no! Jennifer pours the lye into the bucket - the fumes make Andy gag. But he holds his neck up as long as he can - he does not want to put his face down. Jennifer come around in front of him.
ANDY: Jesus, please, what the - no! Jennifer pours the lye into the bucket - the fumes make Andy gag. But he holds his neck up as long as he can - he does not want to put his face down. Jennifer come around in front of him.
JENNIFER: Let's see how long you can keep that pretty little face of yours. Andy strains to keep his head faced at her.
ANDY: Fuck you.
JENNIFER: You already did that. I didn't enjoy it much. Now it's my turn to fuck you. Andy's neck is straining to keep his head out.
ANDY: ( STRAINED )
JENNIFER: Fuck you. Andy's neck gives out dunking his head in the lye bath. He writhes with pain as he lifts it back out - BEET RED and
ANDY: Fuck you. Andy's neck gives out dunking his head in the lye bath. He writhes with pain as he lifts it back out - BEET RED and
JENNIFER: Fuck you. Andy's neck gives out dunking his head in the lye bath. He writhes with pain as he lifts it back out - BEET RED and
BURNING: Jennifer laughs and walks out of the shack as Andy gasps, chokes and spits for his life as- STANLEY'S head is covered in crows.
ANDY: Jennifer laughs and walks out of the shack as Andy gasps, chokes and spits for his life as- STANLEY'S head is covered in crows.
JOHNNY: .since when? Since last night. No Sheriff, I ain't heard from 'em. Johnny notices something in his small surveillance TV. ANGLE ON TV: A truck pulls up to the station, a hot woman in a skimpy outfit gets out of the truck. She pops the hood obscuring her once she does. Johnny sits up in his seat.
JOHNNY: Can I fill it up for you, ma'am? The woman wears sunglasses and slowly turns to Johnny. Johnny takes a long look from bottom to top - and when he gets to her face - it registers - but before he can do anything, Jennifer swings a tire iron and catches him right across the jaw. A handful of teeth, ejected by a spurt of fresh blood as Johnny falls face-first into the ground.
JOHNNY: FTHUCKKK YOU
FTHUCKKK YOU: He grunts out a hellacious scream as his body bucks wildly.
JENNIFER: Oooh, you're an ornery stallion, aren't you? Jennifer tilts her head and looks at him, as you would a fascinating piece of art.
JOHNNY: With a bunch of teeth missing, Johnny's lisp is pronounced. Jennifer saunters around him seductively. She removes something from behind her back and brings forth a rusty pair of pliers. Jennifer steps closer.
JENNIFER: Oh, that's the problem. You still have some teeth left. We're gonna have to fix that. Jennifer clamps the.pliers down tightly on Johnny's tooth. He tries to move but between the bridle cutting into his mouth and the pressure on the tooth, it's sheer agony. Jennifer jerks her hand from side to side, squeezing the tooth as hard as she can in the pliers. Finally, the root breaks free of the pulp and Johnny's tooth is extracted. Johnny flails around in severe agony.
PLEATH: As Jennifer begins to extract yet another tooth, Johnny's weary body convulses in so much pain that he actually pisses Pleath.for the loth oth thod,
JOHNNY: Pleath.for the loth oth thod,
JENNIFER: That's disgusting. Even your boys didn't piss themselves. Be a man, will you?! Jennifer takes the bridle and yanks Johnny's around, the pain is so bad he can hardly fight. He grimaces and spits out a mouthful of blood at her.
JOHNNY: Justh kill me. Kill me you bith.
JENNIFER: We'll get to that. Jennifer pulls out a gun.
JOHNNY: ( SPITTING BLOOD ) ( BEAT )
WHORE: I hear sometimes a stallion can get a little headstrong. They don't want to be trained. refuse to be But everyone has their breaking point, don't they?
JENNIFER: I hear sometimes a stallion can get a little headstrong. They don't want to be trained. refuse to be But everyone has their breaking point, don't they?
SHERIFF STORCH: Hi, honey.
MRS. STORCH: What's wrong?
SHERIFF STORCH: Nothing, why?
MRS. STORCH: Why? Because I can hear it in your voice, that's why. Sheriff Storch laughs. She knows him too well.
SHERIFF STORCH: Long day, that's all.
SHERIFF STORCH: Mrs. Novick?
MRS. STORCH: No, for the honors program. Do you remember anything?
SHERIFF STORCH: Oh yeah, okay.

SHERIFF STORCH: Well, I'll be home when I can. Busy today. if I don't make it, send her my regards. Sheriff Storch ends the call. Two seconds later the phone rings again. He looks at it, annoyed, answers.
CHASTITY: Hey daddy! Where are you?
SHERIFF STORCH: ( ANNOYED )
CHASTITY: But I really want you to meet my new teacher. She is way cool. Sheriff Storch rolls his eyes.
JENNIFER: Howdy, Sheriff.
SHERIFF STORCH: Hi. It's truly an honor to speak with you Miss.
JENNIFER: Hills. Jennifer Hills.
SHERIFF STORCH: Excuse me?
JENNIFER: I have to tell you, it's really been a pleasure meeting your family. You have a wonderful daughter with a bright and promising future.
SHERIFF STORCH: What the fuck do you think you're We'll see you soon, Sheriff.
JENNIFER: We'll see you soon, Sheriff.
SHERIFF STORCH: No - wait But the call ends.
MRS. STORCH: What is Sheriff Storch grabs his wife's shoulders.
SHERIFF STORCH: Chastity, where is she?! Mrs. Storch has absolutely no idea what is going on. In her mind, their daughter couldn't be in better hands.
MRS. STORCH: What she. she went to Hansen Park with Miss Hills.
SHERIFF STORCH: MRS. STORCH Who is she? Who is this woman? He turns and runs back to his squad car, gets inside, and pulls away even faster than he came.
MRS. STORCH: ( GROWING CONCERN )
SHERIFF STORCH: Jennifer walks over to the table and rests her elbow on it. Sheriff Storch speaks through gritted teeth.
JENNIFER: Does that hurt? Come on, I thought you were an ass man, Sheriff.
SHERIFF STORCH: Where is she, you bitch? Jennifer slams the gun deeper. The Sheriff's body goes stiff. The Sheriff screams again.
JENNIFER: I'd be careful how you speak to me at the moment, Sheriff. ( BEAT ) By "she," I assume you mean your What'd you do to her?
SHERIFF STORCH: What'd you do to her?
JENNIFER: She really is lovely, Sheriff. So young. So sweet. I mean, can you Imagine what?
SHERIFF STORCH: Imagine what?
JENNIFER: Imagine if someone had done this to Jennifer walks behind the Sheriff. She wraps her fingers around the barrel of the gun and shoves it in, deeper. The Sheriff's expression is one of unbridled agony. Jennifer continues to sodomize him with the shotgun.
SHERIFF STORCH: ( FRANTIC )
JENNIFER: So was I. She gets to the corner of the room where a hulking figure site tied up in a burlap sack. Jennifer removes it revealing a dead MATTHEW. or is he? She ties the line to Matthews wrist. The other end is tied onto the shotgun's trigger.
SHERIFF STORCH: ( DESPERATE )
JENNIFER: Neither are you.
JENNIFER: He'll be waking up soon. If I were you, I'd tell him not to move.
SHERIFF STORCH: ( pained to talk ) I'm begging you. Don't do this. We can figure something out. Matthew stirs again.
JENNIFER: Sorry, Sheriff. She leans in close to his face.
SHERIFF STORCH: Matthew don't! But it's too late - a startled Matthew jumps back
MATTHEW: BANQ/// Matthew is splattered with blood, and body parts.
