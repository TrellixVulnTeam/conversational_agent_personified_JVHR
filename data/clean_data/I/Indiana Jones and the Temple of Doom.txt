WILLIE: Holy cow India? How do you know we're in
WILLIE: ( to Indiana ) What'd he say?
INDIANA: He told me they knew I was coming What do you mean how?
WILLIE: What do you mean how?
INDIANA: The old man saw it in a dream.
WILLIE: Dream nightmare is more like it.
INDIANA: He said that's whey they were at river they were waiting for the plane to fall down.
WILLIE: ( quietly to Indy ) I hope this means we're going to get some dinner.
WILLIE: ( quietly )
INDIANA: That's more food than these people eat in a week. They're starving, too.
WILLIE: I'm sorry, I here, please.
CHIEFTAIN: You will rest here before you go We'd appreciate that. This was an unexpected detour. We'll have to go to Delhi now and find a flight west.
INDIANA: We'd appreciate that. This was an unexpected detour. We'll have to go to Delhi now and find a flight west.
SHORT ROUND: ( smiling )
INDIANA: I'm a professor. I have to re- turn to the university. Can you give us a guide to take us to Delhi?
CHIEFTAIN: Sanju will guide you.
INDIANA: Thank you.
SHAMAN: On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
INDIANA: ( puzzled )
SHAMAN: You will go to palace there.
INDIANA: Hasn't the Pankot palace been de- serted since the Mutiny of 1857?
SHAMAN: ( darkly )
INDIANA: I don't understand. What's hap- pened here?
SHAMAN: The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.
INDIANA: What evil?
SHAMAN: They came from Palace and took sivalinga from out village.
WILLIE: Took what?
INDIANA: It's a sacred stone in a shine that's supposed to protect a It is why Krishna brought you here.
SHAMAN: It is why Krishna brought you here.
INDIANA: ( politely firm ) Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed. We were shot down by
SHAMAN: ( interrupting ) No. We pray to Krishna to help us find the stone. It was Krishna who made you fall from sky so you can got to Pankot Palace. To find siva- linga and bring back to us.
SHORT ROUND: Indy, they make out plane crash? To get you here?
INDIANA: It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story.
CHIEFTAIN: Indiana seems skeptical as he kneels to study the shrine. On top of the pile of rocks, there is a carved niche. The niche is empty but an indentation indicates the conical shape of the stone that was stolen.
INDIANA: Was the stone very smooth? It was probably brought here from a sacred river.
SHAMAN: ( joining Indy and Long ago before my father's And it had three lines painted across it? The lines represent the three levels of the universe. I've seen stones like the one you lost.
INDIANA: And it had three lines painted across it? The lines represent the three levels of the universe. I've seen stones like the one you lost.
WILLIE: I don't understand how losing one rock could destroy this village. Is it really powerful?
INDIANA: But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone?
SHAMAN: They say we must pray to their evil god. We say we will not.
INDIANA: ( translating )
INDIANA: ( translating )
INDIANA: ( translating )
WILLIE: Their children?
INDIANA: ( translating )
SHAMAN: You will find them when you find I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here. The English authorities who con- trol this area are the only ones who can help you.
INDIANA: I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here. The English authorities who con- trol this area are the only ones who can help you.
CHIEFTAIN: They do not listen.
INDIANA: I have friends in Delhi and I will make sure they investigate this.
SHAMAN: No, you will got to Pankot. What'd he say now?
WILLIE: What'd he say now?
INDIANA: It was destined that I came here and the future cannot be changed.
LITTLE BOY: A mother rushes into the hut now and kneels and hugs her little boy. His skinny arms go around her as they are reunited. Indy stands slowly and looks at what the little boy gave him It is a small tattered piece of cloth: an old fragment of a mini- ature painting. Indiana looks at it with an expression of recog- nition and apprehension.
INDIANA: 45. EXT. THE VILLAGE - MORNING 45.
INDIANA: Damn it , Willie, get on we've got to move out!
WILLIE: Whoa! Easy now nice elephant.
SHORT ROUND: I ride with you, Indy?
INDIANA: Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty.
SHORT ROUND: Oh boy!
WILLIE: ( to Short Round ) This is the first time anybody ever cried when I left.
SHORT ROUND: They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
WILLIE: SHORT ROUND
SHORT ROUND: They got no food to feed them. So they taking the elephants away to sell them.
INDIANA: All right, let's go. I want to get to Pankot before tomorrow night.
WILLIE: Pankot?! I thought we were going to Delhi! Hey, wait a minute! Can't somebody take me to Delhi?! I don't want to go to Pankot! Indiana! Damn it! Why'd you change your mind? What did that kid tell you last night?!
WILLIE: ( to her elephant ) I think you need this more than What're you complaining about, this is expensive stuff!
SHORT ROUND: Here you go, lunch time! Indy, look!
WILLIE: Those are very big bird.
INDIANA: Those aren't birds those are giant bats.
WILLIE: They must be pretty dumb to drink that awful-looking water.
INDIANA: I think maybe we'll camp here.
INDIANA: Hey, Willie I think you better get out now.
WILLIE: Stark naked? You wish. If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
INDIANA: Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off. I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water.
WILLIE: Somehow I feel safer in here.
WILLIE: Indy! Help me!
INDIANA: Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
WILLIE: A snake!
INDIANA: A what.?
WILLIE: A SNAKE!! Hurry, help me out of here! What're you waiting for?!
A SNAKE!!: He finally sees the boa constrictor thrashing in the water close to Willie. He leaves his boots on.
INDIANA: Uh, listen Willie I got a better idea.
WILLIE: First of all don't panic! It's got me ! Indy, help me!
INDIANA: First of all don't panic! It's got me ! Indy, help me!
WILLIE: It's got me ! Indy, help me!
INDIANA: Don't let it pull you deeper!
WILLIE: It's pulling me deeper!
INDIANA: Don't let it curl around you!
WILLIE: It's curling around me! Damn it, stop talking and do something! What's wrong?! Indy please help
INDIANA: Listen, Willie. Do exactly what I tell you now.
WILLIE: Can you move your arm?
INDIANA: Can you move your arm?
WILLIE: Just one arm!
INDIANA: Okay, I want you to lift your hand and pet the snake.
WILLIE: PET IT??!! Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal verte- THE WHAT?! Pet it on the head! Go on, pet

INDIANA: Pet it on the head! Go on, pet
WILLIE: Oh my god it's going to crush me!
INDIANA: Keep stroking it! What's happening?
WILLIE: It's starting to let go!
INDIANA: That's good you're doing fine.
WILLIE: It's letting fo. I think it's I think it's going to sleep!
INDIANA: See I got you out.
WILLIE: Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!
INDIANA: ( looking at
SHORT ROUND: You come to America with me, and we can get job in the circus you like that?
WILLIE: Where'd you find your little body- I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket. Shorty's family was killed when they bombed Shanghai. He was living on the streets.
INDIANA: I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket. Shorty's family was killed when they bombed Shanghai. He was living on the streets.
WILLIE: ( smiling )
INDIANA: By the way, how'd you end up in Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that "a girl could go places in the Orient." So, look where I got.
WILLIE: Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that "a girl could go places in the Orient." So, look where I got.
INDIANA: What about the future?
WILLIE: Oh, that's easy I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, in- credibly rich prince.
INDIANA: I'd like to find one of those Oh really?
WILLIE: ( raising an eyebrow ) Oh really?
INDIANA: Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years. Fortune and glory.
WILLIE: Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?
INDIANA: Indy reaches into his pocket and removes the old piece of cloth.
WILLIE: What's that?
INDIANA: Something that kid gave me last night. It's a piece of an old The drawing shows a priest named Sankara who lived centuries ago.
WILLIE: What does the writing say?
INDIANA: It's Sanskrit. It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva.
WILLIE: ( examining it ) That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?
INDIANA: Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
WILLIE: ( looking at Indy ) You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village?
INDIANA: It could be.
WILLIE: ( quietly )
INDIANA: I think you should sleep closer. I meant for safety.
WILLIE: ( smiling )
WILLIE: Did you see it?! It was one of those bats! God, what else is out there.?! Couldn't keep away, huh?
INDIANA: Couldn't keep away, huh?
WILLIE: Just try and control yourself.
INDIANA: ( without looking ) Still scared? Okay, Willie, you can get closer if you want.
INDIANA: Honey, I knew you'd be the first one to give in. You're going to start something I'm going to have to finish. Okay, doll, you asked for it.
SHORT ROUND: Indy, look!
INDIANA: That's it. Pankot Palace.
SHORT ROUND: What you look at, Indy?
INDIANA: Just a statue.
WILLIE: What's the guide talking about? He hasn't said a word the whole
WILLIE: He's afraid of something.
INDIANA: He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the You mean we have to walk the rest of the way?
WILLIE: You mean we have to walk the rest of the way?
WILLIE: shot at, fallen out of a plane, nearly drowned, squashed by a snake, attacked by a bat I smell like an elephant! I tell you I'm not going to make it!
INDIANA: Any more complaints?
WILLIE: ( smiling faintly ) Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this
INDIANA: It doesn't feel like there's been any permanent damage.
INDIANA: Hello?.( hello? ).( hello? )
WILLIE: ( frightened ) Hi.( hi ).( hi ). I would say you look rather lost. But then I cannot imagine where in the world the three of you would look at home.
CHATTAR LAL: I would say you look rather lost. But then I cannot imagine where in the world the three of you would look at home.
INDIANA: ( smiling evenly ) Lost? No, we're not lost. We're on our way to Delhi. This is Miss Scott and Mr. Round. My name's Indiana Jones.
CHATTAR LAL: ( surprised )
WILLIE: Hard to believe, isn't it.?
CHATTAR LAL: I remember first hearing your name when I was studying at Oxford. I Am Chattar Lal, Prime Minister for His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot. Welcome to Pankot Palace.
WILLIE: ( to Short Round ) How'd you like to run into him in a dark alley.that one's kind of cute.I could see myself married to a prince like that. The plane crash and your journey here sound most incredible.
CHATTAR LAL: The plane crash and your journey here sound most incredible.
WILLIE: You should have been there.
INDIANA: We'd appreciate it if the Mahara- jah would let us stay tonight. We'll be on out way in the morn- I am only his humble servant, but the Maharajah usually listens to my advice.
CHATTAR LAL: I am only his humble servant, but the Maharajah usually listens to my advice.
WILLIE: Is that him? He's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken".
CHATTAR LAL: No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
WILLIE: Oh good. And maybe the pres- ent Marahajah is a little younger? And thinner?
CHATTAR LAL: They will escort you to your rooms now. You will be provided with fresh clothes. Tonight you will be dining with His Highness.
WILLIE: Dinner? And with a prince?! My luck is changing. But look at me my god, I've to to get
CHATTAR LAL: Eight o'clock in the Pleasure
INDIANA: You look like a princess.
WILLIE: It's sort of like being in heaven.
INDIANA: ( smiling )
WILLIE: ( snidely )
CHATTAR LAL: We are fortunate tonight to have some many unexpected guests. his is Captain Phillip Blumburtt. Captain Blumburtt and his troops are here to check up on the Just a routine inspection tour.
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: ( politely )
CHATTAR LAL: The British worry so about their Emprie it makes us feel like well-cared-for children.
WILLIE: Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?
CHATTAR LAL: His Highness has not yet taken a No? Well, I guess he just hasn't met the right woman.
WILLIE: ( happily )
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: ( joining Indy )
INDIANA: No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a krtya.
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: ( grimacing )
INDIANA: It's like the voodoo dolls of West Africa. The kryta represents your enemy and gives you complete power over him.
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: That God all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing.
INDIANA: You think so?
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: Of course. Admittedly, it's taken time. Britian's controlled India for almost two hundred eyars now.
INDIANA: You're hanging on better here than you did in America.
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: ( smiling sourly )
INDIANA: The Prime Minister doesn't seem that naive.
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: No, he's a very shrewd old boy. Power behind the throne and all that. He actually runs this whole
WILLIE: I think this Maharajah is swim- ming in money. Maybe coming here wasn't such a bad idea.
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: I believe we're being called to
WILLIE: As the drum beats the assembled guests move toward a long, low table surrounded by colorful pillows. Short Round follows with a little monkey he's found perched on his arm. As everyone stands around the table, Chattar Lal makes an an- nouncement in Hindi and then in English
CHATTAR LAL: His Supremem Highness, guardian of Rajput tradition the Maharajah of Pankot Zalim Singh.
WILLIE: That's the Maharajah that kid?!
INDIANA: Maybe he likes older women.
INDIANA: Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way.
WILLIE: I've never been so hungry in my
WILLIE: ( grimacing )
CHATTAR LAL: His Highness wants me to welcome his visitors. Especially the renowned Dr. Jones from America.
INDIANA: We are honored to be here.
WILLIE: Suddenly I'm not so hungry.
INDIANA: I had a question, Mr. Prime Mini- ster. I was examining some of the Maharajah's artifacts.
CHATTAR LAL: A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?
INDIANA: Yes, very fine. But not all of the pieces look old. Some were carved recently and look like images used by the Thuggees to worship the god- des Kali.
CHATTAR LAL: Dr. Jones, you know very well that the Thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century.
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: Of course. The Thuggees were an obscenity that worshipped Kali with human sacrifices. The Brit- ish Army wiped them out about the time of the Mutiny of 1857. But you're not eating!
MERCHANT: ( looking at Willie ) But you're not eating!
WILLIE: ( weakly )
INDIANA: I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard.
CHATTAR LAL: There are no stories anymore.
INDIANA: Well, I don't know. we came here from a small village and the peas- ants there told us that the Pankot Palace was growing powerful again becuase of some ancient evil.
CHATTAR LAL: ( sneeringly )
INDIANA: ( cooly )
CHATTAR LAL: The local peasants are just as superstitious. You're very ob- servant, Dr. Jones. But you're beginning to worry Capt. Blum-
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: I'm not worried, Prime Minister, just interested.
WILLIE: ( to Short Round ) Give me your hat.
SHORT ROUND: What for?
WILLIE: I'm going to puke in it.
INDIANA: You know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them.
CHATTAR LAL: Dr. Jones, it our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
INDIANA: Sorry, I thought we were just talking about folklore.
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: ( trying to make peace ) I'm sure it's nothing. Just ru- What was it they claimed was Something magical. A sacred rock.
INDIANA: Something magical. A sacred rock.
CHATTAR LAL: ( condescendingly )
INDIANA: When they lost this rock their fields and animals dies. They also said their children were taken from them.
CHATTAR LAL: I think that's enough of this nonsense, Dr. Jones.
WILLIE: So you have something, you know, simple like soup or something?
MERCHANT: Looks delicious!
WILLIE: I wanna go home.
INDIANA: ( to Chattar Lal ) I was dubious muself at first. Then something connected the village's rock and the old legend of the Sankara Stones.
CHATTAR LAL: ( controlling himself ) Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. I seem to re- member that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.
INDIANA: ( shrugging )
CHATTAR LAL: And didn't the Sultan of Madagas- car threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his coun- That was a misunderstanding.
INDIANA: That was a misunderstanding.
CHATTAR LAL: ( smiling ) MAHARAJAH ( Cont'd ) MAHARAJAH ( Cont'd ) ( after a moment )
MAHARAJAH: I have heard the terrible stories of the evil Thuggee cult. I thought the stories were told to frighten children. Later, I learned that the Thuggee cult was once real and did unspeakable I am ashamed of what happened here so many years ago. We keep these objects to remind us that this will never again happen in my I'm sorry if I've offended you.
INDIANA: ( after a moment ) I'm sorry if I've offended you.
MERCHANT: Ah, dessert! Chilled monkey brains!
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: Rather bizarre menu, woundn't you Even if they were trying to scare us away, a devout Hindu would never touch meat. Makes you wonder what these people
INDIANA: Even if they were trying to scare us away, a devout Hindu would never touch meat. Makes you wonder what these people
MAHARAJAH: I have seen this thing. What is it, Dr. Jones?
SHORT ROUND: Hey, nobody touches Indy's whip!
INDIANA: We're guests here, Shorty.
MAHARAJAH: You will show me how it works
INDIANA: You wish is my command, your
MAHARAJAH: That is wonderful! Please teach me how!
INDIANA: Okay, Short Round, let go of it. The Turks say that a whip can be an enemy even to its owner. If you get some rope, it'll be easier to learn with, your Highness. Now, I think we'll say goodnight.
SHORT ROUND: That little Maharajah think he big stuff.
INDIANA: You don't like him do you?
SHORT ROUND: Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes?
INDIANA: SHORT ROUND
SHORT ROUND: Indy, they glow like fire and get real crazy! Then he talk in this real scary voice!
INDIANA: He was afraid of you. He knows a tough guy when he sees one.
SHORT ROUND: ( not so shure )
INDIANA: I better see how Willie is.
INDIANA: I brought you something.
WILLIE: ( disgusted ) Not leftovers?
INDIANA: No real food.
WILLIE: Oh, it is real food.it's You're nice. Listen, I'm taking applications how'd you like to be my palace slave?
INDIANA: ( smiling )
WILLIE: Yeah and nothing else. That shock you?
INDIANA: ( shaking his head ) I'm a scientist. I like doing research on certain "nocturnal
WILLIE: You mean like love rituals.
INDIANA: And mating customs.
WILLIE: Primitive sexual practices?
INDIANA: You're taling to an authority in that area.
WILLIE: You're dying to come into my room, aren't you?
INDIANA: You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
WILLIE: Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
INDIANA: I think you're too used to get- ting you own way, Willie.
WILLIE: ( watching him ) We'll see who gives in first I'll leave my door open.
INDIANA: Don't catch cold.
WILLIE: Dr. Jones ? Five minutes. you'll be back over here in five minutes.
INDIANA: You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my

WILLIE: ( confidently ) Five minutes, Dr. Jones.
INDIANA: ( muttering )
SHORT ROUND: ( half asleep )
INDIANA: Okay, Shorty . see you in the morning.I'm going to have a little word with Willie.

INDIANA: This a cheap trick to get me over
WILLIE: No don't you see crawling
INDIANA: What the bug?
WILLIE: Get the bug off!
INDIANA: Gee, I wouldn't want to touch an ugly critter like that!
SHORT ROUND: ( grinning )
WILLIE: Oh no oh no!!
INDIANA: ( studying the bug ) You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner.
WILLIE: Please oh please, I'm going to die! Get it off!
WILLIE: What did I do to deserve this
SHORT ROUND: It went under. Hey, I feel wind, Indy. I'm packing! I'm getting out of here right now tonight!
WILLIE: I'm packing! I'm getting out of here right now tonight!
INDIANA: ( He reads aloud an inscription in Sanskrit ).
SHORT ROUND: What does it mean, Indy?
INDIANA: ( translating )
INDIANA: ( He repeats aloud the inscrip- tion also written on the cloth )
WILLIE: I don't care if I have to walk to Delhi, I'm hey! Wait a minute! What're you where're you going?!
INDIANA: Lock your door and don't leave until we get back.
SHORT ROUND: I don't think we suppose to be in here, Indy. I step on something.
INDIANA: You're right, there's something all over the floor. We'll have to crawl.
SHORT ROUND: Indy, the floor there is some- thing alive! Holy smoke I'm scared, Indy!
SHORT ROUND: Holy smoke I'm scared, Indy!
INDIANA: There's a chamber here. Come on
INDIANA: Then they hear Willie's voice echoing down the short tunnel.
INDIANA: Yes, we're in here.

MOLA RAM: You were caught trying to steal the Sankara Stones.
INDIANA: ( shrugging )
MOLA RAM: There were five stones in the beginning. Over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you.
INDIANA: Two are still missing.
MOLA RAM: No. They are here somewhere. A century ago when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest his the last two stones down here in the That's what you've got these chil- dren these slaves digging for?
INDIANA: That's what you've got these chil- dren these slaves digging for?

MOLA RAM: The British in India will be slaughtered. Then we will over- run the Moslems and force their "Allah" to bow to Kali. And then the Hebrew God will fall and finally the Christian God will be cast down and forgotten. Soon Kali Ma will rule the world!
