SEAMEN: It's a little rough out there. Could be they can't get through to you in this weather. Maybe they'll come over land.
SEAMEN: Have you things for shelter?
SEAMEN: What things have you?
FLORA: She says, "thank you".

FLORA: ( hand signaling ) Mother. I'm ( speaking ) I'm not going to call him Papa. I'm not going to call HIM anything. I'm not even going to look at HIM.
BAINES: Are we stopping?. Do you want to stop?
BAINES: Shall we stop?
BAINES: Tai hoa! Me tatari tatou .., me tutatou I konei. ( Wait! We are stopping.. we're stopping. )
SUBTITLED: STEWART takes out a comb and drags it dazed and zombie like through his wet hair. Inside the darkness of his pocket, he turns over and over a small, worn edged photograph, a smudge of green light allows us to see ADA's tumbling face. Taking it in the heel of his hand he secretly looks at it. Just as the party return and settle he stares on ahead possessed and determined.
STEWART: We must get on.
TAME: Aue tepatupsiarehe! ( The fairy people, what can you expect? )
SUBTITLED: Sc 16 EXT BEACH MORNINGSc 16 It is early morning. The sea is calmer and the tide is again low. The party or two EUROPEANS and fourteen MAORI MEN and WOMEN come out on to the beach. About half the MAORI party head straight for the shoreline where an older woman loudly organises a pipi collection. All sorts of containers are used from flax baskets to shirts with knots in their arms. The rest follow STEWART and BAINES over to the boxes. STEWART automatically re-combs his hair, patting it against his forehead, where it sticks in a raked pattern. On his head he carefully places a formal top hat, oddly dean compared to his mud splattered suit. The party stops short of the petticoats where a tell-tale foot reveals its ADA and FLORA struggle up to find themselves confronted by a group of men and women. The MAORIS stare curiously and comment on the women.
STEWART: Miss McGrath, Alisdair Stewart. You'll have to wake yourself. I've got men here to carry your Aut he anahera enci? ( Are they angels, they look like angels. )
SUBTITLED: A man points at FLORA's feet and gestures as if holding one of the little shoes in his hand.
SUBTITLED: FLORA is struck by shyness and hides under her mother's skirt. ADA cannot look straight at STEWART and STEWART also cannot look at her.
STEWART: I see you have a good many boxes, I'd like to know what is in each.
STEWART: CAN - YOU - HEAR - ME?
STEWART: Well that is good, yes that is good, good.
STEWART: What's in here? Ohh, yes so it is, written there, crockery.
STEWART: Ohh, yes so it is, written there, crockery.
STEWART: And this one?
STEWART: You're small. I never thought you'd be small.
STEWART: What's here?
STEWART: What's in here then, lead?
FLORA: ( gravely ) It's my mother's A piano?
STEWART: A piano?
STEWART: Tell them to carry in pairs. Those three and those two the black and the red, then the
STEWART: What do you think?
BAINES: She looks tired.
STEWART: She's stunted, that's one
BAINES: Anei nga pouaka - ko era e Me era e raa. ( Here are the boxes, those three and those two. )
UNSUBTITLED: E Hoal
HONE: E Hoal
STEWART: Oh no, it can't come now.
FLORA: It must come.
FLORA: She wants it to come.
STEWART: Yes and so do I, but there are too few of us here to carry it.
STEWART: Do you mean you don't want your kitchenware or your clothes? Is that what you mean?
FLORA: We can't leave the piano
STEWART: Let us not discuss this further. I am very pleased..
FLORA: Mother wants to know if they could come back directly for
FLORA: After they have taken the other
PITO: Kei Riri a te raho Maroke. ( shouted loudly at TAHU ) ( Watch it dry balls is getting touchy. )
SUBTITLED: STEWART nods suspiciously towards the MAORI speaker not understanding him, the speaker smiles and nods back.
STEWART: I suggest you prepare for a difficult journey. The bush will tear clothes and the mud is deep in places.
STEWART: ( to BAINES about the MAORIS ) What are they doing? We don't have time for that.
BAINES: Mr. Stewart asked if I might show you to the path. ( ADA does not move ) . May I carry
BAINES: aha tenei? ( What is it? )
SUBTITLED: E hinga te Koroua ra B Pitama i konci. Kare noa Kia hikina te ( Old man Pitama died here. ( points to the spot ) The Tapu hasn't been lifted )
HONE: E hinga te Koroua ra B Pitama i konci. Kare noa Kia hikina te ( Old man Pitama died here. ( points to the spot ) The Tapu hasn't been lifted )
UNSUBTITLED: STEWART struggles up to the front to join BAINES, he speaks over the top of HONE.
STEWART: What's he say?
BAINES: Someone died here. It's tapu.
STEWART: But we came down this way didn't we? I'm sure we did. 0h Pitama eh.
HONE: E Tarna heke atu ki ram - tiro his atu. Rapuhia mai he huarahi re! ( Go and look, find another track eh! )
UNSUBTITLED: 'cia tupato he ana taniwba ke raro na. ( Go easy there's a ghost down there. )
TIPI: 'cia tupato he ana taniwba ke raro na. ( Go easy there's a ghost down there. )
SUBTITLED: 'Ca, rongo koe i te haunga a tans tutae i te tuatahi. ( You smell his shit first. )
HOTU: 'Ca, rongo koe i te haunga a tans tutae i te tuatahi. ( You smell his shit first. )
UNSUBTITLED: STEWART continues over the top of the MAORI discussion.
STEWART: They want more money. They are trying to make two days out of No, no they know another track - to the side of this.
BAINES: No, no they know another track - to the side of this.
AUNT MORAG: Watch your feet!
NESSIE: Watch your feet!
AUNT MORAG: Careful! Watch his hand.
NESSIE: Watch his hand
AUNT MORAG: Stop it!
AUNT MORAG: ( shooing the Reverend out ) We'll bring out the bride.
AUNT MORAG: LIFT - YOUR - ARM - UP - DEAR.
FLORA: My REAL father was a famous German composer
AUNT MORAG: Ohh the tag is broken.
FLORA: ( continues ) .. They met when my mother was an opera singer. in Luxemburg.

FLORA: ADA looks away, the two women finish primping the dress. FLORA crosses her arms.
FLORA: I want to be in the photograph.
STEWART: The umbrellas are held away, the rain pours down. Sc 23 INT/EXT STEWARTS HUT BEDROOM DAY Sc 23 AUNT MORAG has brought a chair into the bedroom and sits knee to knee with FLORA.
AUNT MORAG: I thought she met your father in Luxemburg.
FLORA: Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.
AUNT MORAG: ( frowning ) And where did they get married?
FLORA: ( her Scottish accent becomes thick and expressive ) In an enormous forest, with real fairies as bridesmaids each holding a little elf's hand.
FLORA: No, I tell a lie, it was in a small country church, near the
AUNT MORAG: Which mountains are those dear?
FLORA: The Alps.
AUNT MORAG: Ohhh I've never been there. ( she leans forward )
FLORA: Mother used to sing the songs in German and her voice would echo across the valleys That was before the Oh what happened?
AUNT MORAG: Oh what happened?
FLORA: One day when my mother and father were singing together in the forest, a great storm blew up out of nowhere. But so passionate was their singing that they did not notice, nor did they stop as the rain began to fall and when their voices rose for the final bars of the duet a great bolt of lightening came out of the sky and struck my father so that he lit up like a torch. And at the same moment my father was struck dead my mother was struck dumb! She- never-spoke-another-word.
AUNT MORAG: Ohhh . dear. Not another word From the shock, yes it would
AUNT MORAG: Terrible. Terrible
STEWART: I shall be gone for some days. There is some Maori land I want and may buy very reasonably. ( STEWART shuffles ) I am hoping you will use the time to settle in, and, in some ways we may start again
STEWART: All right? I'm not able to read.
BAINES: I'm not able to read.
FLORA: Please take us to the beach where we landed.
BAINES: I'm sorry, I can't do that. ( FLORA and ADA stare evenly at him ) I don't have the time. ( They continue to stare. )
BAINES: I - can't - take - you there. I can't do it.
STEWART: Hello, then.
FLORA: ADA nods. STEWART'S hand explores the markings on the table. ADA watches his hand moving under the checked cloth. Sc 34 INT MISSION HOUSE DAY Sc 34 AUNT MORAG, NESSIE and TWO MAORI GIRLS dressed in proper Victorian costume are kneeling around a huge double white sheet, sewing and cutting it. The MAORI girls are part of the mission's good works. They are dressed in European style and while their training is in polite proper domestic behaviour they constantly corrupt it with their demonstrative displays of affection, and their clay tobacco pipes to which they are addicted. STEWART is standing, looking on. BAINES is behind him in the kitchen removing his boots.
AUNT MORAG: ( looking carefully at STEWART ) Well you stopped combing your hair, which is a good thing, it was looking over done. ( without pause but referring to the sheet ) You see these are the slits that the heads will go through, show him Nessie . they'll be dead, the Reverend is going to use animal blood, no doubt it will be very dramatic. Tea! ( for NESSIE rather than to her )
NESSIE: It will be very dramatic. ( sitting down ) What would you think if someone played a kitchen table like it were a piano?
STEWART: ( sitting down ) What would you think if someone played a kitchen table like it were a piano?
AUNT MORAG: Like it were a piano?
STEWART: It's strange isn't it? I mean it's not a piano, it doesn't make any sound.
AUNT MORAG: ( hissing to NESSIE ) Biscuits.' No, no sound.
STEWART: I knew she was mute, but now I'm thinking it's more than that. I'm wondering if she's not brain affected.
AUNT MORAG: No sound at all?
STEWART: No, it was a table.
AUNT MORAG: ( musing ) Well, she was very violent with the gown. She tore off a chunk of lace. if hadn't been there I'd have sworn she'd used her teeth
NESSIE: and wiped her feet an it.
STEWART: Well it has not yet come to anything. Just a concern.
AUNT MORAG: Oh, yes, yes of course, a There is something to be said for silence
STEWART: There is something to be said for silence
AUNT MORAG: Oh indeed. Cotton'.
STEWART: ( warming ) And with time she will, I'm sure, become Certainly, there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent.
AUNT MORAG: Certainly, there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent.
BAINES: Those 80 acres, that cross the stream, what do you think of On your property?
STEWART: On your property?
BAINES: BAINES carries a log across for STEWART who talks without pausing in his work,
STEWART: Good, flatish land with reliable water, why? I don't have money. What are you about?
BAINES: I'd like to make a swap.
STEWART: What for?
BAINES: The piano.
STEWART: The piano on the beach? Ada's
STEWART: It's not marshy is it?
BAINES: You'd have to organise it up Yes, I thought that.
STEWART: You'd have to organise it up Yes, I thought that.
BAINES: Yes, I thought that.
STEWART: Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
BAINES: I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without Yes, I suppose you would.
STEWART: Yes, I suppose you would.
STEWART: Well Ada can play.
STEWART: I have it in a letter she plays well. She's been playing since she was 5 or6.
STEWART: I have got us some excellent land. Baines has taken some queer idea to have a piano, and you are to give him lessons. Have you taught before?
FLORA: What on?
STEWART: On your piano, that is the
STEWART: What does she say?
FLORA: She says it's her piano, and she won't have him touch it. He's an oaf, he can't read, he's ignorant.
STEWART: He wants to improve himself. and you will be able to play on it . ( ADA is not responding well ) Teach him to look after NO! NO! THE PIANO IS MINE! IT'S
MINE!: STEWART regards her note and her passion with suspicion and disdain
STEWART: ( getting up ) You can't go on like this, we are a family now, all of us make sacrifices and so will you. You will teach him. I shall see to that! HiM na ake 'nun na'. ( Lift up the back )
UNSUBTITLED: Tern - tern! ( Ass hole! ) Hei niti niti maan! ( turning around ) You lick it. ) I'd try children's tunes, nothing more complicated
STEWART: I'd try children's tunes, nothing more complicated
STEWART: Just be encouraging no one expects him to be good.
STEWART: ( lifting the lid ) It looks good, very nice looking thing. Well . I wish you luck. The girls are very excited about the
STEWART: Flora will explain anything Ada says. They talk through their fingers, you can't believe what they say with just their hands.
FLORA: My mother wants to see your hands. Hold them out. No, no, like this
FLORA: You have to wash them.
BAINES: They are washed.
FLORA: Wash them again.
BAINES: The marks do not come out. They are scars and hardened
FLORA: There's no tune left in the piano so she can't teach you.
BLIND MAN: Ah, a Broadbent. A fine instrument. I've not come across one here, or in the Islands where I have tuned some 200. Yes, they like their pianos there. Scent? And salt of course. What will you play when it's tuned? What music do you play?
BAINES: I can't play.
BLIND MAN: You don't play?
BAINES: No, I can't. I'm going to learn. Well my dear Miss Broadbent, tuned, but silent.
BLIND MAN: Well my dear Miss Broadbent, tuned, but silent.
FLORA: Mother says she can't stand to teach piano with it all out or tune. So I'm to do scales. I hope you've scrubbed your Oh, it's in tune.
FLORA: I hope you've scrubbed your Oh, it's in tune.
FLORA: What's out there?
FLORA: You have to watch me where I put my fingers.
FLORA: It's in tune.
FLORA: ( Hissing ) I was teaching.
FLORA: She wants to see what you can I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
BAINES: I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
FLORA: Everyone has to practice.
BAINES: I just want to listen.
FLORA: What do you want to hear?
BAINES: ADA is slow to start. Unobliging as ever she plays scales. But once begun her belligerence fades as her absorption in the music Sc 49 INT STEWART'S HUT/ADA'S BEDROOM NIGHT Sc 49 Back at STEWART'S hut, ADA lies dispirited on the bed. FLORA lies beside her holding ADA's hand.
FLORA: Tell me about my real father. How did you speak to him? I didn't need to speak, I could lay thoughts out in his mind like they were a sheet
FLORA: What happened? Why didn't you get married? After a while he became frightened and he stopped
STEWART: Shall I kiss you goodnight?
BAINES: Do you know how to bargain, nod if you do. There's a way you can have your piano back. Do you want it back? You want it back?
BAINES: You see I'd like us to make a deal. There's things I want to do while you stay. If you let me you can earn it back. What do you think, one visit for every key.
BAINES: Your dress? Skirt .? For every black one? That's a lot less, half. All right, all right then, the black keys. It's better that you play.
BAINES: Play. Keep playing.
HIRA: I got the good wife for you Peini. She pray good. Clean. Read Bible. You sleep her Peini. She chief daughter.
BAINES: No, no bible readers.
HIRA: Why? We need you pakeha clever. You sleep her.
TAHU: ( A big man dressed as a woman ) ( Background ) I give her plenty clever. ( Gestures sexually )
BAINES: I have a wife.
TAHU: ( camping it up ) I give her clever eb Peini. Hallelujah!
HIRA: Don't answer, he low born. Jun look at him, mongrel. Your wife where she?
BAINES: She lives her own life in New Jersey, America.
HIRA: You have spare wife here Peini. You get rnana for that. Our chief four wives. I marry white man Peini, he a whaler like you. He very good to me. Love me, nurse me.
HIRA: Who do that? It not finish, that no good Peini. You finish!
FLORA: ( small voice ) I want to speak to my mother I don't want to be outside, I want to watch. I'll be very quiet. I won't look at him! "I shall listen hard to rehearsal, because I live too far away to go often."
AUNT MORAG: ( suspiciously ) Which sign is the word rehearsal?
AUNT MORAG: I can't imagine a fate worse than being dumb. Turn around.
NESSIE: To be deaf?
AUNT MORAG: Oh yes, dear too - TERRIBLE!
AWFUL!"': Actually, to tell you the whole truth, Mama says most people speak rubbish and it's not worth the listen.
FLORA: Actually, to tell you the whole truth, Mama says most people speak rubbish and it's not worth the listen.
AUNT MORAG: ( stiffly ) Well, that is a strong opinion.
FLORA: Yes, it's unholy.
BAINES: Lift your skirt, Lift it higher. Lift it higher.
BAINES: ADA doesn't hear. She stops and lifts her skirt to her knees. She looks at BAINES with ill-disguised contempt. BAINES is enthralled with her legs, or what he can now see of them. He moves back to watch them from behind. He's lying on the ground, head propped on his arm. ADA's slim stockinged calves work the pedals, one of the stockings has a small hole through which her white skins shows Sc 58 EXT MISSION HOUSE GROUNDS DUSK Sc 58 HENI holds STEWART'S horse near a wooden gate. Its wet coat steams in he night air, making the whole horse glow. HENI talks softly to it in Sc 59 INT MISSION HOUSE NIGHT Sc 59 Inside the REVEREND is closely watched by STEWART, AUNT MORAG and NESSIE as he cuts out the shape of an axe from a piece of marbled cardboard. A lamplight flickers warm tones across their faces while the rest of the room is dark giving it a conspiratorial air.
REVEREND: Nessie, your hand out . out here, please.
NESSIE: Oh, no use Mr Stewart, I can't Nessie, please.
REVEREND: Nessie, please.
REVEREND: Look you are being attacked!
REVEREND: And with the blood . it will be a good effect:
BAINES: Undo your dress. This part, ( he indicates the top ) I want to see your arms. Two keys.
BAINES: BAINES draws his chair close. Gently he places his hand on the soft underpart of her forearm. ADA stiffens and pulls away. He grips the ADA continues to play. Slowly he moves his hand higher towards her shoulder. Clearly unnerved she changes the music to something brisk, almost comical. BAINES feels suddenly ridiculous, his mood broken. He takes his hand away and moves back to the window injured. ADA is victorious, she is pleased to have won herself a respite. Sc 61 EXT STEWART'S WOODCHOP DAY Sc 61 STEWART is at the woodchop talking to AUNT MORAG and NESSIE. MARY and HENI, AUNT MORAG'S Maori girls lie sprawled out under a tree.
AUNT MORAG: I hardly need to give one to you, but there you are anyway. Don't be late. You will see there are two times and since you are accompanying a performer, you will need to make the earlier time
STEWART: The two women stop. There is a Japanese sense of deferment to STEWART
STEWART: How are the lessons going? ADA nods enthusiastically. He's getting on all right? ADA nods again That is good, yes. She seems quieted down. Is she more affectionate?
AUNT MORAG: That is good, yes. She seems quieted down. Is she more affectionate?
AUNT MORAG: Ah well, slowly, slowly
BAINES: Ada, four keys. I just want to lie. All right, all right five.
FLORA: The Holly and the Ivy.
WOMAN: They're bringing in extra
ANOTHER WOMAN: Oh God, don't pin my hair too high Alfred!
STILL ANOTHER: Yes, me too, do it about here . ( she shows Alfred )
MAN ONE: Look who's here, the musical MR BAINES What will we have tonight George, "Twinkle, twinkle?"
ANOTHER MAN: 'Mary had a little lamb' or a polka, come on George what's it to be?
AUNT MORAG: Mr. Baines, do come and turn
BAINES: I can't read music, I have just
STEWART: ( turning ) Lot of fools. Come on, move up. -sing up Billy! -Come on sing out!
REVEREND: And so the young maid came upon each and all of Bluebeard's missing wives, their severed heads still bleeding, their eyes still crying.
REVEREND: But who it this?
BLUEBEARD: I am home early my sweet wife . where art thou?
YOUNG WIFE: Hello husband, what a surprise!
BLUEBEARD: Yes wife, a surprise indeed! So now you know my secret you, the sweetest and youngest or all my wives must be prepared to die. Auc! Ha aba ra tenei? ( Hey! What's this )
SUBTITLED: E Nilie, E Nihe he Kohuru, he ( Nihe, Nihe is this murder? )
SUBTITLED: NIHE waves them down, but they are shaken up and only crouch above their seats. The others stare anxiously between NIHE and the stage.
NIHE: ( Amused by them ) E te whsnau keite pai-he takaro ( Everything is fine this is just a game )
SUBTITLED: BLUEBEARD moves closer, the young wife drops to her knees her hands held up in prayer.
YOUNG WIFE: No, no wait!
BLUEBEARD: I shall not wait. Bare your Kia hiwara! Kin hiwara! ( Be on the alert! Brace yourself ) Pokokohun - whakaputa mai ja ( Coward! Show yourself, come out! )
SUBTITLED: Only NIHE and his top-hatted daughter remain calmly in their seats. The warriors have BLUEBEARD cornered and whimpering an umbrella held spear-like above him. NIHE stomps his stick, his great voice booming
NIHE: Hoki rnai! Hoki rnai! ( Come back here! Come back here! )
SUBTITLED: Sc 70 INT SCHOOL HALL BACK STAGE NIGHT Sc 70 Backstage the CHIEF and his party are shown the theatrical devices; the blood-bucket, the paper axe, the splits in the sheets. Sc 71 INT BAINES' HUT DAY Sc 71 ADA goes to the piano, she is upset that BAINES has again left a plate on top of it. BAINES intercepts her, stepping several times between her and the piano. She sees the game and stands still. He steps aside. She removes the plate, gently, lovingly wiping the surface underneath. There is a sulky irritation in the ways BAINES watches her.
BAINES: I have been waiting. You are very late.
BAINES: I don't want you to play. I just want you to sit.
BAINES: ( angry ) No, not two keys.
BAINES: ( shouts ) Two keys then!
MAORI NEGOTIATOR: ( pointing to the places ) Nga awa kau kau, nga ana koiwi 0 matoti mattia tunpuna; kei runga katoa i te whenua nei korerongia atu ki to tangata na e Peini. ( The bathing waters, the caves, that house, the remains of our ancestors are all part of this land. Explain it to the man Baines. )
SUBTITLED: ( muttering to BAINES across the previous speech ) What do they say? Are they selling? Offer the blankets for half the land.
STEWART: ( muttering to BAINES across the previous speech ) What do they say? Are they selling? Offer the blankets for half the land.
STEWART: Te, kawnarna paraikete mo te tahi hawlie 0 te whenna uci. ( he'll give you twelve blankets for half the land. )
BAINES: Te, kawnarna paraikete mo te tahi hawlie 0 te whenna uci. ( he'll give you twelve blankets for half the land. )
UNSUBTITLED: The MAORIS look carefully at the quality of the blankets, noting the depth of the weave and the strength of the Wool. They shake their heads as they discuss them.
STEWART: ( Quietly to BAINES ) Offer the guns.
MAORI NEGOTIATOR: Kahore atu he kororo. Kahore niaton Kote hake whentia. Engad mate peaks ne. ( No more talk, we won't sell the land. I will trade you pigs, that is all. )
SUBTITLED: He messes up the pattern of twigs as he speaks.
ANGRY MAORI: He aha te pononga 0 te whenus pena kahore he Pu hei pupuri? ( What is the point of owning our land if we have no guns to hold it? )
SUBTITLED: The MAORI NEGOTIATOR gets up to leave as do the others, STEWART snatches back his blankets and sulkily shakes them out to fold.
BAINES: kia Nihe. ( Give my regards to Chief Nihe. )
MAORI NEGOTIATOR: Ac ra. Kia Ora! Kia Ora! Te ( Yes indeed! Thank you. Thank you, Peini. ) Sc 73EXT BUSH AT NEW BOUNDARY MARKERSDAYSc 73 BAINES and STEWART walk through the bush. STEWART laden down with his blankets, red-faced and irritable.
STEWART: don't cultivate it, burn it back, anything. How do they even know it's theirs? BAINES stops as he comes to a freshly placed fence post. STEWART winds down his complaints watching BAINES anxiously. BAIXES walks down to the next one. he touches the freshly split post. ( tentatively ) I thought I might as well mark it out.
BAINES: the piano? BAINES keeps walking from post to post.
STEWART: the piano? BAINES keeps walking from post to post.
STEWART: play. what do you play.
BAINES: Sc 74EXT STEWARTS VEGETABLE PATCHDAYSc 74 ADA has cut a good sized cabbage in the vegetable patch. She throws it to FLORA who misses, dropping it in a pool of mud, spattering her face and dress. ADA smiles and FLORA who was about to cry gives the cabbage a big football beet towards her mother. ADA's mouth falls open, but then she too kicks it and they begin to dribble the mud caked cabbage towards the hut, all the time signing playful insults. Into this arrives STEWART.
STEWART: Sc 74EXT STEWARTS VEGETABLE PATCHDAYSc 74 ADA has cut a good sized cabbage in the vegetable patch. She throws it to FLORA who misses, dropping it in a pool of mud, spattering her face and dress. ADA smiles and FLORA who was about to cry gives the cabbage a big football beet towards her mother. ADA's mouth falls open, but then she too kicks it and they begin to dribble the mud caked cabbage towards the hut, all the time signing playful insults. Into this arrives STEWART.
STEWART: Is that right he can't play a We're going to lose that land, the way he was carrying on over Is he musical? You've got to teach him a song. Something FLORA has her foot on the cabbage, she nudges it off behind her. It roll down the hill. STEWART can't help but notice,
STEWART: He follows the cabbage down the hill' where he scrapes some of the mud This thing's been knocked to Sc 75 INT/EXT BAINES' HUT DAY Sc 75 FLORA is seen through BAINES' window Inside, ADA as ever charts her progress on the black keys, eleven. She turns to BAINES for instructions. BAINES is not himself, he is sulky and distant.
BAINES: ADA is perplexed by this turn about of behaviour. A little uncertainly, she sets about her playing. After a little she too turns to see what BAINES is doing. He's not there. She is surprised then anxious as she fears the deal may be off when there are flaw so few keys to go. She starts to play again, but her anxieties prove too great. She stops and listens. She looks out the window, where FLORA is mucking about in the yard. She walks to his bedroom, listens, then opens the door. BAINES stands naked looking at her. ADA is taken aback
BAINES: clothes on. How many would that ADA holds up ten fingers an impossibly high number of keys. BAINES nods. ADA is surprised; she didn't expect him to agree. ADA checks again holding up her hands.
BAINES: Hesitantly, she starts to undress. She lies on her petticoat, having deemed the bed too dirty. BAINES lies, very still on top of her. A scraping sound is heard. Sc 76 EXT/INT BAINES' HUT DAY Sc 76 FLORA is outside walking on sticks and logs trying to make sure she never puts her foot on the ground. She looks over at the house suddenly aware that the piano playing has stopped again. She investigates the mystery peeping through the various cracks and holes in the loosely built hut. Her vision is always only parts of bodies, the venture is one of challenge and curiosity. Sc 77 EXT NATIVE PINE FOREST DAY Sc 77 FLORA and three small Maori children play amongst some native pines. Two MAORI WOMEN smoke and chat nearby. The children rub up and down against the tree trunks kissing and hugging them. The game has an edge of promiscuity to it as they exchange trunks and hug one tree as a group. Unseen by the children STEWART marches towards FLORA. He pulls her off the tree.
STEWART: Never behave like that, never any where. You are greatly shamed and you have shamed those trunks. ( trees )
MAORI WOMEN: What o'clock say Mr Stewart? -Ge Tupeka? ( got tobacco? ) -Time for puff puff.
FLORA: ( sulkily ) I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano.
STEWART: You've missed this bit.
FLORA: She never gives him a turn. She just plays whatever she pleases, sometimes she doesn't play at all.
STEWART: And when is the next lesson?
FLORA: FLORA puts her bucket on her head to protect herself from the rain. Sc 80 EXT PATH TO BAINES' DAY Sc 8O The next day is very windy, the tops of trees are thrashed by fierce gusts of wind and some smaller branches crash to the ground. ADA's long dress and cape flap uncontrollably. FLORA's smaller cape stands out on end. Birds fly in mad wind-battered courses, swooped up then strangely drawn down. Sc 81 EXT BAINES' DAY Sc 81 ADA and FLORA arrive at BAINES' place to see the piano emerge from the hut carried by six MAORI MEN, one of whom does nothing but walk beside it "plonking" the keys. Another group of MAORIS sit cross-legged on the verandah playing draughts. Panicked ADA hurries down the hill to the hut. FLORA follows behind. Sc 82 INT BAINES' HUT DAY Sc 82 Inside the hut, HIRA, the old woman from the bathing spot, is smoking her pipe. ADA enters distraught and indicates what she has seen. Her face is flushed and whipped by the wind. She is much more expressive than normal.
BAINES: I am giving the piano back to you. I've had enough. The arrangement is making you a whore and me wretched. I want you to care for me, but you can't.
HIRA: ( softly ) George, can I use this
BAINES: It's yours, leave, go on go!
STEWART: ( stiffly from some distance ) Stop right there'. This isn't yours what are you doing with the piano?
FLORA: He's given it to us.
STEWART: ( out of breath ) Hah, you're very cunning Ada, but I've seen through you, I'm not going to lose the land this way. Wait
HIRA: George sick, he don't wanna see nobody. You got Tupeka for the
STEWART: I don't think you should have given up the piano. I will make sure you are properly taught, with music written on to sheets I don't want to learn.
BAINES: I don't want to learn.
STEWART: You don't want to learn.
BAINES: And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.
STEWART: And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.
BAINES: No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it.
STEWART: Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.
BAINES: It was more to your wife that I gave it.
STEWART: Well, thank you, I expect she will appreciate it. So that is agreed on?
HIRA: You make BIG mistake George. In first place you should swap land for wife. Now look, she gone, you no land, no music box, you got nothing.
STEWART: Is it all right? Aren't you going to play something?
FLORA: She looks to ADA, who looks back through her not concentrating.
STEWART: FLORA starts a song, ADA walks past them out of the hut, STEWART ignores her exit moving up to lean on the piano. ADA is seen through the hut window wandering amidst the ghostly, blackened trunks. STEWART'S attention is drawn to ADA, he interrupts FLORA'S singing with a sudden outburst.

STEWART: play it? We have it back, and she just wanders off! FLORA stops to watch her mother through the window. ADA looks towards the house as the music stops.
STEWART: Grimly STEWART slaps the top of the piano to FLORA's playing. ADA continues to walk, her face dark and puzzled. She stops. Her head stiffly, irresistibly, lifts and turns in the direction BAINES' hut. She peers deep into the bush as if attempting to penetrate a puzzle. She thinks and walks on. Sc 88 INT STEWART'S KITCHEN DAY Sc 88 The next day ADA and her piano face each other across the kitchen. A slit of light falls across the piano highlighting it's rosey walnut wood. ADA's expression is critical and distant. Taking a cloth she begins to clean and polish the piano. Her finger holds down one of the keys and we glimpse an old inscription on its side, a small heart, and an arrow. Putting the cloth aside she sits at the piano to begin playing. She starts with wholehearted feeling, her eyes closed, but before long she is surprised by a moving reflection across the piano and she 'starts', glancing over her shoulder. She stops and begins again. But once more a reflex has her glance across her left shoulder and she pauses in her playing. Disquieted she starts again and again she looks away. She stops, confused, unable to go on, unable to getup, one hand on the lid and one on the piano keys. Sc 89 EXT PATH TO BAINES' DAY Sc 89 ADA carrying her cape and bonnet hurries through the narrow bush path to BAINES' hut, FLORA has a fist of her skirt and is pulling back. ADA turns on FLORA and snatches the skirt out of the girl's hand. ADA signs to her and continues on.
FLORA: ADA signs again.
FLORA: practise and I DON'T CARE! But ADA does not wait to listen. FLORA walks back through the bush muttering childish expletives to herself. STEWART and his two MAORI helpers come out of the bush towards her. FLORA squeals with fright.
STEWART: your mother? Where has she FLORA pauses petulant and grumpy.
FLORA: To HELL! So what brings you here? Did you leave something? I have not found anything. Does he know something? The piano is not harmed? It arrived safely? Would you like to sit? I am going to sit.
BAINES: So what brings you here? Did you leave something? I have not found anything. Does he know something? The piano is not harmed? It arrived safely? Would you like to sit? I am going to sit.
BAINES: Ada, I am unhappy because I want you, because my mind has seized on you and thinks of nothing else. This is how I suffer, I am sick with longing. I don't eat, I don't sleep. If you do not want me, if you have come with no feeling for me, then go! Go! Go NOW! Leave!
BAINES: What? What? whisper.. Now you are going I am miserable, why is that? ( He catches her hand and draws her to hint ) Ada I need to know, what will you do? Will you come Wait! I don't know what you're thinking. ( gently, teasingly ) Does this mean something to you? Hey? ( Stroking a strand of hair behind her ear ) I already miss you. Ada, do you love me? ( anxiously ) Come tomorrow. If you are serious, come tomorrow.

BAINES: ( anxiously ) Come tomorrow. If you are serious, come tomorrow.
BAINES: She nods and is gone. Sc 94 INT STEWART'S HUT ADA'S BEDROOMNIGHTSc 94 FLORA and ADA are both in their white nightgowns. FLORA stands behind ADA on a chair trying to sort out the knots that have matted at the back of ADA's head. ADA shakes her head from side to side playfully, making the difficult job impossible.
FLORA: Stay still! It's the very worst
FLORA: Mama STOP IT!
FLORA: Stop it I feel sick!
FLORA: ( TOP OF HER LUNGS ) Mumma! Mumma! They are playing your
FLORA: Here Papa!
FLORA: You shouldn't have gone up there, should you? I don't like it and nor does Papa. Mama, we can play cards together.
FLORA: She is asleep, look. You are letting the clothes float off. They are floating
STEWART: You are letting the clothes float off. They are floating
FLORA: Mama! Look out!
FLORA: One, two, three One, two, three
STEWART: But ADA scowls and pulls away roughly, STEWART lies back anxious not to break the spell and when he is still ADA continues to caress his chest. His eyes well with tears and he looks up into her face like a child after a bad dream, fearful and trusting. ADA continues like a nurse spreading ointment on a wound, tenderly and attentively she strokes down towards his belly. STEWART'S skin goose bumps and be shudders. He puts his hand on hers to still it1 she slides hers out and continues stroking. He looks at her pleadingly and childlike, she stops and kisses the soft skin of his belly, STEWART groans clutching the mattress. ADA seems removed from STEWART as if she has a separate curiosity of her own. Sc 105INT STEWART'S KITCHEN DAY Sc 105 Next day AUNT MORAG stands circling in STEWART'S small darkened house. FLORA and ADA sit quietly together
AUNT MORAG: Ohhh, it's so dark, it's like a dank cave.
NESSIE: Yes, like a cave.
AUNT MORAG: Ohh no, it makes my skin creep!
AUNT MORAG: Alisdair, is it because of our play? Have the natives aggressed you?
NESSIE: ( nodding her head in imitation ) . you are quite trapped.
AUNT MORAG: We have just come from George Banes' and they have taken him over. It is no wonder he is leaving, he has got in too deep with the natives. They sit on his floor as proud as Kings, but without a shred of manners.
NESSIE: ( in unison ) . without a shred of manners.
AUNT MORAG: He is quite altered, as if they had been trying some native witchcraft on him. Well tomorrow or the day after he will be gone.
STEWART: Baines is packing up?
AUNT MORAG: Well he has NOTHING to pack, but he is leaving. And it is just as well; Nessie has foolishly grown an affection for him . we have had some
AUNT MORAG: ( very firmly ) STOP IT! STOP! I am quite frightened of the way back, we must leave in good light. Will we be safe?
STEWART: ( wanting them gone ) If you leave soon, yes, I am sure of
AUNT MORAG: You know I am thinking of the piano. She does not play the piano as we do Nessie. UP! UP! No she is a strange creature and her saying is strange like a mood that passes into you. You cannot teach that Nessie, one may like to learn but that could not be taught. Up! Your playing is plain and true and that is what I like. To have a sound creep inside you is not all pleasant what is that?
NESSIE: ( frightened ) Ohhhhhh!
STEWART: I've been hoping you would
STEWART: I want to touch you Why can't I touch you? Do you like me? Do you? Why? Why not?!
FLORA: and then I'm going to make a serpent to live here, with a very long tongue. ( She pokes her tongue out and waggles it ). STEWART reads, he glances at ADA who is glum and lifeless. Sc 109INT STEWART'S HUT DAY Sc 109 ADA and FLORA wake to sunlight streaming in on their faces, more and more of it as STEWART rips the boards from the windows FLORA runs about in nightgown and boots happy to be in the sunlight. ADA winds her hair into a bun. STEWART walks inside, he packs food and fencing Sc 110EXT STEWART'S DAY Sc 110 ADA hangs out washing restlessly scanning the bushline. A tiny STEWART walks along the crest of the hill, eventually dropping out of sight. Sc 111INT STEWART'S HUT DAY Sc 111 Inside the hut ADA is pacing, anguished and frustrated. Impulsively she picks up a knife from the kitchen table, opens the back of the piano and cuts one of the keys loose. Carefully she engraves on the side in Victorian handscript. DEAR GEORGE, YOU HAVE MY HEART. ADA McGRATH. Sc 112EXT STEWART'S DAY Sc 112 Under the sheets FLORA has constructed a dolls' clothes line on which she hangs small strips of cloth ADA hands her the key wrapped and tied in white cotton. ADA signs. Her black shadow behind the sheet recalls the macabre play. The little girl continues defiantly with her miniature washing. ADA rips the washing line up and flings it aside. FLORA is shocked, stunned. She takes the key and walking off she turns and shouts.
STEWART: ( Clears his throat ) We must both get on. I have decided to trust you to stay here. You will not see Baines? ( ADA nods ) Good, good. Perhaps with more trying you will come to like me?
FLORA: We're not supposed to visit The grand old Duke of York. He had ten thousand men etc.
FLORA: The grand old Duke of York. He had ten thousand men etc.
FLORA: Mumma wanted me to give this to Mr. Baines. I thought maybe it was not a proper thing to do. Shall I open it?
STEWART: He stops and takes the key, suspicious and uncomfortable. He slowly unwraps it and turning it over reads it. Squeezing the key in his fist, STEWART staggers off in a daze, He returns, picks up his open pack spilling the nails. Finally he drops the pack and the key ) and leaves with only his axe. FLORA follows confused. The MAORIS waste no time investigating the booty. MANA presses the piano key repeatedly.
MANA: Knare e Wainta! Kaare e Wajata! ( no sing, no sing )
STEWART: ( exasperated ) why? WHY? I trusted you!
WHY?: ADA runs forward to restrain him, but it sinks deep into the wood. The struck piano lets ont a strange resonant moan. He takes her by the wrist. STEWART shakes her violently. Sc 119EXT STEWART'S HUT & WOODCHOPDAY Sc 119 He pulls her out of the hut, past the now terrified FLORA. He drags her out through the mud, towards the wood chop. It is raining ADA sees where they are headed and suddenly she is very scared. She bucks and struggles, but STEWART is infinitely stronger. At the wood chop she breaks free and crawls away through the woodchips and mud. But axe in hand he grasps her by the neck of her dregs, then her hair, and pulls her backwards towards the cutting block. There, he takes her right hand and holds it in place with his boot, so that only ADA's index finger shows, ADA's head is held twisted between the wood chop and STEWART'S leg.
STEWART: ( anguished ) Do you love him? Do you?! Is it him you love?
FLORA: No, she says NOOOOOO!!!
FLORA: ( Screaming ) Mother!!
FLORA: ADA keeps walking blindly like her being depends on it. Her face is ashen, her eyes fearful as she walks unseeingly straight into a large tree stump. She sinks into the mud. STEWART wraps the finger in a white handkerchief and gives it to FLORA who backs away from him terrified.
FLORA: ( quietly ) Mama.
STEWART: Take this to Baines. Tell him if he ever tries to see her again I'll take off another and another and another!
HIRA: I worry for us Peini. Pakeha cunning like wind, KNOCK you over, yet you not see it. Some they say, how can pakeha get our land if we won't sell it?"
HIRA: They wrong Peini. We need guns to hold it.

UNSUBTITLED: Sc 122EXT MAORI PA DAY Sc 122 Outside the Pa walls near the kumera gardens, HIRA holds BAINES' saddle bags. It is raining hard as he rides out, hatless, shoeless and gunless, but clutching to his chest ADA's engraved key.
HIRA: Go Peini . Haere atu e Peini.
BAINES: I'll be back.
BAINES: Can you read?
TREE GIRL: I can.
BAINES: You can read?
TREE GIRL: Yes . lots of things.

STEWART: ( speaking to his feet ) I lost my temper. I'm sorry.
STEWART: You broke my trust, you pushed me hard, to hard. ( he sighs ) You cannot send love to HIM you cannot do it. Even to think on it makes me angry, very angry
STEWART: I meant to love you. I clipped your wing, that is all.
STEWART: We shall be together, you will see it will be better.
STEWART: ( whispering ) . my love bird.
STEWART: Ohhhhh my love
STEWART: You are feeling better?
STEWART: The sound of his own voice makes him blink. He watches her as if listening to her speak in a voice that is so faint, and distant, that only with great concentration and perseverance can he make it out. As he watches her his face transforms; his eyes fill, his lips soften and his eyebrows take on the exact expression of her own. The kerosene lamp burns fitfully, fluttering a light pulse across their faces. STEWART moves closer to ADA. Outside a wind bangs the iron roof and rubs branches against each other making a high-pitched see-saw sound. He leans closer still. Sc 134EXT STEWARTS NIGHT Sc 134 STEWART carrying a candle in a glass box makes his way through ghostly tree stumps. In his other arm he has his gun. Sc 135EXT/INT BAINES' NIGHT Sc 135 At BAINES' hut STEWART steps over the curled figure of HIRA sleeping on the verandah and walks through the hut towards the bedroom where a lit candle flickers. Sc 136INT BAINES' BEDROOMNIGHT Sc 136 In the bed lies FLORA wrapped in a blanket with BAINES beside her, axe in hand, both fast asleep. STEWART nudges BAINES awake with the butt of his rifle prodding him under the chin. BAINES wakes rudely with a start, frozen by the sight of STEWART and his rifle.
STEWART: Put that away, on the floor.
STEWART: I look at you, at your face. I have had that face in my head hating it. But now I am here seeing it . it's nothing, you blink, you have your mark, you look at me through your eyes, yes. you are even scared of me
STEWART: Look at you!
STEWART: ( softly ) Has Ada ever spoken to you?
BAINES: You mean in signs?
STEWART: No, words. You have never heard No, not words.
BAINES: No, not words.
STEWART: Never thought you heard words?
STEWART: ( slowly ) She has spoken to me. I heard her voice. There was no sound, but I beard it here ( he presses his forehead with a palm of his hand ). Her voice was there in my head. I watched her lips, they did not make the words, yet the harder I listened the clearer I heard her, as clear as I hear you, as dear as I hear my own voice.
BAINES: ( trying to understand ) Spoken words?
STEWART: No, but her words are in my head. ( he looks at BAINES and pauses ) I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words.
BAINES: ( suspiciously ) What are they?
STEWART: She said, "I have to go, let me go, let Baines take me away, let him try and save me. I am frightened of my will, of what it might do it is so strange and strong".
BAINES: You punished her wrongly, it was me, my fault. Understand me. I am here for her, for her I wonder that I don't wake, that I am not asleep to be here talking with you. I love her. But what is the use? She doesn't care for me. I wish her gone. I wish you gone. I want to wake and find it was a dream, that is what I want. I want to believe I am not this man. I want my self back; the one I know.
