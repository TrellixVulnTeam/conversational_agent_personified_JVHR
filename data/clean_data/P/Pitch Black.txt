PITCH BLACK: David Twohy
FRY: Hear me? Cap'n? Some kinda compromise to the hull.holding for now, but.Goddamn, I'm glad you're alive. Gotta pull your E-release.no, red handle, red handle. I'll get the warm-ups out while
OWENS: Why did I fall on you?
FRY: He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when
OWENS: I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean, I mean, why did I fall at all?
FRY: You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
OWENS: Oh, no. Not Owens, not.. Wai', wai', wait. I'm Owens. Right? Cryo-sleep. Swear to God, it sloughs brain cells.
FRY: Cryo-sleep. Swear to God, it sloughs brain cells.
FRY: 1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. Somethin' took a swipe at us.
OWENS: Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space..
FRY: Jesus God..
FRY?: She doesn't answer.
OWENS: . crisis program selected Number Two of this system because it shows at least some oxygen and more than 1,500 would you
OWENS: .showing no major water bodies.maximum terrain, 220 meters over mean surface. largely cinder and gypsum with some evaporite deposits..
OWENS: Fry? What're you doing?
OWENS: Can't get my nose down.too much load back there..
FRY: Can't get my nose down.too much load back there..
OWENS: You mean that "load" of passengers?
FRY: So what, we should both go down too? Out of sheer fucking nobility?
RELEASE.": INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY
OWENS: Look, Fry. Company says we're responsible for every one of those
FRY: Company's not here, is it?
OWENS: When captain went down, you stepped up whether you like it or not. Now they train you for this, so
FRY: And there wasn't a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site! That's how they train you! On a fucking simulator!
OWENS: Don't touch that switch!
FRY: I'm not dying for them.
FRY: 70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to level this beast out!
OWENS: 70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to level this beast out!
BLACKOUT: INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY Choking yellow dust. Ghostly silhouettes are COUGHING, MOANING, CALLING OUT to other survivors in English and, surreally, in Arabic. Soon we find. Johns. Ears running blood. Stumbling his way to. Riddick's cryo-locker. Empty. Johns reaches for his holster. Gone, torn right off his belt. No prisoner and no weapon spooky combination. Nearby he sees. The light of a cutting torch. Someone's using it to open a jammed cryo-locker. The plexi is torched away to reveal. AUDREY, 12 years old. Unscathed.
AUDREY: Somethin' went wrong, huh?
JOHNS: One chance and you blew it, Riddick. Never cease to disappoint me.
JOHNS: Hey, who?
JOHNS: Amazing. I'm Johns.
FRY: Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but.
FRY: Are there any others, Johns?
OWENS: Out, out, out, GET IT OUTTA ME!
VOICES: Pull it out of him.No, it's too close to the heart.You gotta do it, just do it
OWENS: Don't touch it! Don't touch that switch!
VOICES: You'll kill him, I'm tellin' you, shit, just leave it alone.delirious.doncha you got some drugs for this poor man..
OWENS: Don't touch that switch!
FRY: Awright, awright, someone.there's Anestaphine in the med-lock, that end of the cabin.next to..
FRY: Get away. Everybody.
PARIS: Well. Our own little slice of heaven.
IMAM: Please.which way to New Mecca? We must know the direction in order to pray.
JOHNS: Big talk about a scouting party.
PARIS: Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me?
AUDREY: Like I just ran, or something..
SHAZZA: Feel one lung short. All of us.
PARIS: Well, I tend toward the asthmatic. And with all this dust..
FRY: It's the atmosphere. Too much pressure, not enough oxygen. Might take a few days So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
ZEKE: So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
FRY: Somethin' knocked us off-lane. Maybe a rogue comet. Maybe we'll never know.
SHAZZA: Well, I for one, am thoroughly fucking grateful. This beast wasn't made to land like this. But cripes, you rode it down. C'mon, you lousy ingrates, only reason we're alive is a'cuzza her.
FRY: Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start ripping them out. Quick hits only try to make it last.
AUDREY: Well, is someone coming for us? Or are we all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse? Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring We're worried you'll scare us. Name's "Audrey," right, love? And you're goin' to Taurus Three like we were?
SHAZZA: We're worried you'll scare us. Name's "Audrey," right, love? And you're goin' to Taurus Three like we were?
AUDREY: Yeah, but.do we even have enough food to get there? Or will we have to resort to cannibalism?
ZEKE: ( to Fry )
FRY: And him?
JOHNS: Big Evil?
FRY: We just keep him locked up forever?
JOHNS: Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on
FRY: I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
JOHNS: Only around humans.
FRY: Oh, Christ..
FRY: Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything to drink!
PARIS: Mine here..
FRY: Little swamp-flu from the Conga system. Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.
JOHNS: Little swamp-flu from the Conga system. Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.
JOHNS: King Tut's tomb..
PARIS: Be surprised what these will fetch in the Taurus system. Here. This Wooten here easy, easy. Very rare.
FRY: This is it? Booze? to drink?
PARIS: ( educating her )
JOHNS: ( cracking a bottle )
PARIS: I'll need a receipt for that. For all these.
FRY: Top of my list.
FRY: I don't suppose..
IMAM: One of the Christian habits we adopt perhaps unfortunately. We'll have to wait.
JOHNS: For what? There is no water. You understand that, don't you?
IMAM: All deserts have water, somewhere. God shall lead us there.
JOHNS: Like we needed another way to die.
JOHNS: What the hell are these?
PARIS: Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare.
ZEKE: An' this?
PARIS: Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very very rare, since the tribe's 'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess.
ZEKE: 'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess.
PARIS: Well, what's the need, anyway? If he's gone, he's gone. Why should he bother us?
JOHNS: First, because he can only live out there for so long he's gonna come back and take what we got. Second, for the sheer thrill of the kill.
FRY: Imam. We should leave soon. Before nightfall but while it's cooler.
ZEKE: What, you're goin' off, too?
FRY: Johns is leaving you a gun. Just do me a favor, huh? Get my crewies buried? They were good guys who died bad.
SHAZZA: A'course we will.
SHAZZA: My bloody oath..
AUDREY: Three suns?
ZEKE: ( to Fry )
PARIS: So much for my cocktail hour.
IMAM: We take this to be a good sign a path, a direction from God.
JOHNS: A very good sign. That's Riddick's direction. You do not wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.
FRY: Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
JOHNS: ( nodding )
FRY: So quiet. You get used to the sounds of the ship, then..
IMAM: You know who Muhammad was?
FRY: Some prophet guy?
IMAM: "Some prophet guy." And a city man. But he had to travel to the desert where there was quiet to hear the words of You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?
FRY: You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?
IMAM: ( nodding )
FRY: Frightening thought.
IMAM: ( finishes wrapping her )
FRY: ( hands her scope )
JOHNS: ( hands her scope )
FRY: EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY Paris has taken over as look-out atop the ship. He deals with the heat by erecting a "misting" umbrella: He fills a reservoir with liquor, dials up a regulator. Umbrella spars shoot bursts of cooling alcohol vapor. Paris luxuriates in it.
PARIS: Amazing how you can do without the essentials of life so long as you have the luxuries.
ZEKE: Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes open. Don't want that ratbag sneakin' up on me bloody-fuckin' arse. He'd probably get you right here, right under the jaw. And you'd never hear him coming. That's how good Riddick is.
AUDREY: He'd probably get you right here, right under the jaw. And you'd never hear him coming. That's how good Riddick is.
PARIS: Now did you run away from your parents? Or did they run away from you?
PILGRIMS: Allahu Akbar.Allahu Akbar..
FRY: Is this whole planet dead?
IMAM: He asks what could have killed so many great things.
IMAM: Some.communal graveyard, perhaps. like the elephants of Earth..
JOHNS: Long time ago. Whatever happened.
PILGRIM #1: He looks for Pilgrim #3 but can't spot him. And when he turns back to the skull a face is staring through the combing. But it's only.
FRY: Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.
JOHNS: Probably right.
FRY: Better keep moving..
JOHNS: What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching the switch?
FRY: Promise me. Swear to me you won't
JOHNS: You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
FRY: During the landing.when things were at their worst.Owens was at his best. He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin.
JOHNS: Hold up.
FRY: Thought he might be coolin' it in the boneyard could either double-back to the ship or slip in behind us. So I left the bottle out as bait.
JOHNS: Thought he might be coolin' it in the boneyard could either double-back to the ship or slip in behind us. So I left the bottle out as bait.
PILGRIM #1: The Chrislams have found what appears to be a small desert plant. Leathery petals are spread wide, revealing a round stringy core. ARABIC DISCUSSION. Desert fruit? Is it edible?
FRY: Wait, wait, wait..
IMAM: We are not alone here, yes?
JOHNS: Never thought we were.
PILGRIM #1: Assalamoo ahlaykum!
PILGRIM #2: Assalamoo ahlaykum!
JOHNS: Long gone. Whoever they were.
IMAM: Water.water there was here..
PILGRIMS: Allahu Akbar..
IMAM: ( translating )
JOHNS: I'm born-again.
FRY: No response to her command. She pats around for old-style wall switches. Nothing. Perceiving black-out blinds on a window, she throws them open to reveal. A man standing right outside.
JOHNS: ( through window )
FRY: No darkness. No lights because no
FRY: Allahu Akbar!
PARIS: This now qualifies as the worst fun I've ever had. Stop it.
PARIS: Audrey? Oh, Audrey..
PARIS: Tell me that was you.
AUDREY: Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
PARIS: Assailing my fragile sense of security, that's what.
SHAZZA: What're you goin' on about? She's been right here for the last..
SHAZZA: ( a quiet probe )
AUDREY: Facing them is a TOTAL STRANGER burned, half naked, one hand still clutching the emergency-release lever of his cryo-locker. Shazza stopped one inch short of killing him.
TOTAL STRANGER: I thought.my God, I thought I was the only one who..
PARIS: Oh, Lord..
AUDREY: It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just..
ZEKE: Cripes galore, I thought it was him. The murderin' ratbag. I thought he was..
FRY: No juice, looks like it's been laid up for years. But we might be able to Shut up.
JOHNS: Shut up.
FRY: Like what?
JOHNS: Like my pistola.
ZEKE: Now what the bloody hell..
JOHNS: Same crap, different planet, huh?
JOHNS: .I don't play that.I don't play that so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell me a better lie..
FRY: Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me
SHAZZA: What'd you do with 'im? You bloody sick animal you, what'dja do with me Zeke?
FRY: He used that?
JOHNS: Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
FRY: So why isn't it all bloody?
JOHNS: I assume he licked it clean.
FRY: So where is he?
FRY: Tell me about the sounds. You told them you heard something right before.. If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take another crack at it at your skull.
RIDDICK: 'Mean the whispers?
FRY: What whispers?
RIDDICK: The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta. What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt, so I used it to catch a little run-off. Metallic taste to it, human blood. Coppery. But if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. Course, that's more for winter. Summertime, I take mine straight.
FRY: Why don't we try the truth now?
RIDDICK: All you people are so scared of me an' most days, I'd take that as a compliment but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.
FRY: Show me your eyes.
FRY: Imagine a virgin undressing in front of someone for the first time. That's how Riddick opens his eyes, startling us: No irises, just huge black-pool pupils. And from deep within, a jewel-like eyeshine. His eyes are as beautiful and unsettling as those of a starved jaguar.
FRY: You did this? To yourself?
RIDDICK: Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
FRY: Heard about it. Just never seen it.
RIDDICK: Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up then you wind up here. Three ass-kick Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time.
FRY: Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.
RIDDICK: Look deeper.
JOHNS: guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and now he's trying to
FRY: Let's just be sure.
JOHNS: belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into
FRY: you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this? We gotta go down and find it.
JOHNS: Well, don't ask me to.
FRY: Thought you didn't believe his story.
JOHNS: I don't. But that ground looked none too stable, and I don't want anyone
AUDREY: If you're afraid, I'll go.
FRY: Nobody else is going down but me, okay?
JOHNS: ( pulling her aside )
FRY: What, you think I'm doin' this to prove You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another.
JOHNS: You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another.
FRY: Thanks for the tip, Johns.
FRY: They're hollow..
FRY: Here! I'm in HERE, HERE, HERE!
IMAM: Did you hear..
FRY: I'm over here in the
FRY: Oh, God..
JOHNS: We got you.it's okay, it's okay.we got you now..
IMAM: The child heard you before any of us could Did you find him? You find Zeke?
SHAZZA: Did you find him? You find Zeke?
FRY: ( half insane )
IMAM: One is all?
FRY: For now.
RIDDICK: Found somethin' worse than me, huh?
JOHNS: We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now.
RIDDICK: Woof, woof.
JOHNS: Want you to remember this moment, Riddick. The way it coulda gone and didn't.
RIDDICK: ( deaf )
JOHNS: Here's the deal. You work without the chains, without the bit without the shivs. You help us get off this rock..
RIDDICK: For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?
JOHNS: Truth is, Riddick, I'm tired of this head-up shit. I wanna be free of you as much as you wanna be free of me.
RIDDICK: You'd cut me loose, Boss?
JOHNS: Only if we both get outta this alive. And there may be a way.
RIDDICK: ( staring at hand )
JOHNS: If you were me, I'd kill us both. C'mon, you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?
RIDDICK: Want you to remember this moment.
PARIS: ( to Johns )
JOHNS: Didn't say that. But least this way I don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up.
IMAM: Well, I feel we owe Mr. Riddick amends.
SHAZZA: Oh, right. Let's all line up and beg his forgiveness. Right you are.
IMAM: At least give the man some oxygen..
JOHNS: He's happy just bein' vertical. Leave him So I can talk to him now?
AUDREY: So I can talk to him now?
PARIS: Paris P. Ogilvie. Antiquities dealer, Richard B. Riddick. Escaped convict,
RIDDICK: ( shaking hands )
PARIS: You know, if I owned Hell and this planet.I believe I'd rent this out and live in Hell.
PARIS: I mean, usually I can appreciate antiques, but, uh..
JOHNS: Little ratty-ass.
FRY: Nothing we can't repair so long as the electrical adapts.
SHAZZA: Not a star-jumper.
RIDDICK: Doesn't need to be. Use this to get back up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick out a thumb. You'll get picked up.
FRY: Little help here?
JOHNS: Check those containers for me. See what we can patch wings with.
FRY: Okay, that should buy us a sys-check. But we'll need more cells.
JOHNS: How many?
FRY: 15 6-gigs here.90 gigs total.other ship carries 20-gig cells, so.five. Five total to launch.
JOHNS: 25 kilos each, huh?
SHAZZA: Old sand-cat outside. See if I can't get it up and chuggin'.
JOHNS: Do it. And if you need an extra hand, tap our problem child out.. Where's Riddick?
ROBOT: ".to all intruders. I am the guardian of this land. I will protect my masters at all cost. Death to all intruders."
RIDDICK: Missin' the party. C'mon.
IMAM: .and for this, our gift of drink, we give thanks in the name of our Prophet, Muhammad, peace be upon him, and to our Lord, Jesus Christ of Nazareth, and to his father, Allah the Compassionate and the The strangest religion..
PARIS: ( to himself )
PARIS: Perhaps we should toast our hosts. Who were these people, anyway? Miners?
SHAZZA: Looks like geologists. Advance team, moves around from rock to rock.
JOHNS: Musta crapped out here, huh?
AUDREY: But why did they leave their ship?
JOHNS: ( answering Audrey )
PARIS: Like an emergency life-raft, right?
SHAZZA: Sure. Coulda had a real drop-ship take them off-planet. Long gone.
PARIS: A toast to their ghosts, then..
RIDDICK: Didn't leave, these people. Whatever got Zeke got them. They're all dead.
SHAZZA: Maybe they had weight limits, you don't I know you don't uncrate your emergency ship unless there's a fucking emergency.
RIDDICK: I know you don't uncrate your emergency ship unless there's a fucking emergency.
JOHNS: Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your theories on
FRY: ( to Riddick )
IMAM: Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?
RIDDICK: ( to Fry
IMAM: INT. CORING ROOM - DAY CHAOTIC SHOTS: More NESTS EXPLODE into individual creatures, winged hatchlings moving like bats in a fire, talons hacking and slashing. His exit blocked, Pilgrim #3 veers into. A dark supply room. He slams the door, MUMBLES A BLESSING and waits for the storm to pass. He's been cut but at least he's still alive.
IMAM: A NOISE from the supply room. Is it Ali? Just too scared to come out? Imam opens the door. And hatchlings pour out. Moving with a gang-intelligence, they circle the room in a wave, soar high into the rafters then plunge into the coring shaft, SQUEALS VANISHING to infinity. Shocked silence, then. Pilgrim #3 tumbles to the ground. He's been shredded into bloody kite-tails. There was a nest inside the supply room. Imam falls on him in grief. Johns and Fry inch forward to peer The coring shaft. It's littered with human bones. The skeletons of the settlers. Scattered about and picked clean.
SHAZZA: Why was the door chained up? Why the bloody hell would they lock themselves in like that?
JOHNS: Not sure, but tell you what: Chrislams better not be diggin' another grave out Other buildings weren't secure.
SHAZZA: So that's what come of me Zeke. An' you saw it. You was right there.
RIDDICK: ( shrugging, ( a beat )
SHAZZA: Take it.
RIDDICK: ( suspicious )
SHAZZA: Startin' to acclimate, anyhow. Take it.
JOHNS: ( to Fry )
FRY: 60 years ago.
JOHNS: Coring samples line the room, laid out on counters. Fry's been scrutinizing them.
FRY: Core-samples are dated. Last one is 60 years ago. This month.
SHAZZA: Yeah? What's special about that?
FRY: Dunno. Maybe nothing, but..
JOHNS: Are you fuckin' kidding me?
RIDDICK: Not afraid of the dark, are you?
FRY: .need those cells from the crash ship. Shit, still gotta check out the hull, patch the wings
JOHNS: Let's wait on the power cells.
FRY: Wait for what? Until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to
JOHNS: We're not sure What's the discussion?
FRY: What's the discussion?
JOHNS: Ever tell you how Riddick escaped?
FRY: ( jarred )
JOHNS: Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.
FRY: ( with faint hope )
JOHNS: He also figured out how to kill the pilot,
FRY: You said we were going to trust him now. You said there was a deal.
JOHNS: That's what I said.
FRY: Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns.
JOHNS: May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he stops You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
FRY: You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
FRY: You know, he hasn't harmed any of us. Far as I can tell, he hasn't even lied to us. Just stick to the deal, Johns. Let him go if that's what it
JOHNS: He's a murderer. The law says he's gotta do his bid.
FRY: Dancin' on razor blades here.
JOHNS: I won't give him a chance to grab another ship or to slash another pilot's throat.
RIDDICK: Bad sign. Shakin' like that in this heat.
RIDDICK: ( looking after Johns )
FRY: They're coming.
RIDDICK: Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet. Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
FRY: I got the quick-and-ugly version.
RIDDICK: An' now you're worried about a repeat of Entered our minds.
FRY: Entered our minds.
RIDDICK: I asked what
FRY: You scare me, Riddick. That's what you wanna hear, isn't it? There, I admit it, Can I get back to work now?
RIDDICK: Think Johns is an do-right man? You think I can trust him to cut me loose?
FRY: Why, what'd you hear?
RIDDICK: Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd just do me, huh? Then again.I am worth twice as much alive. Didn't know? Johns ain't a cop. Oh, he's got that shiny badge an' all, but nah he's just a merc and I'm just a payday. That's why he won't kill me. The creed is
FRY: Save it, Riddick. We aren't gonna turn on each other no matter how hard you try.
RIDDICK: I don't truly know what's gonna happen when the lights go out, Carolyn but I do know that once the dyin' starts, this little psycho family of ours is gonna rip itself apart. So you better find out the truth. Come nightfall, you better know exactly who's standing behind you.
RIDDICK: Oh, ask him 'bout those shakes. And ask why your crew-pal had to scream like that 'fore he died.
JOHNS: I never said I was.
FRY: Never said you were a hype, either.
JOHNS: You have a little caffeine in the morning, I have a little morphine. So what?
FRY: And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you born lucky?
JOHNS: Not a problem unless you're gonna make
FRY: ( lashing )
JOHNS: Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact.
FRY: Johns? Christ, here I am lettin' you play games with our lives when
JOHNS: My first run-in with Riddick. Went for the sweet-spot and missed. They had to leave a piece of the shiv in there. I can feel it, sometimes, pressing against the So maybe the care and feeding of my nerve-endings is my business.
FRY: You coulda helped. And you didn't.
JOHNS: Yeah, well, look to thine own ass first. Right, "captain"?
PARIS: What do my eyes see?
FRY: It's starting..
SHAZZA: ( to Fry )
FRY: LET'S GET THOSE CELLS!
SHAZZA: We stay together! C'mon!
RIDDICK: Don't wanna miss this.
AUDREY: Lookit. Lookit!
FRY: Don't stop, don't stop..
JOHNS: Jesus, how many can there..
PARIS: Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.
FRY: Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.
AUDREY: Tell her to stay there. Stay down.
FRY: No, no, NO, NO, NO..
FRY: What is it? What's happening?
RIDDICK: Like I said. Ain't me you gotta worry
AUDREY: What if.what if she's still out there. still alive..
JOHNS: Well, I don't want to jump to conclusions here.but 'member that boneyard? These just might be the fuckers that killed every other living thing on this planet, okay? Chances of Shazza knockin' on that door anytime soon are just about zero I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn't a natural die-off.
FRY: ( agreeing )
IMAM: Quiet, please. Everyone.
AUDREY: ( whispering )
IMAM: Perhaps the way they see. With sound, reflecting back.
FRY: ( realizing )
FRY: Breach in the hull. I dunno.
JOHNS: I'd rather piss glass.
RIDDICK: Well, you got the big gauge.
JOHNS: Wanna rag your fat mouth?
AUDREY: Maybe it's just their beads again. Imam, are you still
IMAM: No, no, no, I do not believe
JOHNS: C'mon, man, you're drivin' everybody bugfuck with those things. Why don't you just lose the goddamn..
RIDDICK: Big beads.
JOHNS: ( to others )
JOHNS: Very big beads.
PARIS: Not staying in here another..
FRY: Christ, you don't know what's out there!
PARIS: I know what's in here!
IMAM: Everybody come, this way and we should be safe. Hurry, please..
RIDDICK: ( to Johns )
PARIS: Hello, hello?
RIDDICK: Don't. Move.
FRY: Imam? Where are they?
RIDDICK: The predators are on him, just blurs in the dark. DEATH-SCREAM. RIDDICK'S POV: A third predator appears above him. Making his move, Riddick darts around cargo and heads for the escape hatch as. Fry's light catches him square in the face. Blinded, Riddick HOWLS and stumbles forward. Fry's light leaps deeper to hit. The predator right behind him. With a similar reaction, the beast HOWLS and flails back. HOLD on Fry for a time-stopped moment. What stopped it? Was it really her? Suddenly a SHOTGUN EXPLODES beside her head. Jacked up, Johns is BLASTING shadows.
FRY: Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!
JOHNS: 'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
FRY: Like the light is scalding it.
PARIS: Like the light is scalding it.
FRY: It hurts them. Light actually hurts
IMAM: Is that.Hasan?
JOHNS: We'll burn a candle for him later. C'mon.
FRY: .one cutting torch.one handlight here, two more in the cabin.I think two Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns How many bottles?
PARIS: Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns How many bottles?
FRY: How many bottles?
PARIS: Not sure. Ten?
FRY: Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn? If you got a receipt?
PARIS: Awright. So maybe we'll have enough light.
FRY: Awright. So maybe we'll have enough light.
JOHNS: Enough for what?
FRY: ( to others )
PARIS: I hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact, but that sand-cat won't run at We'll have to carry the cells.drag them.whatever it takes.
FRY: We'll have to carry the cells.drag them.whatever it takes.
AUDREY: You mean.tonight? With all those things still out there?
PARIS: Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.
JOHNS: Back it up. How long can this last? Few minutes? Couple hours?
IMAM: I had the impression.from the model. that the two planets were moving as one. That there would be.a lasting darkness.
JOHNS: Those suns gotta come back if these animals really are phobic about light, we just sit tight till then.
FRY: I'm sure that's what someone else said. Locked inside that coring room.
JOHNS: Look, we gotta think about everyone now the kid especially. How scared is she gonna be out there?
FRY: Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke Smoke screen for what?
JOHNS: Smoke screen for what?
FRY: For your own fear.
JOHNS: ( eyes narrowing )
FRY: How much you weigh, Johns?
JOHNS: What the hell's it matter?
FRY: How much?
JOHNS: 79 kilos.
FRY: Because you're 79 kilos of gutless white meat, and that's why you can't come up with a better plan.
RIDDICK: Think about that reward, Johns.
JOHNS: I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
RIDDICK: How 'bout a cut in your gut?
JOHNS: Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.
IMAM: Please.this solves nothing.please..
FRY: ( to Audrey )
IMAM: And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
FRY: No, I'm not. But
FRY: He lifts his goggles. RIDDICK'S POV: Checking the cabin. Finding a lot of wreckage but no life.
RIDDICK: Looks clear.
JOHNS: Said "looks clear."
RIDDICK: Said "looks clear."
JOHNS: Well, what's it look like now?
RIDDICK: ( rechecking )
FRY: Just get the goddamn lights on..
FRY: Ready, Johns.
JOHNS: He'll lead you over the first cliff. You know that, don't you?
FRY: We're just burnin' light here.
JOHNS: You give him the cells and the ship and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
FRY: I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing? Huh? Is there anything at all? Besides your next hype? Got no right to be so scared. Neither one of us.
FRY: ( to all )
RIDDICK: ( to Fry )
FRY: Riddick.was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal. Just in case, you know, this actually
RIDDICK: ( shaking head )
FRY: But I just wanted to say
RIDDICK: Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose. I fuckin' knew better.
FRY: We can, can't we? Trust you?
RIDDICK: ( completely genuine )
JOHNS: So you noticed too?
FRY: The procession grinds to a halt. Everyone sucks hard on breathers as they muster inside the light.
FRY: Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them?
RIDDICK: Saw something I didn't like.
JOHNS: Such as.
RIDDICK: Hard to tell, sometimes.even for me. but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought we'd swing wide. Okay by you?
FRY: Let's move. Just a detour. He'll get us there.
PARIS: Can we switch?
FRY: What, switch what?
PARIS: I think I twisted my ankle running backwards like that. And I'm not sure I Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to be alone back there anymore. If you could just give me a few minutes up front here
JOHNS: She's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells.
PARIS: Oh, so I'm disposable?
FRY: I'll switch, I'll switch! Christ, just get this train moving!
PARIS: Light, please, need light here..
IMAM: ( trembling )
PARIS: Oh, sweet Jesus..
PARIS: Oh, sweet Jesus, WILL YOU GET ME SOME
FRY: What do you see? Riddick?
RIDDICK: Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.
FRY: Four fulls, one half. That mean we're halfway there? I hope?
AUDREY: Four fulls, one half. That mean we're halfway there? I hope?
FRY: Can we pick up the pace?
JOHNS: We aren't completely stupid.
FRY: Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in the fucking
IMAM: We crossed our own tracks.
JOHNS: He's running us 'round in circles. Look for yourself. Look!
FRY: Riddick? What the hell are you
RIDDICK: Imagine a hundred Geiger-counters next to a truckload of plutonium. That's the SOUND that rides the wind now.
RIDDICK: Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some time to think.
FRY: Think about what?
JOHNS: About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!
RIDDICK: ( answering Fry )
FRY: What about her?
RIDDICK: What it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. With her bleeding.
JOHNS: What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not No. She's not.
RIDDICK: ( agreeing )
AUDREY: ( confessing )
FRY: No, we'd never..Oh, God, honey, you shoulda told me sooner.
JOHNS: ( finally getting it )
RIDDICK: They been nose-open for her ever since we left. They go off blood.
IMAM: Well.we must keep her close, then. Here, she'll be safe if we put her There is no "safe."
RIDDICK: ( scanning )
FRY: It's not gonna work. We gotta go back.
JOHNS: turned me into a goddamn sled dog. An' now you 'spect me to go back like a whipped dog?
FRY: I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now let's just go back to the ship.
JOHNS: I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out Are you fucking high again? Just listen No, no, you're right, Fry. What's to be afraid of? My life is a steamin' pile of meaningless toadshit anyhow. So I say mush on! Canyon's only couple hundred meters, after that we're in Skiff City! So why don't you just butch up, stuff a cork in that kid, and get
FRY: Are you fucking high again? Just listen No, no, you're right, Fry. What's to be afraid of? My life is a steamin' pile of meaningless toadshit anyhow. So I say mush on! Canyon's only couple hundred meters, after that we're in Skiff City! So why don't you just butch up, stuff a cork in that kid, and get

IMAM: She's the captain, we should listen to
JOHNS: Listen to her? to sacrifice us all?
AUDREY: What's he talkin' about?
JOHNS: During the crash, she
FRY: ( a warning growl )
JOHNS: she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us
FRY: Just shut up, okay?
JOHNS: tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right we are disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.
FRY: Would you RAG YOUR STUPID HOLE!
JOHNS: We're not alive because of her we're alive in spite of her.
FRY: We cannot go through there..
JOHNS: ( lording )
IMAM: ( pushing him back )
JOHNS: ( to all )
JOHNS: Ain't all of us gonna make it.
RIDDICK: Just realized that, huh?
JOHNS: Six of us left. If we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing, Not if I'm the one.
RIDDICK: Not if I'm the one.
JOHNS: What if you're one of five?
AUDREY: What're they doin' up there?
IMAM: Talking about the canyon, I suppose. How to get us through.
JOHNS: Look, it's hellified stuff but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called "triage," okay?
RIDDICK: Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
JOHNS: Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
RIDDICK: ( doping it out )
JOHNS: sled. We can drag the body behind us.
RIDDICK: Nice embellishment.
JOHNS: Don't wanna feed these land-sharks just keep 'em off our scent.
RIDDICK: ( looking back )
JOHNS: Don' look, don' look, don' look..
FRY: Imam. Slow down.
IMAM: Don't stop, just slow down. Little more space 'tween us and them.
FRY: Don't stop, just slow down. Little more space 'tween us and them.
IMAM: I would rather we all stay
FRY: Do what I say. Please.
RIDDICK: What's her name, anyway?
JOHNS: What do you care?
JOHNS: Then let's not name the Thanksgiving turkey, okay? I assume you still got a What, you 'spect
RIDDICK: What, you 'spect
JOHNS: What's one more to you? Like one that sends you to Hell?
RIDDICK: Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere. Or forget the museum maybe they should just hang you.
JOHNS: Awright. You do the girl, I'll keep the others off your back.
RIDDICK: ( shakes head )
JOHNS: Like who, Mr. Chrislam?
FRY: Bring the light!
AUDREY: What're they doing? What're
FRY: Leave the sled, let's go, go, go!
RIDDICK: Gotta stay in the light, Johns. That's the only rule.
RIDDICK: Remember that moment?
RIDDICK: Shoulda never took the chains off, Johns. You were one brave fuck, before. Now look at you. Oh, yeah, you were Billy Bad-ass with your gauge.with your chains..
RIDDICK: Back to the ship, huh?
FRY: Get out of our way.
RIDDICK: So everybody huddles together till the lights burn out? Until you can't see what's eating you? That the big plan?
IMAM: Where's Mr. Johns?
RIDDICK: Which half?
IMAM: You mean..
AUDREY: Gonna lose everybody out here..
RIDDICK: He died fast. And if we got any choice, that's the way we should all go out. Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare.
FRY: How many you see?
RIDDICK: One or two.
FRY: Three full bottles. But almost time to Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on, does it?
AUDREY: Three full bottles. But almost time to Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on, does it?
FRY: Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on, does it?
RIDDICK: Only see one way. Turn the sled over and drag it like that, girl down low. Light up everything we got and run through like dogs on fire.
IMAM: ( understanding )
FRY: And what about the cells?
RIDDICK: I'll take those.
FRY: We're just here to carry your light, aren't we? Just the torch-bearers.
RIDDICK: Let's drop back an' boot up.
RIDDICK: What're you doin'?
IMAM: Blessing you like the others. It's painless.
RIDDICK: And pointless.
IMAM: ( a beat )
RIDDICK: Riddick shrugs into the harness, snugs it down.
IMAM: He will be with us. Nonetheless.
RIDDICK: Give my blessing to the girl. She needs a spare.
RIDDICK: As fast as you can.
FRY: You sure you can keep
RIDDICK: As fast as you can.
RIDDICK: Don't look.
RIDDICK: More spattering. Fry looks up and stumbles when she beholds. A ceiling of predators. At the cusp of light, they dive and weave and dart, slashing each other in a rabid desire to SOUND OUT the humans below. It's like looking into a bucket of angry His voice whips them like the Devil's coxswain. Chastened, Fry keeps her eyes down and speed up. More blue blood showers down followed by entrails dropping out of the sky. Could this be Hell itself?
RIDDICK: Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going!
IMAM: ( a muttered mantra ) I cannot see, God leadeth me. all is dim, hard on him.."
FRY: Riddick? RIDDICK?
AUDREY: What? What is it?
RIDDICK: It's a fucking staircase! Go over it!
FRY: Audrey shakes out of it and scrambles for the shield just as. A predator kamikazes onto the shield, its bone-blades piercing the metal. And nearly skewering Audrey beneath. Caught in torchlight, steaming, the PREDATOR HOWLS as it tries to rip free of the shield. Beneath, Audrey hangs on and takes a thrashing. The predator tears clear, spins, pounces blindly at. Riddick, standing at light's edge. Stunningly, he catches the beast under its scythe blades, blunting the attack. The predator CLICKS MADLY at him. PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick's face. The predator rears back its head, ready to bisect Riddick with its skull-blade. Switchblade fast, Riddick drops a hand. .yanks his shiv. .and sweeps it over the belly of the beast. HOWLING, the predator falls, disemboweled. REACTION SHOTS of Fry and Imam. Stunned.
RIDDICK: Didn't know who he was fuckin' with.
IMAM: Get the girl back under. Keep going.
RIDDICK: Get the girl back under. Keep going.
IMAM: KEEP GOING OR I WILL!
SULEIMAN!: KEEP GOING OR I WILL!
RIDDICK: KEEP GOING OR I WILL!
FRY: Oh, no. No, no, no..
IMAM: EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT RAIN MONTAGE: Water rilling, running, flowing over rocks and EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT Caught in a downpour, the survivors slog to a stop. One torch goes out and won't relight.
RIDDICK: So where the hell's God now, huh? I'll tell you where! He's up there
FRY: Riddick? How close?
FRY: Tell me the settlement is right there!
RIDDICK, PLEASE!: We can't make it.
RIDDICK: We can't make it.
RIDDICK: Here.hide here..
RIDDICK: EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT They crawl into the fissure. The second torch dies behind them.
AUDREY: ( a beat )
AUDREY: He's not coming back, is he?
FRY: There's light in here.
FRY: What are they?
IMAM: Glow worms..
AUDREY: Glow worms..
FRY: ( mind racing )
AUDREY: More, more, we need more..
RIDDICK: Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
FRY: You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.
RIDDICK: Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
FRY: What, you're afraid?
RIDDICK: Confusin' me with Johns now fear was his monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don't see.
FRY: trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
RIDDICK: Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.
FRY: Then wait for me. I'll go back myself. Just give me more light for them.
FRY: Just come with me!
RIDDICK: Got a better idea. Come with
FRY: You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
RIDDICK: 'Course I am but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.
FRY: No, you see, I to.I have to go and..
RIDDICK: Step aboard, Carolyn.
FRY: ( tortured )
RIDDICK: ( approaching, extending
FRY: Don't do this to me..
RIDDICK: Just give me your hand.
FRY: But they.they could still be..
RIDDICK: No one's gonna blame you. C'mon. Take my hand and save yourself, Carolyn.
FRY: I will not give up on them! I Will not leave anyone on this rock with those fucking things, even if it means
RIDDICK: You'd die for them?
FRY: I would try for them.
RIDDICK: You barely know them.
FRY: But I'm human. I know you view that as a weakness, but I'm sorry I do feel fear, theirs too. Goddamnit, Riddick yes. I would die for them.
AUDREY: ( big-eyed )
RIDDICK: Yeah, yeah we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this?
RIDDICK: Tighter, tighter..
RIDDICK: They pile up awkwardly. Fry listens hard. Only RAINFALL.
FRY: I don't hear
RIDDICK: ( on his breath )
RIDDICK: Get behind me.
RIDDICK: When I go, we go. Full-throttle.
RIDDICK: RIDDICK'S POV: The gap between predators widens into a passage. A gauntlet within a gauntlet. Riddick runs. Linked like paper dolls, the others follow blindly. RIDDICK'S POV: Of a predator turning to "stare" over its PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick bearing down fast. The survivors hit the water like lawn mowers on legs, crashing through, scattering water and predators alike, managing to The muddy rise. Audrey loses her grip on the others. And starts back-sliding. She CRIES OUT, turning the head of. Riddick. He catches Audrey as her legs hit the pool. He muscles her back up the rise and heaves her over the top, sending her slip-sliding down the other side.
RIDDICK: You know the way!
IMAM: He wants her to board the skiff. Fry gives it another beat, eyes sweeping the dark rain. And just when we think it's over for Riddick TERRIBLE SCREAMS are heard from both man and predator: There's a helluva fight going on out there. Close out there. Fry snatches the glow-worms off Imam's neck. And plunges into the darkness, homing in on the SOUNDS until. A blade flashes in her face. She ducks and spots. Riddick. Bloody, muddy, he's down on his knees, still trying to fight off the shadow-beasts that swirl and slash all around him. Around them both.
FRY: It's me, it's me, it's me!
FRY: C'mon, Riddick said I'd die for not you.
FRY: Just 10 steps.keep turning, keep turning.that's right.others're already 'board, waitin' for us right now.five steps.c'mon, almost there, Riddick. almost there.we're almost
RIDDICK: Not for me..
RIDDICK: Probably okay to talk to me now.
AUDREY: Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started. Where you goin'?
RIDDICK: Not sure. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing..
RIDDICK: Might interest you..
IMAM: New Mecca..
RIDDICK: Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
IMAM: It's more a place where souls are found, Mr. Riddick.
