MRS. STEPHENS: if I'd listened to it years ago, I might have kept my sight. I wouldn't have let a man operate I had no faith in. so I'm listening to it now. It says all this filming isn't healthy - and that you need help.
MRS. STEPHENS: . get it, Mark. get it quickly. and until you've got it. I don't want you and Helen to see each.

MRS. STEPHENS: I mean it, Mark. And if you don't listen to me. one of us will move from this house - which would be a pity, because we'd never find a cheaper.
MARK: You'll never have to move. because of me. I promise you.
MRS. STEPHENS: Good boy. The stairs are the difficult part.
MRS. STEPHENS: Far enough, Mark.
MARK: taking my picture?

JARVIS: Have you any suspicions, Chief It could be any of them.

PUBLICITY MAN: Speaking of peculiar people.
PUBLICITY MAN: We've a psychiatrist coming down today. Dr Rosen -
INSPECTOR: I know him.
PUBLICITY MAN: It's pure publicity - and I promise he won't do any work.
INSPECTOR: What will he do?

INSPECTOR: The Publicity Man sighs with relief.

BADEN: Inspector, have you convinced yourself he's a member of my unit?
INSPECTOR: No, sir . but a few things seem to point to it. No one outside your unit admits to knowing the girl. There was a trunk all ready for her. and with the risks he was running, I think he'd have to use surroundings he was familiar with. Where is your unit now?
BADEN: Waiting for me on the set.
INSPECTOR: I'd like to watch them at their jobs, sir. It may tell me more than a hundred interviews.
BADEN: But, Inspector, the strain on them is already.

DOCTOR: The cure? Very quick. A couple of years analysis - three times a week - an hour a time - and it's soon up-rooted.
DOCTOR: . if you've any of his papers on the subject?
MARK: Yes, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I'd like to see them - I'll give you my address, young man.
SERGEANT: Wonder what all that's about?
INSPECTOR: We'll find out afterwards. Now, listen. I want you to watch who brings their own lunches. Someone ate homemade cakes and sandwiches by the side of those bushes - and we may get a lead.
SERGEANT: Right, sir.

DOCTOR: What makes people into Peeping Toms, one of his father's subjects, Peeping Toms.
INSPECTOR: ( slowly ) Peeping Toms.
DOCTOR: An interesting boy. he has his father's eyes. you don't suspect him, do you?
INSPECTOR: I suspect 'em all - what about I'm interested in that chap with the bald head and hatchet face. there's something on his mind!
DOCTOR: I'm interested in that chap with the bald head and hatchet face. there's something on his mind!
