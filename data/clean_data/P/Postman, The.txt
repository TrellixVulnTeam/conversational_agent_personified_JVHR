MAN'S FOOTPRINTS: These tracks may already be days old as they fill with rain water. Then, the sound of light, padded FOOTFALLS. A LION ENTERS FRAME. Lean, hungry and dangerous, the big cat has been tracking this man. He lets out a low, disappointed GROWL. The rain has foiled his dinner plans for now.
THE POSTMAN: I don't know. And if you ask me again, I'm going to slug you.
THE POSTMAN: It's been fun, hasn't it, kids? You're welcome!
THE POSTMAN: Damnit, Bill, you know I need to check it first!

THE POSTMAN: We interrupt our regularly scheduled program to bring you the Second Civil War. Well, shit. I don't want any trouble. I bet you don't either. Let's just call it a draw, okay?

THE POSTMAN: I'm rich.
THE POSTMAN: I'm just passing through. I don't mean anyone any harm. Water's good.
THE POSTMAN: I'm not a Holnist.
THE POSTMAN: They just stare at him, none saying a word. Creepy.
THE POSTMAN: I'm headed for a town called St. Rose. Somewhere west of Portland.
LEAD BANDIT: Portland's under twenty feet of Well, I heard different.

LEAD BANDIT: Don't be in such a rush, Martin. Now I see a pack mule over there, but I don't see no packs.
THE POSTMAN: This is all I got.
LEAD BANDIT: Oh. Kill him, Martin.
THE POSTMAN: ( pointing ) Okay! My stuff's up there!
BANDIT #20: What do you got in there?
LEAD BANDIT: Shut up. What do you got in there?
THE POSTMAN: Dried peas. Beef jerky. Sure. There's the ladder.
THE POSTMAN: Sure. There's the ladder.
BANDIT #20: Maybe he's got it booby-trapped.
LEAD BANDIT: You go up and get it.
BANDITS: There's no answer. The Bandits eye each other nervously.
BANDIT #20: Maybe he fell asleep.
76 BALL: The Postman grabs the wrench, starts working one of the last two rusted bolts. As it starts to give.
THE POSTMAN: It's going to take a second. I got my stuff bolted in.
BANDITS: The Lead Bandit takes a cautious step back.
LEAD BANDIT: Put some buckshot through it, Martin. Just to hurry him up.
HULKING BANDIT: I only got three shells left.
LEAD BANDIT: So use his gun.
76 BALL: Cramped, The Postman's busy at the base of the ball, trying to unscrew the last remaining bolt. It won't The Hulking Bandit has only a few more rungs to go.
LADDER: The Hulking Bandit has only a few more rungs to go.
76 BALL: No good. Time's up. The Postman starts rocking the pole.
LADDER: The Hulking Bandit has reached the opening feels the rocking motion. Hangs on.
76 BALL: Knife in hand, the Hulking Bandit looks inside. At that instant, The Postman rocks the pole one more time. The rusty bolt is not enough to keep the ball's full weight in place. It pops. The ball is frozen for an instant before going with the pole's tilt.
LADDER: The 76 ball drops off the pole, rolling over the Hulking Bandit's back and down the ladder's incline. The other Bandits dive clear as the 76 ball hurtles past.
THE POSTMAN: whips head over heels as the ball speeds away.
FIELD: The 76 ball launches off a dirt berm, but soon comes to a stop as it slams into an old utility pole and bursts apart. Fighting the vertigo, The Postman staggers to his Bill bolts from the station as the Lead Bandit raises the RIFLE and FIRES at The Postman. Losing balance, The Postman lands on his butt just before a bullet splinters the utility pole above his head. Wobbly, he tries to gather his packs. The Bandits charge, quickly closing the ground, but Bill is there first. Holding as much as he can, The Postman heaves himself over Bill's back. As the mule gallops away, the Lead Bandit aims the rifle. He's got The Postman in his sights. He's about to fire when Bandit #20 stands up INTO the SHOT. He's got a fistful of cigarettes in each hand and he's laughing like a hyena!

THE POSTMAN: Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and the day after that. Out brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts his hour upon the stage and is heard no more. It's a tale told by a moron. Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. But blow, wind! Come wrack! At least we'll die with the harness off our back!
MRS. THOMPSON: The children have never heard Shakespeare before.
THE POSTMAN: ( grinning ) They still haven't.
THE POSTMAN: Thanks. You're very nice.
CURMUDGEON LARRY: I'm clapping because you stink.
THE POSTMAN: I don't think you understand how it works.
CURMUDGEON LARRY: When I was young, I tried to be an actor. I was awful. But now I won't die thinking I was the worst I'm glad I could help.
THE POSTMAN: I'm glad I could help.
MRS. THOMPSON: Larry, stop it. You were very good.

MRS. THOMPSON: It's okay. We give them food and supplies. All the towns do.

BETHLEHEM: I said, what are you doing?
MAYOR: It's just a game, General Bethlehem. Something they saw in a play. No harm in it.
BETHLEHEM: A play? Show me. It's all right, children, show me.
BRAVE BOY: Arm, arm yourselves! No running from the witches!
BETHLEHEM: ( surprised ) Shakespeare, is it? Well, I'm sorry I missed it.
MAYOR: You should know, sir, we haven't nearly stocked the game we thought we would.
BETHLEHEM: Really? But you had time for a
BETHLEHEM: I'm taking three conscripts from each town. They will have the honor of serving in the Holnist Army until such time as I see fit. Three men. You suppose you could do that?
IDAHO: All men between 15 and 50 and of suitable ethnic foundation are required to show themselves now.

IDAHO: Acceptable, Captain!

BETHLEHEM: Welcome, gentlemen, to your new life. You have been born again as soldiers in the army of the United Clans of Holn. The strong have been sapped by the whimpering propaganda of the weak. Men, strong men, have been denied their destiny. You men have been saved from that fate. Redemption is within your grasp.
BETHLEHEM: You. What did you do before you were given this opportunity?
GANGLY RECRUIT: I had a shovel. I digged holes.
BETHLEHEM: You digged holes. Well, now you're going to fill them. And you?
THE POSTMAN: Is there any question in anyone's mind that I was talking to you? Yes, you. You look like a dangerous man. Are you?

THE POSTMAN: ( gaining confidence ) 'Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this son of York.'
BETHLEHEM: You're pretty good. You're also a fighter. I see it in your eyes.
BETHLEHEM: Don't you agree? Come on, a man's got to speak his mind.
THE POSTMAN: I don't mean any disrespect, sir, but you'd be better off just letting me go. A fighter is about the last thing I am.
BETHLEHEM: Don't you think I should be the judge of that, soldier?
BETHLEHEM: Get up. I said, get up.
BETHLEHEM: Put up your fists.
THE POSTMAN: You'd win.
BETHLEHEM: Now fight.

THE POSTMAN: I tried to tell him.
WOODY: Say it again.
THE POSTMAN: Say what?
WOODY: The words you said in town. About the wind blowing. And the rest. Say it again.
THE POSTMAN: 'Blow, wind. Come wrack. At least we'll die with the harness off our back.'
WOODY: What's it mean?
THE POSTMAN: Live free or die.
IDAHO: All right, girls. We're gonna run. Twenty miles. With packs. You got three hours. Everybody makes it. Or nobody eats.
IDAHO: Eat up! You got meat tonight.
IDAHO: Why don't you tell Shakespeare what kind of meat that is.
COOK: Probably Bill and The Postman knows it. He stares in revulsion at the putrid meat ladled into his pail.
IDAHO: A godawful animal. The sterile offspring of a horse and a donkey. Can you imagine that?! There's no room in this new world for a bastard like that. Uh uh. Any man last in line ain't hungry enough. You show up last, you don't eat!
IDAHO: Uh uh. Any man last in line ain't hungry enough. You show up last, you don't eat!
BANDIT #20: I'll die before I'm last in line That's what they're hoping for.
THE POSTMAN: That's what they're hoping for.
BANDIT #20: Serious? This isn't bad. These were supposed to be the best years of my life.
THE POSTMAN: These were supposed to be the best years of my life.
BETHLEHEM: The laws of eight, gentlemen. That is the legacy handed down to us by Nathan Holn.
RECRUITS: God rest his soul!
THE POSTMAN: ( low ) May he burn in hell.
BETHLEHEM: These are the laws that we live by. The eight is our symbol. Each man will bear it with pride.
BETHLEHEM: Only then will you be part of the clan. Sit down, gentlemen.
BETHLEHEM: Law One. You will obey orders without question. I told you to sit.
SLOW RECRUIT: ( scared ) There weren't enough chairs.
BETHLEHEM: I didn't specify chairs. You could've sat down on the ground.
BETHLEHEM: You disobeyed a direct order. You broke Law One.
BETHLEHEM: Law Two. Punishment shall be
BETHLEHEM: Law Three: Mercy is for the weak. Four: Terror will defeat reason. Five: Your allegiance is to the clan. Six: Justice can be dictated. Law Seven. Any clansman may challenge for leadership of the clan. Does any man here wish to challenge me?

BETHLEHEM: Law Eight: There is only one penalty: Death.
SLOW RECRUIT: Please, I'm begging you.
THE POSTMAN: As the sword finds its mark. Bethlehem looks at him, but addresses all.
BETHLEHEM: You will get out of this army what you put into it. Work and you'll be fed. Fight and you'll be respected. Die and you'll be remembered. It's up to you.
IDAHO: You thinking of challenging for leadership of the clan?
THE POSTMAN: No, sir. I'm a follower not a You see Colonel Getty? Always following the General? He's the only man who ever challenged. Fight lasted six seconds, but the General didn't kill him. He cut off his tongue and he cut off his balls and old Getty's been following him like a dog ever
IDAHO: You see Colonel Getty? Always following the General? He's the only man who ever challenged. Fight lasted six seconds, but the General didn't kill him. He cut off his tongue and he cut off his balls and old Getty's been following him like a dog ever
IDAHO: The General don't see it, but I say you got some nigger in you.
IDAHO: The General would like a word with you, Shakespeare.
BETHLEHEM: ( re: the book and They're yours. A solitary man, aren't you? Binoculars. To watch life from a distance. And Shakespeare. To read about it instead of living it.
THE POSTMAN: No offense, General, but you seem to have read some Shakespeare If he wishes to rise above mere thuggery, a military commandeer must be classically educated. Philosophy, history. Even a sense of the dramatic. Do you know what I did before the war? Do you think I was in the army? I sold copying machines. I was a salesman. The talent to lead men and devise and execute a battle plan were locked away inside me.

BETHLEHEM: If Nathan Holn hadn't come along, I'd still be selling copying machines. Can you imagine the wasted life? Can you imagine the magnitude of it? But war. War gives men like me a chance.
BETHLEHEM: Here. 'The prize is often left unclaimed. Have the courage to grasp it. For fortune always favors the bold.' It always inspires me. I have a design for the future. A master plan. I'll need able officers to carry it out. You have the intelligence. If your heart matches, you'll go far. We'll talk more in the weeks to come. Dismissed.
BETHLEHEM: Issue the binoculars to a scout.
IDAHO: And the book, sir?
BETHLEHEM: Burn it.
BETHLEHEM: Quit moving.
BANDIT #20: What happened? What did he say?
BANDIT #20: What did he say?
THE POSTMAN: BANDIT #20
BANDIT #20: Did he say anything about me?
THE POSTMAN: They reach the quiet corner; it's just the three of them.
THE POSTMAN: We got to get out of here.
BANDIT #20: What are you talking about?
THE POSTMAN: ( low ) You ever hear of St. Rose? It's on the coast. They say it's a paradise. They've even got electric lights.
BANDIT #20: We can't.
THE POSTMAN: Between the three of us, we No, no. I can't. I like it here. I like being a part of something.
BANDIT #20: No, no. I can't. I like it here. I like being a part of something.
IDAHO: One of you dogs has earned himself a treat. Over there.
IDAHO: Those men hunted themselves a lion this morning. Must've been a zoo around here before the war. Anyhow, they shot him and he crawled into that thicket. A third man went in after him. We don't know if he's dead or alive. I need a volunteer. Someone's gotta go in and get our boy out.
BANDIT #20: I'll go.
IDAHO: I guess size ain't a measure of courage, is it? Shakespeare!
BETHLEHEM: Come out alive and you got yourself a lion steak.
IDAHO: ( winks ) Maybe you'll find your St. Rose up
IDAHO: What are you waiting for,
THE POSTMAN: I found him.
THE POSTMAN: SOLDIER ( O.S. )
ARMY: Everyone stares across the river, straining to see as The Postman emerges with the corpse on his back.
ON BRIDGE: The Postman starts across, hampered by his burden. He pauses, at his feet, the cracked, knotty plank.
IDAHO: ( across river ) Hurry up! You still got a lion to
BETHLEHEM: In the water. Come back without him and you and another man will die in his place. Go! Go!
CONSCRIPTS: Go! Go!
BANDIT #20: ( caught up ) I'll get him, sir.

WOODY: It's you or me.
THE POSTMAN: I know.
IDAHO: Finish it.
WOODY: No harness on my back.
IDAHO: Tracking. He sees a dribble of fresh blood. He touches it with his fingers and smiles. He cocks his head at MOVEMENT to his left. Smiling, hefting his pistol, Idaho moves in. More SHUFFLING. Just ahead. He's got him now.
IDAHO: You want your St. Rose?
JEEP: Pulling the glass back down, he looks almost shyly at the skeleton, like two kids about to "park" for the first The back of the Jeep is filled with bags marked U.S. Mail. The Postman picks up a hat off the console. Oddly respectful, he runs a finger along the band over the "Horse & Rider" emblem. The Postman reaches, touches the embroidered American flag patch on the skeleton's jacket shoulder. Another shiver. A moment later, The Postman is pulling the nice dry jacket off the skeleton and shoving his own arms inside. A sloshing sound. He pats down the jacket. Finds a liquor. He gives the skeleton a "you shouldn't have" look. But the cap won't budge. He twists, pries, bangs the neck of the steering wheel. At last it gives. He takes a long, hard swallow. The warming fire streams down his throat. The Postman grabs a random letter, reads it aloud.
THE POSTMAN: Hey. How ya doin'?
THE POSTMAN: 'Jerry Ball, Pine View.'
THE POSTMAN: So, arrest me. Here's a piece of good news. Jerry's decided to go to school to get his contractor's license.
THE POSTMAN: ( smiles to skeleton ) Little Jimmy wants his grandpa to know he lost a tooth.
THE POSTMAN: Thanks for being there for me. Here's to you. I consider my taxes very well spent.
THE POSTMAN: All dressed up. Nowhere to go.

FORD: I want you to know I'd die to get a letter through.
FORD: I'll see you around.
THE POSTMAN: Sure thing, Ford.
BRISCOE: Johnny's real impressed with you. Whole town's real impressed with I take it you're not.
THE POSTMAN: I take it you're not.
BRISCOE: Smarter than you look.
THE POSTMAN: What can I do for you, Sheriff?
BRISCOE: You can clear out. Or I can throw you out. Either way suits me I'm afraid you don't understand, Sheriff. I'm a government employee. Authorized by
THE POSTMAN: I'm afraid you don't understand, Sheriff. I'm a government employee. Authorized by
BRISCOE: You're not authorized by shit. You're nothing but a drifter who found a bag of mail. And I want you out of my town.
THE POSTMAN: This is going in my report.
BRISCOE: These people don't need dreams, Mr. Postman. They need something real. They need help with the goddamn Holnists. Are you going to bring them that? Didn't think so. All you cost us so far is a few bowls of soup and maybe later a few broken hearts. I aim to keep it that way. You can stay till morning. Then I don't ever want to see you again.
ON FORD: Concentrating, Ford holds a needle and thread and a piece of cloth on which he's drawn an approximation of the post office shoulder patch. By moonlight he embroiders it in. Not exactly work you'd pay money for, but not bad either.
THE POSTMAN: Just leave it.
THE POSTMAN: I said leave it.
THE POSTMAN: Hello, Abby.
ABBY: You'll be leaving tomorrow?
THE POSTMAN: I guess.
ABBY: ( enters; closes door ) Everybody's up late writing letters for you to take. We're not supposed to waste candles like that, but they're so excited.
THE POSTMAN: How about you? Do you have a I don't have anybody to write to.
ABBY: I don't have anybody to write to.
THE POSTMAN: I'll find you a pen pal. Someone with interests similar to your own. Dancing, checking for mumps.
ABBY: You're funny. Hardly anyone's funny around here.
THE POSTMAN: I guess no one feels much like
ABBY: Have you decided yet?
THE POSTMAN: Oh, well, I've been thinking about
THE POSTMAN: Sure. Why not?
THE POSTMAN: God, you're beautiful. Sorry, I know you'd probably like to keep things more clinical. You don't even know my name.
ABBY: I don't want to.
ABBY: It would be easier for me if you closed your eyes.
THE POSTMAN: What about those?
FORD: These are going to Blue Jay. About twenty miles east. I thought I could take them.
THE POSTMAN: ( absently ) Okay. They're yours.
BRISCOE: I'm your escort out of town.
CITIZEN #1: We took a vote, Mr. Postman. We want you to have this horse.
CITIZEN #2: Now don't say no. A man on horseback can cover ten times the territory of a man on foot.
THE POSTMAN: ( smiles at Briscoe ) I'll take it.
CITIZEN #3: There's a bedroll, some oats and a week's rations.
THE POSTMAN: Thank you.
CITIZEN #1: Where do you figure you'll go from Go?. Oh yeah. I'll head west, then work my way back here in a sort of figure eight.
THE POSTMAN: Go?. Oh yeah. I'll head west, then work my way back here in a sort of figure eight.
THE POSTMAN: Times seem hard right now. But you have to believe it's getting better. Birds are migrating again. The rains are back.
BRISCOE: You got a helluva nerve, whoever you are.
THE POSTMAN: Is Abby around?
BRISCOE: She and Michael are working the north meadow this morning.
BRISCOE: Well, you're on your own.
BRISCOE: Hey! Are you really who you say you are?
THE POSTMAN: If I come back with some mail, you'll know!
BRISCOE: God damn it!
THE POSTMAN: Eugene. Benning. Portland. Seattle. Boise. St. Rose, Paradise on the Pacific.
THE POSTMAN: Maybe one thing can still be All in all, not a bad gig, huh?
ABBY: What are you looking at?
MICHAEL: He steps over and they're in each other's arms. This is love. But as Michael kisses her, we hear a familiar
SENTRY: Holnists! Holnists are coming!
BETHLEHEM: They don't usually look at me.
BETHLEHEM: Who's responsible for that?!
BRISCOE: Holnists, Johnny. You gotta stay out of sight.
FORD: I'm a postman. And I'm not hiding from anyone. I You stay out of this, or I'll lock you up myself damnit.
BRISCOE: You stay out of this, or I'll lock you up myself damnit.
BETHLEHEM: You. You'll be responsible. Get him a torch.
BETHLEHEM: Set that flag on fire.
ON MICHAEL: It's killing him, but Michael sets the torch to the flag.
BETHLEHEM: Now throw it through the window of your 'post office.'
ON FORD: Struggling to get out, but Briscoe blocks his way.
ON BETHLEHEM: As flames grow, he takes one last look around.
BETHLEHEM: The United States doesn't exist. That flag is an abomination.
BRISCOE: General Bethlehem. We're gathering the tribute, sir. Can I take your wagons?
BETHLEHEM: Make sure that fire doesn't go
BETHLEHEM: Good Lord. That, gentlemen, is a first-rate piece of ass.
BETHLEHEM: Tell the Sheriff I want to be introduced. She does not belong in a mudhole like this.
MICHAEL: Excuse me.
BETHLEHEM: ( looks over ) You again?
MICHAEL: That's my wife, General. She's a married woman.
BETHLEHEM: Do you know what system of government we have here, son? A feudal system. Like the Middle Ages. With lords and vassals. That's you and me. Those lords, they had some ideas. If a vassal got married, it was the lord's right, his right, to sleep with the bride on the wedding night.
MICHAEL: Me and Abby have been married for three years.
BETHLEHEM: Sorry, but I wasn't invited to the wedding. Now, you've already done me one favor, son. Don't let this be a black mark on an otherwise perfect record.
ABBY: Another woman has pointed out to her what's going on. She can't hear what's being said, but she watches, concerned.
PARKING LOT: We'll be civilized about this. I want you to give me your blessing.
BETHLEHEM: We'll be civilized about this. I want you to give me your blessing.
MICHAEL: Sir, I can't. You can't.
BETHLEHEM: Can't? I'm tired of can't. We had a great nation once. Do you know what made it that way? I can! Till the weak came along. The 'I can'ts' destroyed us. But I'm going to make us strong again. I'm going to be the father of a new nation. Do you know why it will be me?
BETHLEHEM: Because I can!
ABBY: Abby rushes forward, but she's blocked by Getty and another man. She cries out again and again. Filled with impotent fury, Briscoe squeezes out the words.
BRISCOE: You didn't have to
BETHLEHEM: Didn't have to what, Sheriff?
BETHLEHEM: Your people seem seditious. You seem seditious. Aw, Michael.
BRISCOE: Aw, Michael.
BETHLEHEM: What am I seeing here? I'm Man came through here. With mail. Said he was a postman. Said the government had been restored back What government?
BRISCOE: ( burying his anger ) Man came through here. With mail. Said he was a postman. Said the government had been restored back What government?
BETHLEHEM: What government?
FORD: The United States government.
BETHLEHEM: Who said that?
BETHLEHEM: Which way did he go? Do not make me ask again.
BRISCOE: ( lies ) ( to Getty ) Send a patrol east. Send three more south, north and west. ( to Briscoe ) They'd better find him east.
BETHLEHEM: ( to Getty ) Send a patrol east. Send three more south, north and west. ( to Briscoe ) They'd better find him east.
FORD: I managed to save these.
BRISCOE: ( re: shirt ) Take that thing off, Johnny. You want to die, too?
FORD: I'm headed south. With the mail.
BRISCOE: ( grabs harness ) Don't be a damn fool.
FORD: What kind should I be?. Haw!
THE POSTMAN: Rachel Clark! Charlie Sykes! Graham Druitt!
VOICE: G.D. died last winter of flu.
THE POSTMAN: That's it for now, folks. There'll be more once a real system is in place.
MAN: Tell us about President Starkey!
WOMAN: What about New York City? Did they survive the plague?
THE POSTMAN: Survive? They got Broadway up and running again. There's a kid doing Andrew Lloyd Webber like you wouldn't believe. How much is it to mail a letter?
MAN #3: How much is it to mail a letter?
THE POSTMAN: ( smiles ) A buck seventy-five.
MAN #3: That sounds awful cheap.
THE POSTMAN: The catch is the only currency recognized are silver American coins minted before 1964 and two dollar bills. Look for Thomas Jefferson. Of course, food is always acceptable as barter.
GIBBS: ( rides up; salutes ) They won't open the gates, sir.
BETHLEHEM: They say they got a representative of the restored United States in there. They say this army is illegal. They say
GIBBS: They say they got a representative of the restored United States in there. They say this army is illegal. They say
CHUBBY SENTRY: Drop dead and go to hell!
BETHLEHEM: The Romans had an expression they used to scare their children. 'Hannibal ad portas!' Hannibal is at the gates. Do you know who Hannibal was? Of course not. A pretty girl like you wouldn't know a thing. Colonel Getty, get some men up there and open that gate.
MAYOR: What the hell are you doing?! Open the gates!
SKINNY SENTRY: Government's restored! We don't have to take their crap anymore!
MAYOR: CITIZEN #1 ( realizing; scared )
CITIZEN #1: ( realizing; scared ) They're gonna kill us all.
CHUBBY SENTRY: No! Let's fight them!
MAYOR: With what? We got five guns maybe 20 rounds of ammo in the whole town! How do we fight them with
THE POSTMAN: You don't. Negotiate a settlement. Give them extra
MAYOR: Okay. You're a government rep. You go tell them.
BETHLEHEM: Make it quick. I've got an attack to coordinate.
THE POSTMAN: General, um, they've asked me to negotiate a peace treaty.
BETHLEHEM: Do I know you?
THE POSTMAN: I don't think so, sir. I
BETHLEHEM: ( scans uniform ) You're the Postman, aren't you?
ABBY: watches from the flap of Bethlehem's tent. The guard sees and shoves her back inside.
BETHLEHEM: The restored United States. Do these people really believe that shit? Who are you really?
THE POSTMAN: I am a United States Postman. Authorized by order 417 of the restored Congress to
BETHLEHEM: I was at the Battle of Georgetown. I watched the White House burn to the ground. Don't try to sell me on any restored U.S.
THE POSTMAN: The new capital is based in Minneapolis. Inside the Hubert Humphrey Metrodome. You know, where the Vikings used to play?
BETHLEHEM: You're funny. Now, what are the They'll open the gate and give you double what they usually give. Just don't hurt anybody. This was all a misunderstanding.
THE POSTMAN: They'll open the gate and give you double what they usually give. Just don't hurt anybody. This was all a misunderstanding.
BETHLEHEM: Appreciate your offer, Postman. Problem is, you're in no position to negotiate. These people made it through the bugs and the riots and the three year winter. But they're not going to survive you.
BETHLEHEM: Law six, justice can be dictated. Kill him. And kill the restored United States with him.
CAPTAIN: ( by rote ) In accordance with law eight and by the authority of Emergency Order 46, you are hereby
BETHLEHEM: Get her.
BETHLEHEM: Colonel Getty!
ABBY: We can't stop now. They'll be coming after us.
THE POSTMAN: ( disoriented )
ABBY: Don't move.
SIXTH SOLDIER: If you'd had a bullet, you'd a used it by now.
ABBY: You're right.
THE POSTMAN: Thank you.
THE POSTMAN: I don't think I ever had water soup before. Maybe next time we could try it with a little sand? Dirt? Wood? A twig garnish?
THE POSTMAN: You used to think I was funny.
ABBY: They killed Michael.
THE POSTMAN: I'm sorry.
ABBY: How sorry are you?
THE POSTMAN: What's that supposed to mean? What's with you?
THE POSTMAN: What's with you?
ABBY: You got the mark of eight on you.
THE POSTMAN: A mark doesn't mean I'm a
ABBY: You're a liar. I should've let you die.
THE POSTMAN: Then, why didn't you?
THE POSTMAN: You were with Bethlehem. Does that make you one of them?
THE POSTMAN: ( re: the spoon ) Don't make me use this.
THE POSTMAN: Wind's come up. Getting colder too. Must be another storm
ABBY: Anything else?
THE POSTMAN: I didn't mean for you to
ABBY: Your legs are going to rot off if you don't try to walk.
THE POSTMAN: I'm hurt.
ABBY: You're lazy.
THE POSTMAN: Lazy?! I got a hole in my stomach. I'm weak. The two big meals around here are grass and snow. And we're running out of
THE POSTMAN: Where are you going?
THE POSTMAN: You're not leaving me here, are
ABBY: This is the last of it.
THE POSTMAN: ( mumbled ) Give me a break.
ABBY: I'm going to check the pass.
THE POSTMAN: Why are you in such a hurry to get out of here? I can think of worse places. And worse company to
THE POSTMAN: You can't play tic-tac-toe with
ABBY: 82 INT. HUNTING SHACK - DAY 82
THE POSTMAN: I can't help you.
ABBY: I told you that's all there was.
THE POSTMAN: That's why you should have it.
ABBY: I knew you could walk.
THE POSTMAN: You're weird, you know that?
THE POSTMAN: We walked on the moon once, Abby.
ABBY: So? What good is that now?
THE POSTMAN: Obviously you've forgotten Tang and microwave ovens. Your face looks pretty.
THE POSTMAN: Not so bruised.
ABBY: Look, there's something you'd better know. You're going to find out soon enough. I'm pregnant. It's Michael's baby. You're just the body father.
THE POSTMAN: How do you know it's mine and not He tried with me almost every night. He couldn't do it. So he beat me. Said it was my fault.
ABBY: He tried with me almost every night. He couldn't do it. So he beat me. Said it was my fault.
HANDS: plunge into the water, pull splashfuls up. We START ON The Postman's back, then ARC AROUND as he washes his face. He's just finished shaving off his beard with the hunting knife. He's nicked-up, but it's a definite improvement and he smiles in satisfaction until he sees Abby, reflected in the water.
THE POSTMAN: The Postman whips around to see her standing there.
THE POSTMAN: What is it? What's wrong? Is it the baby?
ABBY: The pass is clear. It's time to
THE POSTMAN: What happened?
THE POSTMAN: You got our stuff out.
ABBY: Of course.
THE POSTMAN: Of course? I don't understand.
ABBY: I set the fire.
THE POSTMAN: Am I missing the point here?
ABBY: You didn't think we'd stay here forever, did you? I'd appreciate if you'd walk with me long enough to find someplace safe for the baby. Then we can split up. You shaved.
THE POSTMAN: It looks nice.
ABBY: It looks nice.
THE POSTMAN: You're really weird, you know
THE POSTMAN: Have you ever heard of St. Rose, I've heard people talk. I've heard lots of names. Bliss. Hesperia. New Eden. Sheriff Briscoe says it's a fantasy.
ABBY: I've heard people talk. I've heard lots of names. Bliss. Hesperia. New Eden. Sheriff Briscoe says it's a fantasy.
THE POSTMAN: He's wrong. St. Rose is out there. And I'm going to find it.
ABBY: But you're The Postman.
THE POSTMAN: Look, I'm nobody, Abby. I'm
THE POSTMAN: This is what I hate. Strangers. Do you say 'hi' or do you blow their head off? Do they want to share what they got or take what you have? And if they want to take, how far are you willing to go to stop them? Damn it. All right. That's far enough. We don't want any trouble.
THE POSTMAN: We don't want any trouble.
RIDER: Me neither, mister. What are you?
ABBY: What are you?
THE POSTMAN: That's impossible.
PONYTAIL: Ain't you heard of The Postman?
ABBY: No, tell us.
PONYTAIL: He's only the greatest man who ever lived. He crossed the wasteland, shook his fist at the enemy and spit in the eye of General Bethlehem himself. He's back east with President Starkey right now.
THE POSTMAN: Who told you all this?
PONYTAIL: Postmaster Ford Lincoln Mercury. He's in direct contact with the restored congress.
THE POSTMAN: Direct contact. I don't believe Do you have mail, or don't you?
PONYTAIL: ( growing irritated ) Do you have mail, or don't you?
THE POSTMAN: You said Carrier Eighteen. That mean there's eighteen of you?
PONYTAIL: Thirty-two. As of midnight.
CHUBBY: You got another letter?
FORD: More recruits?
RED: Seven of them. They're coming from everywhere.
CHUBBY: Did you get a letter or didn't
FORD: Gather 'round, everybody. Got another letter here. Came in last
THE POSTMAN: What's all this?
YOUNG CARRIER: Postman sent Ford another letter. He's gonna read it.
FORD: ( reading ) 'Hello, all postal carriers.'
CARRIERS: ( a ritual ) I'm here in Minneapolis with President Starkey, but my thoughts are with you. Remember, nothing worth doing can be done overnight. Keep your chins up and do your best not to get shot. Signed, The
FORD: I'm here in Minneapolis with President Starkey, but my thoughts are with you. Remember, nothing worth doing can be done overnight. Keep your chins up and do your best not to get shot. Signed, The
PONYTAIL: His letters are always kind of
FORD: ( looks up ) Hold on now. There's a P.S. Anybody know what P.S. stands for?
CHUBBY: Holy shit.
RED: That would be H.S., Chubby.
CHUBBY: I seen him once when I lived in Benning. It's The Postman!
THE POSTMAN: P.S. Ford knows what to do.
FORD: Guess you want to talk about this? I found him! I found him!
PONYTAIL: I found him! I found him!
THE POSTMAN: President Starkey? Minneapolis? Ford knows what to do?
FORD: I thought you were dead.
THE POSTMAN: So? I'm not making the connection. What's all this then?
FORD: I lied. I told people you were in contact with me.
THE POSTMAN: Because I didn't want it to end.
FORD: Because I didn't want it to end.
THE POSTMAN: I don't know how long I can stay, Ford. President Starkey will send word one day and I'll have to move on. Understand?
FORD: Sure. But you'll stay till he sends word? Right?
THE POSTMAN: Aw, don't do that. Hands down.
FORD: You'll stay 'til President Starkey sends word, right? Right?
THE POSTMAN: Yeah, till he sends word, right.
FORD: Could you say a few words?
THE POSTMAN: Two plus two equals four.
FORD: We bring all the mail here first. We sort it, group it and then it goes out. So far we got thirty
THE POSTMAN: You spelled tyranny wrong.
CHUBBY: ( low, to Red ) Boy, he's smart.
THE POSTMAN: How old are you?
OLD GEORGE: Seventy-five, sir.
THE POSTMAN: Can you ride?
OLD GEORGE: Nope. Can't walk too good, Why are you here?
THE POSTMAN: Why are you here?
OLD GEORGE: I know stuff.
THE POSTMAN: ( re: tattoo ) When did you get that?
OLD GEORGE: 1970. A girl with eyes as big as saucers did me in a little town called Saigon.
THE POSTMAN: He's got her attention, just doesn't know what to do with
ABBY: He's got her attention, just doesn't know what to do with
THE POSTMAN: Ford wants me to have his trailer. Said it's the best one.
ABBY: I'm on the other side of town.
THE POSTMAN: I got plenty of room here.
THE POSTMAN: So much for the uniform theory.
BETHLEHEM: What do you think, Lieutenant?
GIBBS: Can't tell what it is if you stand too close. The colors all kinda run together, don't they?
BETHLEHEM: Bethlehem looks away from his painting to see Gibbs and Getty flanking a scared, blue-clad mail carrier. For an instant, mistakes him for:
BETHLEHEM: Well, if it isn't our old friend the U.P.S. man.
GIBBS: We captured him on the Oregon
BETHLEHEM: Who the hell are you?
BETHLEHEM: I want the camp struck at dawn. We're moving north.
GIBBS: Yes, sir.
BETHLEHEM: ( chilling ) You spelled tyranny wrong.
THE POSTMAN: I wish they'd stop saluting. Just stay safe and remember. The mailman's more important than the Boy, he's smart. What the hell?
THE POSTMAN: Just stay safe and remember. The mailman's more important than the Boy, he's smart. What the hell?
CHUBBY: Boy, he's smart. What the hell?
THE POSTMAN: What the hell?
THE POSTMAN: For President Starkey and the First Congress of the Restored United States, I officially declare Postal Station 10. What's the name of this town?
YOUNG LEADER: We never named it.
THE POSTMAN: ( thinks; smiles ) I officially declare Postal Station 10 in Elvis, Oregon, open for business!
LITTLE BOY: I missed him.
BRISCOE: Phil, this better not be another of your U.F.O.'s.
THE POSTMAN: I'm back! And I got mail.
BRISCOE: ( amazed ) I'll be damned.
FORD: Bethlehem is offering a 1000 pounds of gold to whoever brings you in. Dead or alive.
THE POSTMAN: Thank God it wasn't a carton of I'd have shot you myself.
BRISCOE: I'd have shot you myself.
BRISCOE: Things are getting better. Getting better all the time. I don't know who you are, but I do know I was wrong about you.
THE POSTMAN: Got a letter for you, Sheriff.
BRISCOE: It's from my sister. I thought she was dead.
THE POSTMAN: You thought wrong.
DANCE: The Postman taps Ford's shoulder, wants to cut in on him and Abby. Ford steps aside. A beat before Abby decides it's okay. They begin. Her eyes are on her feet, careful that she doesn't take a misstep. But his eyes are on her. And over it all, BLEEDING IN, the sound of HOOF BEATS.
DANCE: They whirl as the tempo picks up. The Postman pulls Abby in closer. Her eyes now move up to his.
ROAD: They're closing in on the terrified Red.
DANCE: Abby and The Postman. The chemistry is undeniable.
ROAD: RIFLES CRACK. SHOT in the back, Red throws back his arms. Letters flutter from the mail bag over his shoulder; he seems to glide along that way forever.
DANCE: The Postman looks at Abby; she's so beautiful. Like only a pregnant woman can be.
THE POSTMAN: Tell me about the baby, Abby. I want to know.
ROAD: Red falls from his horse. One of the soldiers scoops up his mailbag.
GIBBS: Births and deaths, the weather, gossip. There's nothing here.
BETHLEHEM: Nothing? Everything is here. Am I the only one who sees that? Get out!
BETHLEHEM: Give the people back their hope and their dreams won't be far
BETHLEHEM: What is it, Getty? A military man, especially a commander, should keep a journal. After he's gone, it's the only real defense against the slander that arises.
BETHLEHEM: ( crumpling the paper ) A military man, especially a commander, should keep a journal. After he's gone, it's the only real defense against the slander that arises.
THE POSTMAN: Who do you talk to?
OLD GEORGE: Not a soul in seven years of trying. But I will.
OLD GEORGE: Go ahead. Take a look. Want some?
THE POSTMAN: No. No thanks. Hey, don't let the kids see that.
OLD GEORGE: I was an aerospace engineer. I helped design the Galileo space I dream it's orbiting Earth forever. With a dozen human skeletons all grinning at each other. Laughing at us down here. What is it?
THE POSTMAN: What is it?
FORD: It's Red. He's overdue.
THE POSTMAN: That makes five. All on Southern No. No. Not him. No. Children. I want a man and you bring me children!
BETHLEHEM: No. No. Not him. No. Children. I want a man and you bring me children!
GIBBS: Not yet. General wants the message to get back.
THE POSTMAN: Tell me about the other stuff you
THE POSTMAN: Ford, I want you to get rid of the bodies. I don't want these people blamed for what we did.
SENTRY: Halt! Identify yourself!
WAGON: tearing along. Ford at the reins, urging the horses to all possible speed. Then he stands, leaps to the ground.
SENTRIES: They raise their rifles as the riderless wagon looms out of the night. They each get off a SHOT before being forced to dive out of the way. The wagon continues on, down to.
HOLNIST CAMP: A soldier finally grabs hold of one of the halters and brings the wagon to a stop. Half-dressed, Bethlehem steps up. A tarp covers the back upon which is written.
BETHLEHEM: ( reading ) Postage due.
BETHLEHEM: You want a war? I'll give you a war. I was born for it!
THE POSTMAN: riding his weary mount into town, saddlebags bulging with mail. He pauses by the new recruits long enough to hear the words they're saying. As he dismounts, a fresh-faced carrier takes the bridle. The Postman's well past the point of fatigue. He's living on pure adrenaline.
THE POSTMAN: Get this mail sorted. Bring me a fresh horse. Something to eat.
THE POSTMAN: And all the mail going South!
THE POSTMAN: They changed the oath.
ABBY: Ford's idea.
THE POSTMAN: ( scoffs ) They don't think to ask who they're replacing. Or why.
LUKE: Sir? It'd be an honor if I could shake your hand.
LUKE: THE POSTMAN
THE POSTMAN: You look like. Do I know you?
LUKE: No, sir.
THE POSTMAN: Well, good luck to you.
THE POSTMAN: Nice kid. Probably be dead in a You're exhausted. You need rest. There's food in the trailer
ABBY: ( ignores it ) You're exhausted. You need rest. There's food in the trailer
THE POSTMAN: Where are you going?
PONYTAIL: Route twenty-two. I'm already an hour late.
THE POSTMAN: You're grounded. Get off the horse. You know the rule.
PONYTAIL: What rule?
THE POSTMAN: Twenty-two's too far south.
PONYTAIL: But they're waiting on their mail down there.
THE POSTMAN: Get off the goddamn horse.
THE POSTMAN: ( re: Ponytail's Tie him off to this one.
ABBY: You can't keep doing this.
THE POSTMAN: Doing what?
ABBY: Riding all the routes. You're not saving anyone.
THE POSTMAN: Did I ever tell you how I got to be a postman, Abby? I don't know if you'd laugh or
NIGHT: A crowd of townsfolk are visible in deep b.g. Beyond them, the town of Elvis burns to the ground. The CAMERA CIRCLES AROUND the BLOODIED CARRIER until we're looking OVER his shoulder at a firing squad led by Colonel Getty and Lieutenant Gibbs. Bethlehem watches.
GIBBS: The only building not on fire is the post office. A SOLDIER rides up, carrying a torch, meaning to burn it.
SOLDIER: The post office, General?
BETHLEHEM: No. Let it stand. All by itself. So it can remind them what it cost
GIBBS: Rifles are aimed.
GIBBS: Shock and dismay from the townsfolk as SHOTS RING OUT.
BETHLEHEM: You think you can ride? Then today's your lucky day.
BLOODIED CARRIER: Bethlehem says.
BLOODIED CARRIER: . he's. headed north. He's gonna kill ten people in every town. Then burn it to the ground. For what you did.
BLOODIED CARRIER: He said to tell you Pine View's on his way. He said he'd wait there, but not for long. I was so scared, sir. I thought they were going to kill me, too. I wish they would have.
POSTMAN'S POV: Pine View in flames. The big John Deere gun has blown several gaps into the palisade. Bethlehem watches as his army sacks the town. The people have been rounded up. The selection of the ten has begun.
FORD: What are you going to do?
THE POSTMAN: I'm going to stop this.
FORD: You can't.
THE POSTMAN: Get out of my way, Ford. All of They'll kill you.
FORD: ( shaking his head ) They'll kill you.
THE POSTMAN: The Postman jumps off his horse. Ford tackles him. The Postman shoves him away, continues on. Luke and Chubby pounce on him. With Ford's help, they hold him down.
FORD: You can't help them!
THE POSTMAN: There's still time, Ford!
PONYTAIL: ( re: The Postman ) You're hurting him.
FORD: No, this is all my doing. I went against your orders.
FORD: The Holnists we killed. You told me to bury them. But I didn't. I sent Bethlehem the bodies.
THE POSTMAN: Because Bethlehem has to know that we're not going to stop.
FORD: Because Bethlehem has to know that we're not going to stop.
THE POSTMAN: God damn you, Ford. Those people down there are dying because of us. Because of what we did.
FORD: Bullshit. They're dying because of Bethlehem. They're dying because this is a shitty world. And if we're ever going to change it, then somebody might have to die. If I could make it be me down there I would. But I can't.
THE POSTMAN: My God, what have I done? We don't even know their names.
PONYTAIL: ( holding back We know their names. The little one's my brother. His name is
PONYTAIL: What Ford did was wrong. But it doesn't change anything for any of us. Does it?
BETHLEHEM: ( to Getty ) He's out there somewhere. Watching. I can feel it.
BETHLEHEM: You feel it too, don't you? Didn't have to end like this, Sheriff. He knew where I'd be if he wanted to face me like a man. Instead, he's hiding like a rabbit. So much for your Postman.
GIBBS: Ready! Aim!
BRISCOE: Ride, Postman! Ride! You hear me? I said ride!
BETHLEHEM: The RIFLES BARK. Everyone falls dead.
ABBY: Ford thinks you're going to do I am.
THE POSTMAN: I am.
THE POSTMAN: If I don't, those kids are going to keep on getting themselves Ford doesn't know what it means to be a kid. He doesn't have your memories. None of them do. All they've got is the lousy world we gave them. And this is the only decent thing in it.
ABBY: Ford doesn't know what it means to be a kid. He doesn't have your memories. None of them do. All they've got is the lousy world we gave them. And this is the only decent thing in it.
THE POSTMAN: What? Being a postman? It's all bullshit, Abby. All of it. I took this uniform off a skeleton to stay warm. I made up the rest to stay fed. There is no restored United States.
ABBY: I knew it was something like that.
THE POSTMAN: Weird thing is, being a Postman was almost the best thing that ever happened to me. Remember this? You left it behind that night.
ABBY: I remember.
THE POSTMAN: I always liked to think you left it on purpose. But maybe you just forgot it.
THE POSTMAN: Is this everybody?
FORD: The rest are on the overdue list.
THE POSTMAN: This is everybody. Got a letter from President
THE POSTMAN: 'Greetings all carriers.'
CARRIERS: Greetings, President Starkey!
THE POSTMAN: ( reading ) 'I've been in contact with The Postman. I've received all the reports. I'm proud of you all.' In dark days, in a weary world, you gave everything and asked for nothing. You beat back despair and replaced it with hope and for that your country can never repay you. But the price is too high. I won't see anymore of my bravest die. It is my duty to hereby disband the Postal Service of the restored United States. You are to burn your uniforms and The Postman is to return to Minneapolis at once. Thank you and that is all.

FORD: ( low; fierce ) The President never wrote that If he could've that's what he would have said.
THE POSTMAN: If he could've that's what he would have said.
FORD: Who's the other letter to?
THE POSTMAN: Bethlehem. I'm taking it to him in the morning.
FORD: What does it say?
THE POSTMAN: Mail's private. You know that.
FORD: What does it say?
THE POSTMAN: ( stops; turns ) It says it's over. It says we It says you quit. What about the Tell me something, Ford. How much mail can a dead postman deliver? It's over.
FORD: It says you quit. What about the Tell me something, Ford. How much mail can a dead postman deliver? It's over.
THE POSTMAN: Tell me something, Ford. How much mail can a dead postman deliver? It's over.
FORD: Then I'll take it.
THE POSTMAN: I can't trust you.
FORD: If this is the end. If this is the last piece of mail that ever gets delivered. I'll take it.
THE POSTMAN: Whoever takes this letter probably dies for it.
FORD: I'm still a postman. You owe it to me. I owe it to me.
THE POSTMAN: I'm going to St. Rose, Abby. And I'm taking you with me. I know you don't want to hear it, but that's my child inside you. I want to see it born somewhere safe. I have a right to that, Abby. Whether you like it or not.
THE POSTMAN: Thought I recognized you.
LUKE: General Bethlehem said. . You should be on your knees when I do it.
THE POSTMAN: I don't give a damn what that asshole said.
LUKE: The general is a great man.
THE POSTMAN: The general is a fucking lunatic.
THE POSTMAN: You don't own a thought in that goddamn head of yours, do you? You want to see a man?
THE POSTMAN: That's a man.
THE POSTMAN: You don't understand, do you? You never will until you can think for yourself and be willing to pay the price for it.
THE POSTMAN: You ready?
THE POSTMAN: You're a better man than Bethlehem, Luke. I've seen it.
CHUBBY: Guess Minneapolis is that way.
THE POSTMAN: We can't help you. We're just as lost as you are.
BETHLEHEM: Good lord, what do we have here?
FORD: I'm a representative of the restored United States
GIBBS: He's got a letter. Says The Postman sent it.
BETHLEHEM: A letter?
BETHLEHEM: 'Bethlehem. This letter is my testimony to the fact that there is no restored United States and there is no Postal Service.' Then who the hell have we been 'My carriers are returning home. In exchange, I'm asking you to let them be. The Postman.'
BETHLEHEM: He expects me to believe this?
FORD: It takes a moment for the news to sink in. But it does.
BETHLEHEM: Then I've won. I've won.
BETHLEHEM: You were supposed to kill him.
LUKE: I couldn't get close enough. This one's his second in command.
BETHLEHEM: Why doesn't that surprise me?
BETHLEHEM: Bring out the one we found yesterday. They can die together.
FORD: Who are you?
CAL CARRIER: Name's Clark. Postal Carrier of the restored Republic of California. Who are you?
FORD: Postmaster Ford Lincoln Mercury.
CALI CARRIER: It's an honor.
BETHLEHEM: Wait a minute. wait a minute!
GIBBS: Hold your fire! You don't know each other? This will never be over. It'll go on except I'll be fighting a goddamn ghost.
BETHLEHEM: Hold your fire! You don't know each other? This will never be over. It'll go on except I'll be fighting a goddamn ghost.
GIBBS: Should we fire, sir?
BETHLEHEM: No goddamnit.
BETHLEHEM: No, I won't fight a ghost. Tabula rasa, gentlemen. A clean slate. I want all mail carriers hunted down. I want The Postman found. I want him dealt with. Colonel, organize the scouts. He rode west?
THE POSTMAN: I don't know him. Do you?
ABBY: ( shakes her head ) Where do you think he came from?
SQUATTER: Howdy. Welcome to sunny What happened here?
THE POSTMAN: ( re: the town ) What happened here?
SQUATTER: Little accident. The ground started to shake big time and the Hanford nuclear plant went. . 'Poof.' Destroyed everything for miles. But the sunsets are You ever hear of a city called St. Friend, I've never heard of St.
THE POSTMAN: You ever hear of a city called St. Friend, I've never heard of St.
SQUATTER: Friend, I've never heard of St.
SQUATTER: Hey, don't go! I got Monopoly in the house! Boardwalk, Park Place and the Reading Railroad!
CHUBBY: You think that's President
PONYTAIL: What makes you so sure?
CHUBBY: What makes you so sure?
PONYTAIL: President lives in a white house. That guy's place is gray.
THE POSTMAN: ( re: the tunnel ) We can rest in there.
THE POSTMAN: Did you see that?
ABBY: ( shaking her head ) I'm hungry, Postman.
GUARD: Set the rifle on the ground.
THE POSTMAN: This old thing? It isn't even loaded. Where are we? You're in Bridge City. Where we don't allow guns.
B.C. MAYOR: You're in Bridge City. Where we don't allow guns.
B.C. MAYOR: Sentry said you were coming.
THE POSTMAN: I know you. You're famous.
B.C. MAYOR: I was once. Not anymore. Are you looking to cross?
THE POSTMAN: We will be. Right now, we'd just appreciate some food. I got some kids behind me, too.
B.C. MAYOR: How many?
THE POSTMAN: ( as the Mayor Hey, guys, come on in! I know you're out there!
CHUBBY SENTRY: Boy, is he smart.
B.C. MAYOR: For you and your wife.
THE POSTMAN: Thanks. She's not my wife.
THE POSTMAN: Let me ask you something, have you ever heard of a town with electric St. Rose?
B.C. MAYOR: St. Rose?
THE POSTMAN: B.C. MAYOR
B.C. MAYOR: Never been. But they say it's a ways down on the coast.
THE POSTMAN: How far?
B.C. MAYOR: Couple hundred miles at least. I couldn't say for sure.
THE POSTMAN: You seem like a decent man. And these seem like decent people.
B.C. MAYOR: We try to be.
THE POSTMAN: And this seems like a safe place.
B.C. MAYOR: ( intuitive ) You want to leave her?
THE POSTMAN: All of them. I'll give you the horses and my gear. Abby's special. She's strong. Probably end up running the place.
B.C. MAYOR: Why don't you take the night to think. Decide if that's what you really want.
BRIDGE: As word spreads, folks move down the bridge for a look. Eating their bread, The Postman, Abby and the carriers join them.
EAST END: The Mayor stands across from the lead scout conferring. Finally, the Mayor points him back the way he came. The lead scout doesn't budge, spots The Postman in the crowd. He and The Postman seem to stare at each other forever. Then, with a flick of the reins, he's gone. The other two follow. Swallowed up by the misty evening gloom. The Postman's head swims dizzily. It's not over. The Mayor returns to dozens of nervous questions.
B.C. MAYOR: They're looking for The Postman.
B.C. MAN: No such thing anymore.
B.C. MAYOR: Man on the horse says there is. Says he thinks he's here. Says he's coming back with friends.
B.C. BOY: What's a postman?
ABBY: ( stepping forward ) You never heard of a postman?
ABBY: There used to be a postman for every street in America. They wore uniforms. And hats. Like this one.
B.C. BOY: ( CONTINUED )
ABBY: My postman knew the name of every kid on my street. He knew our birthdays. He'd even find the baseballs you'd hit down the street. I can still see the smile on his face. The tip of his cap when he had a letter in his bag with my name on it. Mine always came just after school. You could set your watch by him. Unless you were waiting on something special like a present from somewhere far away or a letter from your sweetheart. Then it seemed like he'd never come. I used to think they could make time stand still. I don't think we ever really understood what they meant to us until they were gone. Getting a letter made you feel like you were part of something bigger than yourself. No place was ever too far away for the postman. So nobody ever had to be alone. The postman was someone you could count on. Things just made more sense when they were around. That's the kind of world we used to have. A world a lot of us took for granted. And now we've got this one. And it makes me wonder what kind of world do I want my child to live in? I want my child to live in a world where hopes and dreams aren't just lies you tell yourself to get through another day. I want my child, and I want my friends I want all of us to live in a world where you still get your mail.

B.C. MAYOR: ( to The Postman ) Are you The Postman?
THE POSTMAN: B.C. MAYOR THE POSTMAN
B.C. MAYOR: I've heard of you, man. You're Yeah, I guess I am. And all of a sudden, I'm not wearing the right
THE POSTMAN: Yeah, I guess I am. And all of a sudden, I'm not wearing the right
B.C. MAYOR: Fact that we don't allow 'em doesn't mean we don't have 'em. We're not stupid, after all.
THE POSTMAN: I'm sorry I've brought this on No need to be sorry. Long as we get our mail on time.
B.C. MAYOR: No need to be sorry. Long as we get our mail on time.
THE POSTMAN: The order was to burn all
THE POSTMAN: You know what to do then?
PONYTAIL: Talk to the people. Gather who's willing. Tell them it's important. Tell them we can make a difference.
CHUBBY SENTRY: And tell 'em we're going to kick Yeah, tell them that, too.
THE POSTMAN: Yeah, tell them that, too.
ABBY: This is hard for me. Michael was the best man I ever knew. I never thought there'd be another man I could love the way I loved him. I don't know why I've been so blessed. And I've tried to find a way to be thankful, but I swear, if I lose you.
THE POSTMAN: Abby, do you think a lie can become the truth?
ABBY: I don't know, but I believe in you. You have a gift, Postman. I saw it back in Pine View.
ABBY: When you come back, we'll be waiting here for you. So you can take us to St. Rose.
B.C. MAYOR: There's three good-sized towns up that way. Enough folks to be a big help to you. If you can convince them to come.
B.C. MAYOR: A lot higher than it looks, huh?
B.C. MAYOR: Don't tell anybody, but I like to ride the damn thing just for the hell of it. Being a city official has its perks.
B.C. MAYOR: Trust me, man. This'll get you there a lot faster.
THE POSTMAN: How do I stop
B.C. MAYOR: Don't worry about it. Good luck and Godspeed.
COUNTERWEIGHT: Plummeting into the Columbia River Gorge. The Mayor lets out a rebel yell.
BASKET: The Postman is whipped along, past the riders below. The speed exhilarating.
OLD GEORGE: Steady, boys, steady.
GIBBS: In accordance with Law Eight.
OLD GEORGE: Get on with it, you floppy-eared
THE POSTMAN: Riding over the crest. Galloping toward them. Behind him, forty new mail carriers. All riding like mad. One of them carries the flag of the restored United States. Gibbs and his men run for their horses. SHOTS are FIRED. Four Holnists go down. The rest gallop away. The Postman and his carriers meet.
BETHLEHEM: How many?
GIBBS: A least a hundred. With guns.
BETHLEHEM: ( feigning shock ) With guns? Are you sure?
GIBBS: Yes, sir.
BETHLEHEM: Looks more like two hundred to
BETHLEHEM: ( donning a pair of Only thing worse than a coward is one who can't count. Lieutenant, do yourself a favor. Die well in this battle. In my army a deserter's life is a brief and unpleasant one.
BETHLEHEM: ( to himself ) At last, someone with courage enough to bring the fight to me.
BETHLEHEM: Reckoning, gentlemen. This is the day I've dreamed of.
BETHLEHEM: They're an eager-looking bunch. Morale's a dangerous thing. Bring him up. I want this postman to see how the game is played.
THE POSTMAN: ( to carriers ) Stay here. No one moves until I give the orders.
SERGEANT: Are they surrendering?
BETHLEHEM: God, I hope not.
BETHLEHEM: My little shipping clerk.
THE POSTMAN: We're both a couple of frauds. You know it; I know it.
BETHLEHEM: Great men are made by other great men. Patton had Rommel. Grant had Lee. But I get you.
BETHLEHEM: Are you trying to goad me into a Wouldn't it be great if wars could be fought just by the assholes who started them? We could settle this thing right here. You and Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way.
THE POSTMAN: Wouldn't it be great if wars could be fought just by the assholes who started them? We could settle this thing right here. You and Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way.
BETHLEHEM: Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way.
THE POSTMAN: It does in your army.
THE POSTMAN: I invoke law seven of the Laws of Eight! Any man may challenge for leadership of the clan!
BETHLEHEM: The Postman wheels his horse around.
THE POSTMAN: I challenge you.
BETHLEHEM: You're not a Holnist. You're not a member of the clan. You don't have the right.
THE POSTMAN: I have every right. I invoke law
THE POSTMAN: I challenge for leadership of the
BETHLEHEM: Where do I know you from?
THE POSTMAN: 'Cry Havoc! And let slip the dogs of war.' Remember that?
BETHLEHEM: Shakespeare. The one who didn't want to fight.
THE POSTMAN: I should've found a way to kill you then. But you seemed so Law seven it is. This war is settled here!
BETHLEHEM: Law seven it is. This war is settled here!
BETHLEHEM: I study people. I know your problem. Do you know why you can't fight?
BETHLEHEM: You have nothing to fight for. You don't care about anything. You don't value anything. You don't believe in anything. That's what makes me better.
THE POSTMAN: ( barely audible ) I believe in the United States Postal Service.
THE POSTMAN: Neither snow. Nor rain. Nor heat. Nor gloom of night. Will stay this courier from the swift completion of his appointed
THE POSTMAN: It doesn't have to be this way. We don't have to kill each other. We can live together. We can
FORD: Law three. Mercy is for the weak.
THE POSTMAN: Ford, don't.
FORD: Law eight. There is only one penalty and that penalty is death.
THE POSTMAN: He isn't worth it. I'm the head of the clan now! There are going to be new laws! Law one! No more killing! There's going to be peace!
THE POSTMAN: Who else? Who else has a law?
WOMAN: Everyone has to learn how to read.
THE POSTMAN: That's law two. Who else?!
CARRIER #1: Three. Liberty and justice for Four. No more tattoos.
LUKE: Four. No more tattoos.
CARRIER #2: Law five. Give peace a chance!
CARRIER #3: Seven! Bring back vacations!
THE POSTMAN: How about it, Ford Lincoln Mercury? You give us law eight.
THE POSTMAN: ( close for Ford ) Be a leader, Ford.
FORD: Law eight.
FORD: . Live and let live.
BETHLEHEM: Would I had bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in fencing, dancing and bear-baiting. Oh, had I but followed the arts.
THE POSTMAN: Grow like savages as soldiers will that nothing do but mediate on blood.
THE POSTMAN: Somebody take a letter.
CHUBBY: THE POSTMAN
THE POSTMAN: A letter.
ABBY: Your daddy wrote to tell you that he'll be here as soon as he can. And that he loves you very much.
THE POSTMAN: Mail's slow. I'll have to see about that.
ABBY: Your daughter. Her name is Hope.
HOPE: But he never did see St. Rose. There was too much to be done. He'd made a promise and in keeping it he traded one dream for another. With no regrets. And so, in honor of my father.
OLDER MAN: That was me.
