She seems actively en.engaged in all aspects of the learning process. However, her TABE test scores are disappointingly low. ' Not to Miz Rain! Not to Miz Rain! 'She scored 2.8 On her last test.' So what! Miz Rain-
JERMAINE: Get a grip and gon' read the report and don't get all emotional about what this silly hoe got to say. Anyway, if your shit wasn't dope you wouldn't be standing up here readin' -what, what's her name
PRECIOUS: 'She will need at least an 8.0 Before she can enter G.E.D. Class and begin work toward her high school e-q.equivalency.'

PRECIOUS: Finish reading this .I know what's coming.
JERMAINE: 'Although she is in school now, it is not a job readiness program. Nonetheless, Claireece is capable of going to work. In January, her son will be two years old. In keeping with the new initiative on welfare reform, I feel Claireece would benefit from any of the various workfare programs in existence. Despite her obvious intellectual limitations she is quite capable of working as a home I don't want to be no motherfucking home attendant! I wanna be.
PRECIOUS: I don't want to be no motherfucking home attendant! I wanna be.

MS. RAIN: Time is up. Does anyone want to
MS. RAIN: Okay Precious.
PRECIOUS: I don't really want to read all I wrote, I jus' wanna kinda say what it is I'm writing about and how it came about.
AISHA: What happened?
PRECIOUS: Well, to make a long story short, the counselor at Advancement House quizzing me about Mama and Daddy etc., etc. But it's really about workfare. She want to send me out as home attendant.
RHONDA: How you know?
PRECIOUS: Cause I stole my file from Advancement House and read it.
JO ANN: Next time get mine's too.
PRECIOUS: All this 'What you wanna be?' And 'You can talk to me.' They ain' no motherfucking therapists on our side, they just flunkies for the 'fare. I wanna work, but not for no motherfucking welfare check in Central Park -displacing brothers and sisters who really got jobs cleaning up 'cause I'm there working for free.
JERMAINE: And what kinda shit is it for someone like Precious to have quit school before she get her G.E.D. to work at some live-in job for some old-ass crackers. She'll never make a rise she get stuck in some shit like that!
MS. RAIN: Sit up straight Jermaine and watch your language. Both of you. Please.

JERMAINE: Rhonda used to have to go all the way out to Brighton Beach where she work for them people.
PRECIOUS: The people had her there all day and night - 'on call' they call it. But you only get pay for 8 hours so that's 8 X $6.37 = $50.96 a day, but then you is not really getting that much cause you is working more than eight hours a day. You is working 24 hours a day and 50.96 divided by 24 is.
JO ANN: Rhonda say old bitch would ring a bell - a actual bell -when she want Rhonda in the night!
PRECIOUS: Home attendants usually work six days a week. I would only see Abdul on Sundays? When would I go to Am I gonna hafta go be home attendant like Rhonda was?
MS. RAIN: No! So stop worrying about it. We'll cross that bridge when we get to it. Trust me -no, trust yourself. My concern now is that if this Ms. Weiss is someone you're working with and can't trust, she's out! We gotta find somebody else.
PRECIOUS: ( beat ) Well, I just write in my notebook till I get wif some kinda therapist I can trust. Actually that always help me more than talking to her. Plus, I'm going to start going to meetings wif Rita for insect That's what I mean.
