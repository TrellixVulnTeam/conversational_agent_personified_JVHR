THIS KID: lying in bed, coughing. Pale, one sick cookie. Maybe he's seven or eight or nine. He holds a remote in one hand, presses it, and the video game moves a little bit. Then he's hit by another spasm of coughing, puts the remote down. His room is monochromatic, greys and blues, mildly high-tech. We're in the present day and this is a middle class house, somewhere in the suburbs.
MOTHER: You feeling any better?
THE KID: A little bit.
MOTHER: Guess what.
THE KID: Your grandfather's here.
MOTHER: Your grandfather's here.
THE KID: ( not overjoyed ) Mom, can't you tell him that I'm You are sick, that's why he's here.
MOTHER: You are sick, that's why he's here.
THE KID: He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
MOTHER: Maybe he won't.
GRANDFATHER: Hey! How's the sickie? Heh?
MOTHER: I think I'll leave you two pals.
GRANDFATHER: I brought you a special present.
THE KID: What is it?
GRANDFATHER: Open it up.
THE KID: A book?
GRANDFATHER: That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to Has it got any sports in it?
THE KID: Has it got any sports in it?
THE GRANDFATHER: Suddenly passionate.
GRANDFATHER: Are you kidding? Fencing. Fighting. Torture. Revenge. Giants. Monsters. Chases. Escapes. True love.
THE KID: ( manages a shrug ) It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake.
GRANDFATHER: Oh. Well, thank you very much. It's very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. All right. The Princess Bride, by S. Morgenstern. Chapter One. Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin.
GRANDFATHER: ( off-screen ) Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that. ( to the kid ) Isn't that a wonderful beginning?
THE KID: ( off-screen doing his best ) Yeah. It's really good.
GRANDFATHER: ( off-screen reading ) Nothing gave Buttercup as much pleasure as ordering Westley
BUTTERCUP: Farm boy. Polish my horse's saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.
WESTLEY: ( quietly, watching her ) As you wish.
GRANDFATHER: ( off-screen ) "As you wish" was all he ever said to her.
BUTTERCUP: Farm Boy. Fill these with water As you wish.
WESTLEY: As you wish.
GRANDFATHER: ( off-screen ) That day, she was amazed to discover that when he was saying, "As you wish," what he meant was, "I love you."
GRANDFATHER: ( off-screen ) And even more amazing was the day she realized she truly loved him ( pointing to a pitcher that she could reach herself ) Farm Boy, fetch me that pitcher.
BUTTERCUP: ( pointing to a pitcher that she could reach herself ) Farm Boy, fetch me that pitcher.
WESTLEY: As you wish.
THE KID: ( off-screen ) -hold it, hold it-
THE KID: What is this? Are you trying to trick me? Where's the sports? Is this a kissing book?
GRANDFATHER: wait, just wait
THE KID: well, when does it get good?
GRANDFATHER: Keep your shirt on. Let me read. Westley had no money for marriage. So he packed his few belongings and left the farm to seek his fortune across the sea.
GRANDFATHER: ( off-screen reading ) It was a very emotional time for ( off-screen groaning ) I don't be-leeve this.
THE KID: ( off-screen groaning ) I don't be-leeve this.
BUTTERCUP: I fear I'll never see you again.
WESTLEY: Of course you will.
BUTTERCUP: But what if something happens to Hear this now: I will come for you.
WESTLEY: Hear this now: I will come for you.
BUTTERCUP: But how can you be sure?
WESTLEY: This is true love. You think this happens every day?
GRANDFATHER: ( off-screen reading ) Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered
THE KID: ( off-screen, perking up a little ) murdered by pirates is good
GRANDFATHER: ( off-screen ) She went into her room and shut the door. And for days, she neither slept nor ate.
BUTTERCUP: ( no emotion at all in her voice ) I will never love again.
GRANDFATHER: ( off-screen reading ) Five years later, the main square of Florin City was filled as never before to hear the announcement of the great Prince Humperdinck's bride-to be.
HUMPERDINCK: ( raises his hands, starts to speak ) My people . a month from now, our country will have its 500th anniversary. On that sundown, I shall marry a lady who was once a commoner like yourselves ( pause ) but perhaps you will not find her common now. Would you like to meet her?
HUMPERDINCK: My people . the Princess
GRANDFATHER: ( off-screen ) Buttercup's emptiness consumed her. Although the law of the land gave Humperdinck the right to choose his bride, she did not love him.
WOODLANDS: and Buttercup, barreling along, controlling her horse
GRANDFATHER: ( off-screen ) Despite Humperdinck's reassurance that she would grow to love him, the only joy she found was in her daily ride.
VOICE: A word, my lady?
VIZZINI: We are but poor, lost circus performers. Is there a village There is nothing nearby; not for Then there will be no one to hear you scream-
BUTTERCUP: There is nothing nearby; not for Then there will be no one to hear you scream-
VIZZINI: Then there will be no one to hear you scream-
INIGO: What is that you're ripping?
VIZZINI: ( not stopping or turning ) It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder.
FEZZIK: Who's Guilder?
VIZZINI: ( pointing straight out ) The country across the sea. The sworn enemy of Florin. ( slaps the horse's rump )
VIZZINI: Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the Prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love. When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed.
FEZZIK: You never said anything about killing anyone.
VIZZINI: I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
FEZZIK: I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
VIZZINI: ( whirling on Fezzik ) Am I going mad or did the word "think" escape your lips? You were not hired for your brains, you hippopotamic land mass.
INIGO: I agree with Fezzik.
VIZZINI: ( We only thought he was in a fury now he's really getting mad ) Oh. The sot has spoken. What happens to her is not truly your concern I will kill her ( louder ) And remember this never forget
VIZZINI: ( to Inigo ) when I found you, you were so slobbering drunk you couldn't buy ( now to Fezzik, who retreats as much as he can while Vizzini advances ) and you friendless, brainless, helpless, hopeless Do you want me to send you back to where you were, unemployed in ( softly ) That Vizzini, he can fuss. ( a slight emphasis on the last word )
INIGO: ( softly ) That Vizzini, he can fuss. ( a slight emphasis on the last word )
FEZZIK: ( looking at Inigo ) . fuss . fuss . ( Suddenly, he's got it again, emphasis on the last word. ) I think he likes to scream at us.
INIGO: Probably he means no harm.
FEZZIK: He's really very short on charm.
INIGO: ( proudly ) Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
FEZZIK: Yes, some of the time.
VIZZINI: ( whirling on them ) Enough of that.
INIGO: FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?
FEZZIK: If there are, we'll all be dead.
VIZZINI: No more rhymes now, I mean it.
FEZZIK: Anybody want a peanut?
VIZZINI: ( to Inigo ) We'll reach the Cliffs by dawn.
VIZZINI: Why are you doing that?
INIGO: Making sure nobody's following us.
VIZZINI: That would be inconceivable.
BUTTERCUP: Despite what you think, you will be caught. And when you are, the Prince will see you all hanged.
VIZZINI: Of all the necks on this boat, Highness, the one you should be worrying about is your own.
VIZZINI: Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over-
INIGO: You're sure nobody's following us?
VIZZINI: As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
INIGO: No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.
VIZZINI: And suddenly the three whirl, stare back and as they do
VIZZINI: ( explaining with as much logic as he can muster ) Probably some local fisherman out for a pleasure cruise at night through eel-infested waters.
THE BOAT: and Vizzini screaming.
VIZZINI: Go in, get after her!
INIGO: I don't swim.
FEZZIK: ( to the unasked question ) I only dog paddle.
VIZZINI: Veer left. Left. Left!
BUTTERCUP: still close to the boat, switching from a crawl to a silent breast stroke. The wind dies and as it does, something new is heard. A not-too-distant high-pitched shrieking sound. Buttercup stops suddenly, treads water.
THE BOAT: Do you know what that sound is, Highness? Those are the Shrieking Eels if you doubt me, just wait. They always grow louder when they're about to feed on human flesh.
VIZZINI: Do you know what that sound is, Highness? Those are the Shrieking Eels if you doubt me, just wait. They always grow louder when they're about to feed on human flesh.
THE BOAT: If you swim back now, I promise, no harm will come to you. I doubt you will get such an offer from the Eels.
VIZZINI: If you swim back now, I promise, no harm will come to you. I doubt you will get such an offer from the Eels.
GRANDFATHER: ( off-screen ) She doesn't get eaten by the Eels at this time.
THE KID: The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
GRANDFATHER: The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
THE KID: Well, I wasn't nervous.
THE KID: Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned. But that's not the same thing.
GRANDFATHER: Because I can stop now if you want.
THE KID: No. You could read a little bit more . if you want.
GRANDFATHER: ( reading ) "Do you know what that sound is,
VIZZINI: We're back in the boat.
VIZZINI: Those are the Shrieking Eels.
THE KID: ( off-screen ) We're past that, Grandpa.
THE KID: You read it already.
GRANDFATHER: Oh. Oh my goodness, I did. I'm sorry. Beg your pardon.
BUTTERCUP: treading water.
GRANDFATHER: ( off-screen ) All right, all right, let's see. Uh, she was in the water, the Eel was coming after her. She was frightened. The Eel started to charge her. And then -
VIZZINI: Put her down. Just put her down.
INIGO: pointing behind them.
INIGO: I think he's getting closer.
VIZZINI: He's no concern of ours. Sail on! I suppose you think you're brave, don't you?
BUTTERCUP: ( staring deep at him ) Only compared to some.
INIGO: Look! He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.
VIZZINI: Whoever he is, he's too late The Cliffs of Insanity.
THE BOAT: being pursued.
VIZZINI: Hurry up. Move the thing! Um . that other thing. Move it! We're safe only FEZZIK is strong enough to go up our way he'll have to sail around for hours 'til he finds a harbor.
THE CLIFFS: The rope goes all the way to the top.
INIGO: hurrying to FEZZIK. He straps a harness to him, then lifts Buttercup and Vizzini in the harness. Finally, he himself gets in the harness. All three are strapped to FEZZIK like - 20. And he starts to ascend the rope, carrying them all along with him as he goes.
INIGO: ( looking down ) He's climbing the rope. And he's gaining on us.
VIZZINI: He prods FEZZIK, who nods, increases his pace.
VIZZINI: ( shrieking ) I thought I was going faster.
FEZZIK: I thought I was going faster.
VIZZINI: You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
FEZZIK: Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.
VIZZINI: ( cutting through ) I do not accept excuses. ( shaking his head ) I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
FEZZIK: ( hurt ) Don't say that, Vizzini. Please.
VIZZINI: Did I make it clear that your job is at stake?
VIZZINI: cutting through the last of the rope and
THE ROPE: slithering across the ground and out of sight toward the Channel, like some great serpent at last going home.
FEZZIK: standing with Inigo and Buttercup by the cliff edge.
FEZZIK: ( to Inigo impressed ) He has very good arms.
VIZZINI: stunned, turning to the others, looking down.
VIZZINI: He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!
INIGO: ( whirling on Vizzini ) You keep using that word I do not think it means what you think it means. ( looks down again ) My God! He's climbing.
VIZZINI: Whoever he is, he's obviously seen us with the Princess, and must therefore die. You, carry her. We'll head straight for the Guilder frontier. Catch up when he's dead. If he falls, fine. If not, the sword.
INIGO: I want to duel him left-handed.
VIZZINI: You know what a hurry we're in.
INIGO: Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right tch over too quickly.
VIZZINI: ( turns abruptly, starts off-screen ) Oh, have it your way.
FEZZIK: who goes to Inigo.
FEZZIK: You be careful. people in masks cannot be I'm waiting!
VIZZINI: ( calling out ) I'm waiting!
INIGO: He watches them depart, then turns, peers down over the Cliffs. He watches a moment, then paces, shaking his hands loose. He practices a few of his honed fencing skills. He is a taut and nervous fellow, and has never been one for waiting around.
INIGO: walking away. Finally he goes back to cliff edge, starts to talk. It's instant death if the Man In Black falls, but neither gives that possibility much credence. This is our two heroes meeting. They don't know it yet; but that's what it is.
INIGO: ( hollering down ) Hello there.
INIGO: Slow going?
INIGO: MAN IN BLACK
INIGO: I do not suppose you could speed things up?
INIGO: I could do that. In fact, I've got some rope up here. But I do not think that you will accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you.
INIGO: But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
INIGO: I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
INIGO: You don't know any way you'll trust me?
INIGO: I swear on the soul of my father, Domingo Montoya, you will reach the top alive.
INIGO: He dashes to the giant rock the rope was originally tied to.
INIGO: now with a small coil of rope, hurries back to the edge and hurls it over
THE ROPE: It hangs close to the Man In Black. He releases the rocks, grabs the rope, hangs helplessly in space a moment, then looks up at Inigo and
INIGO: straining, forcing his body away from the cliff edge and
INIGO: watching as the Man In Black crawls to safety, then looks to
INIGO: We'll wait until you're ready.
INIGO: I do not mean to pry, but you don't by any chance happen to have six fingers on your right
INIGO: My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. And when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before he was done.
INIGO: The six-fingered man returned and demanded it, but at one-tenth his promised price. My father refused. Without a word, the six-fingered man slashed him through the heart. I loved my father, so, naturally, challenged his murderer to a duel . I failed .
INIGO: I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
INIGO: More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.
INIGO: You are ready, then?
INIGO: You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.
INIGO: And on that word
INIGO: ( thrilled ) You're using Bonetti's defense against me, ah?
INIGO: Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro.
INIGO: Unless the enemy has studied his
INIGO: which I have.
INIGO: And behind him now, drawing closer all the time, is the deadly edge of the Cliffs of Insanity. Inigo fights and ducks and feints and slashes and it all works, but not for long, as gradually the Man In Black keeps the advantage, keeps forcing Inigo back, closer and closer to death.
INIGO: ( happy as a clam ) You are wonderful!
INIGO: I admit it you are better than I am.
INIGO: Because I know something you don't know.
INIGO: I am not left-handed.
INIGO: and the six-fingered sword is all but invisible now, as he increases his attack, then suddenly switches styles again.
INIGO: I ought to be after twenty years.
INIGO: Tell me.
INIGO: And to his amazement, he is being forced back down the steps. He tries one style, another, but it all comes down to the same thing the Man In Black seems to be in control. And before Inigo knows it, the six-fingered sword is knocked clear out of his hand. Inigo retreats, dives from the stairs to a moss-covered bar suspended over the archway. He swings out, lands, and scrambles to his sword and we
INIGO: staring in awe.
INIGO: Who are you?!
INIGO: I must know.
INIGO: CUT TO:
INIGO: moving like lightning, and he thrusts forward, slashes, darts back, all in almost a single movement and
INIGO: And there is never a move anyone makes he doesn't remember, and this time he blocks the slash, slashes out himself with the sixfingered sword. On it goes, back and forth across the rocky terrain, Inigo's feet moving with the grace and speed of a great improvisational dancer.
INIGO: catching it again. And something terrible is written behind his eyes: he has given his all, done everything man can do, tried every style, made every maneuver, but it wasn't enough, and on his face for all to see is the realization that he, Inigo Montoya of Spain, is going to lose.
INIGO: Kill me quickly.
VIZZINI: - 36. PULL BACK TO REVEAL Vizzini, staring down from a narrow mountain path, as far below the Man In Black can be seen running. FEZZIK, carrying the Princess, stands alongside. It's a little later in the
VIZZINI: Give her to me. Catch up with us quickly.
FEZZIK: ( starting to panic ) What do I do?
VIZZINI: Finish him, finish him. Your way.
FEZZIK: Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Which way is my way?
VIZZINI: Pick up one of those rocks, get behind the boulder, and in a few minutes, the Man in Black will come running around the bend. The minute his head is in view, hit it with the rock!
FEZZIK: ( little frown; softly ) My way's not very sportsmanlike.
FEZZIK: He moves into the mountain path. He has picked up another rock and holds it lightly.
FEZZIK: I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss.
FEZZIK: We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
FEZZIK: ( gently ) I could kill you now.
FEZZIK: It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise.
FEZZIK: I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed.
FEZZIK: as he jumps forward with stunning speed for anyone his size and reaches for the Man In Black who drops to his knees, spins loose, and slips between the Giant's legs.
FEZZIK: You're quick.
FEZZIK: ( getting set for another onslaught ) Why do you wear a mask? Were you burned by acid, or something like Oh no. It's just that they're terribly comfortable. I think everyone will be wearing them in the future.
FEZZIK: ( standing, talking as he does so ) I just figured out why you give me so much trouble.
FEZZIK: as he charges toward a huge rock that lines the path, and just as he reaches it he spins his giant body so that the entire weight of the charge is taken by the Man In Black.
FEZZIK: ( his voice just beginning to get a little strained ) Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.
FEZZIK: Well . . you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.
FEZZIK: and there isn't much breath coming.
FEZZIK: as the Man In Black turns him over, puts his ear to FEZZIK's heart. It beats. The Man In Black stands.
PRINCE HUMPERDINCK: as he slips his boot into a foot print in the sand. Count Rugen mounted, watches. Behind him, half a dozen armed WARRIORS, also mounted. A GREAT WHITE HORSE waits riderless in front. Humperdinck is all over the rocky ground, and maybe he isn't the best hunter in the world. Then again, maybe he is. Because, as he begins to put his feet into strange positions, we realize that what he is doing is miming the fencers.
HUMPERDINCK: There was a mighty duel it ranged all over. They were both Who won? How did it end?
RUGEN: Who won? How did it end?
HUMPERDINCK: ( looking down in the position where Inigo fell unconscious ) The loser ran off alone. ( points in the direction Vizzini and FEZZIK took ) The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder!
RUGEN: Shall we track them both?
HUMPERDINCK: The loser is nothing. Only the Princess matters clearly this was all planned by warriors of Guilder. We must be ready for whatever lies ahead.
RUGEN: Could this be a trap?
HUMPERDINCK: ( vaulting onto his horse ) I always think everything could be a trap Which is why I'm still alive.
VIZZINI: So, it is down to you. And it is down to me.
VIZZINI: If you wish her dead, by all means keep moving forward.
VIZZINI: there's nothing to explain. You're trying to kidnap what I've rightfully stolen.
VIZZINI: There will be no arrangement and you're killing her!
BUTTERCUP'S THROAT: as Vizzini jabs with his long knife. Buttercup gasps against the pain.
VIZZINI: I'm afraid so I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.
VIZZINI: Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Really? In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits.
VIZZINI: MAN IN BLACK
VIZZINI: For the Princess?
VIZZINI: To the death?
VIZZINI: I accept.
VIZZINI: ( doing it ) I smell nothing.
VIZZINI: CUT TO:
VIZZINI: watching excitedly as the Man In Black takes the goblets, turns his back. A moment later, he turns again, faces Vizzini, drops the iocane packet. It is now empty. The Man In Black rotates the goblets in a little shell game maneuver then puts one glass in front of Vizzini, the other in front of himself.
VIZZINI: But it's so simple. All I have to do is divine from what I know of you. Are you the sort of man who would put the poison into his own goblet, or his enemy's?
VIZZINI: Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
VIZZINI: Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
VIZZINI: Wait till I get going! Where was I?
VIZZINI: Yes Australia, and you must have suspected I would have known the powder's origin, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
VIZZINI: ( cackling ) You'd like to think that, wouldn't ( stares at the Man in Black ) You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
VIZZINI: ( triumphant ) It has worked you've given everything away I know where the poison is.
VIZZINI: I will. And I choose
VIZZINI: what in the world can that be?
VIZZINI: busily switching the goblets while the Man In Black has his head turned.
VIZZINI: Oh, well, I-I could have sworn I saw something. No matter. What's so funny?
VIZZINI: I'll tell you in a minute. First, let's drink me from my glass, and you from yours.
VIZZINI: ( roaring with laughter ) You only think I guessed wrong ( louder now ) that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool.
VIZZINI: watching him.
VIZZINI: You fell victim to one of the classic blunders. The most famous is "Never get involved in a land war in Asia." But only slightly less well known is this: "Never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line."
BUTTERCUP: Who are you?
BUTTERCUP: ( a final glance back toward Vizzini ) To think all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.
HUMPERDINCK: Someone has beaten a giant! There will be great suffering in Guilder if she dies.
BUTTERCUP: If you'll release me . whatever you ask for ransom . you'll get it, I promise you.
BUTTERCUP: I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me . there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you
BUTTERCUP: I never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That I know.
BUTTERCUP: He knows I do not love him.
BUTTERCUP: I have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever
VIZZINI'S BODY: The picnic is spread as before. CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the Prince kneeling by the body as the others ride up. The Prince grabs the empty poison packet, hands it to Rugen, after first sniffing it himself.
HUMPERDINCK: Iocane. I'd bet my life on it. And there are the Princess's footprints. She is alive . or was, an hour ago. If she is otherwise when I find her, I shall be very put out.
BUTTERCUP: being spun INTO CAMERA view, falling heavily as the Man In Black releases her. We are at the edge of an almost sheer ravine. The drop is sharp and severe. Below, the ravine floor is flat, but getting there would not be half the fun.
BUTTERCUP: ( stares at him ) I know who you are your cruelty reveals everything.
BUTTERCUP: You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it.
BUTTERCUP: You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
BUTTERCUP: You killed my love.
BUTTERCUP: No. A farm boy. Poor. Poor and perfect, with eyes like the sea after a storm.
BUTTERCUP: And probably, if she did not hate Roberts so, there would be
BUTTERCUP: On the high seas, your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners.
BUTTERCUP: You mock my pain!
BUTTERCUP: Nothing you can say will upset me.
BUTTERCUP: And what am I?
BUTTERCUP: You mocked me once, never do it again I died that day!
BUTTERCUP: and while his attention is on the dust cloud, rising high, she pushes him with all the strength she has.
BUTTERCUP: You can die too, for all I care!!
BUTTERCUP: staring transfixed at what she has wrought. There is a long pause. She stands there, alone, as from far below the words come to her, drifting on the wind
BUTTERCUP: Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I
HUMPERDINCK: Disappeared. He must have seen us closing in, which might account for his panicking in error. Unless I'm wrong, and I am never wrong, they are headed dead into the fire swamp.
COUNT RUGEN: The mere mention of the Fire Swamp makes him pale.
BUTTERCUP: bruised and torn, as Westley crawls slowly toward her.
WESTLEY: Can you move at all?
BUTTERCUP: ( weakly stretching out an arm toward him ) Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
WESTLEY: I told you, "I would always come for you." Why didn't you wait for Well . you were dead.
BUTTERCUP: Well . you were dead.
WESTLEY: Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
BUTTERCUP: I will never doubt again.
WESTLEY: There will never be a need.
THE KID: ( off-screen ) Oh no. No, please.
GRANDFATHER: What is it? What's the matter?
THE KID: They're kissing again, do we have to hear the kissing part?
GRANDFATHER: Someday, you may not mind so much.
THE KID: Skip on to the Fire Swamp that sounded good.
GRANDFATHER: Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you. So now, where were we here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley and Buttercup raced along the ravine floor.
WESTLEY: Ha. Your pig fiance is too late. A few more steps and we'll be safe in the Fire Swamp.
WESTLEY: Ha. Your pig fiance is too late. A few more steps and we'll be safe in the Fire Swamp.
BUTTERCUP: and Westley has tried to say it with Chevalier-like nonchalance, but she ain't buying.
BUTTERCUP: We'll never survive.
WESTLEY: Nonsense you're only saying that because no one ever has.
WESTLEY: It's not that bad. I'm not saying I'd like to build a summer home here, but the trees are actually quite lovely.
WESTLEY: instantly forcing Buttercup to sit, gathering her flaming hem in his hands, doing his best to suffocate the fire. This isn't all that easy and it causes him a bit of grief, but he does his best to sound as jaunty as before.
WESTLEY: Well now, that was an adventure.
WESTLEY: Singed a bit, were you?
BUTTERCUP: ( She wasn't and she shakes her head "no" )
WESTLEY: Well, one thing I will say. The Fire Swamp certainly does keep you on your toes.
WESTLEY: ( happily ) This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship "Revenge" is anchored at the far end. And I, as you know, am But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years I myself am often surprised at life's little quirks.
BUTTERCUP: But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years I myself am often surprised at life's little quirks.
WESTLEY: I myself am often surprised at life's little quirks.
WESTLEY: You see, what I told you before about saying "please" was true. It intrigued Roberts, as did my descriptions of your beauty.
WESTLEY: Finally, Roberts decided something. He said, "All right, Westley, I've never had a valet. You can try it for tonight. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." Three years he said that. "Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." It was a fine time for me. I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me. And Roberts and I eventually became friends. And then it happened.
BUTTERCUP: What? go on
WESTLEY: Well, Roberts had grown so rich, he wanted to retire. So he took me to his cabin and told me his secret. "I am not the Dread Pirate Roberts," he said. "My name is Ryan. I inherited this ship from the previous Dread Pirate Roberts, just as you will inherit it from me. The man I inherited it from was not the real Dread Pirate Roberts, either.
WESTLEY: So we sailed ashore, took on an entirely new crew and he stayed aboard for awhile as first mate, all the time calling me Roberts. Once the crew believed, he left the ship and I have been Roberts ever since. Except, now that we're together, I shall retire and hand the name over to someone else. Is everything clear to you?
WESTLEY WHIRLING: slashing at a U-shaped vine, hacks it in half it's still connected to the tree. Then be grabs it, drops his sword, and, clutching the other end of the vine, he dives into the lightning sand and there is another cloud of white powder, but it settles quickly. Now nothing can be seen. Nothing at all. Just the lightning sand, lovely and lethal.
BUTTERCUP: placed against a tree. Westley is cleaning the lightning sand from her face. He hesitates, glances around and
BUTTERCUP: We'll never succeed we may as well die here.
WESTLEY: No. No. We have already succeeded.
WESTLEY: I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurts. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that. Two, the Lightning Sand. But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too.
BUTTERCUP: Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
WESTLEY: Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't think they exist.
BUTTERCUP: screaming and Westley, pinned under the attacking R.0.U.S., trying to fend it off. Can't. The thing's teeth sink deep into his arm. He Westley drives a fist into the beast's face, rolling it off. He reaches for his sword just a few feet away, but the R.0.U.S. is back atop him. It's a fierce battle, and just when we think Westley can't possibly win, he flips the ugly rodent clear. Westley scrambles for his sword. The R.0.U.S. stampedes on, changing its target, heading right for Buttercup, and she's scared to death and
BUTTERCUP: Westley abandons his sword, reaching for the rodent, grabbing only a tail, wrestling with it. Buttercup grabs a small branch, and using it as a club, beats the skull of the thing, doing pretty well, but the beast manages to snag her hem with its razor teeth, and she's pulled to the ground, and
WESTLEY: jumping onto its back, and the R.0.U.S. is all over him now, sinking needle teeth into Westley's shoulder.
WESTLEY: with death close at hand, as a popping sound starts. He tries one desperate move, rolls into the sound
WESTLEY: with the R.0.U.S. pinned under him, and as the beast bursts into flame, it lets go and Westley rolls safely free, grabs his sword and exhaustedly stabs the R.0.U.S., which is trying to put itself out. The R.0.U.S. collapses dead. Westley stands motionless, exhausted. The danger has passed.
BUTTERCUP: DISSOLVE TO:
BUTTERCUP: ( almost in disbelief ) We did it.
WESTLEY: Now, was that so terrible?
HUMPERDINCK: It's dusk. Behind Humperdinck are the waters of the bay.
WESTLEY: You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.
HUMPERDINCK: I give you full marks for bravery don't make yourself a Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.
WESTLEY: Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.
HUMPERDINCK: I tell you once again surrender!
WESTLEY: It will not happen!
BUTTERCUP: looking from one to the other; then something else catches her eye and we
BUTTERCUP: looking the other way
ANOTHER WARRIOR: crossbow aimed at Westley.
HUMPERDINCK: ( roaring ) For the last time SURRENDER!
WESTLEY: ( roaring right back, bigger )
DEATH FIRST!!: CUT TO:
BUTTERCUP: frantically staring around, and now
BUTTERCUP: Will you promise not to hurt him?
HUMPERDINCK: whirling to face her.
HUMPERDINCK: What was that?
WESTLEY: whirling to face her.
WESTLEY: What was that?
BUTTERCUP: talking to them both.
BUTTERCUP: If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
HUMPERDINCK: May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
BUTTERCUP: ( looks at Westley ) He is a sailor on the pirate ship "Revenge." Promise to return him to his ship.
HUMPERDINCK: I swear it will be done.
HUMPERDINCK: ( whispering ) Once we're out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair.
RUGEN: ( almost a smile ) I swear it will be done.
BUTTERCUP: I thought you were dead once, and it almost destroyed me. I could not bear it if you died again, not when I could save you.
WESTLEY: staring after her. Rugen watches as his warriors bring Westley to him. The Count has a heavy sword and he holds it in his hand.
RUGEN: Come, sir. We must get you to your ship.
WESTLEY: We are men of action. Lies do not become us.
RUGEN: Well spoken, sir
RUGEN: what is it?
WESTLEY: You have six fingers on your right hand someone was looking for you
WESTLEY: Where am I?
ALBINO: ( he only whispers ) The Pit of Despair.
ALBINO: ( garbled ) Don't even think ( A hack, sputter, cough - now his voice seems normal again ) don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. And only the Prince, the Count, and I know how to get in and out.
WESTLEY: Then I'm here till I die?
ALBINO: ( working away ) Till they kill you. Yeah.
WESTLEY: Then why bother curing me?
ALBINO: The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.
WESTLEY: So it's to be torture.
WESTLEY: I can cope with torture.
WESTLEY: You don't believe me?
ALBINO: You survived the Fire Swamp. You must be very brave. . but nobody withstands The
BUTTERCUP: and her face is sad. Pallid, perhaps ill. She wanders down a corridor in Florin Castle. As she moves unseeing past an intersecting corridor:
HUMPERDINCK: She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp. It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.
RUGEN: ( unbelieving ) Of course.
GRANDFATHER: ( off-screen ) The King died that very night, and before the following dawn, Buttercup and Humperdinck were
GRANDFATHER: ( off-screen ) And at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.
HUMPERDINCK: My father's final words were.
THE KID: ( off-screen ) hold it. Hold it, Grandpa.
THE KID: You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair.
GRANDFATHER: Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
THE KID: I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
GRANDFATHER: Do you want me to go on with this?
THE KID: All right, then. No more . at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.
GRANDFATHER: All right, then. No more . at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.
PRINCE HUMPERDINCK: My father's final words were "love her as I loved her, and there will be joy." I present to you your Queen. Queen Buttercup.
HUMPERDINCK: My father's final words were "love her as I loved her, and there will be joy." I present to you your Queen. Queen Buttercup.
THE CROWD: and it's gigantic.
THE ARCHWAY: we saw before, as Buttercup emerges.
THE CROWD: suddenly going to its knees, wave after wave of silent KNEELING PEOPLE. All of them down.
BUTTERCUP: touched as before, but then she seems stunned as we
THE CROWD: SOMEONE IS BOOING! The BOOING gets louder as an ANCIENT WOMAN approaches Buttercup through the crowd, BOOING every step of the way.
BUTTERCUP: Why do you do this?
ANCIENT BOOER: Because you had love in your hands, and you gave it up.
BUTTERCUP: ( distraught ) But they would have killed Westley if I hadn't done it.
ANCIENT BOOER: Your true love lives and you marry another True love saved her in the Fire Swamp, and she treated it like garbage. And that's what she is, the Queen of Refuse! So, bow down to her if you want. Bow to her. Bow to the Queen of Slime, the Queen of Filth, the Queen of Putrescence. Boo! Boo! Rubbish! Filth! Slime! Muck! Boo! Boo!
BUTTERCUP: coming out of her nightmare, alone in her castle bedroom. As she frantically grabs a robe and starts to run.
GRANDFATHER: ( off-screen, still reading ) It was ten days till the wedding. The King still lived, but Buttercup's nightmares were growing steadily worse.
THE KID: ( off-screen ) See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten ( off-screen ) yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up.
GRANDFATHER: ( off-screen ) yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up.
BUTTERCUP: bursting into the Prince's chambers. Count Rugen stands - 73. PRINCE HUMPERDINCK Just stunned. Finally, softly, he begins to talk.
BUTTERCUP: It comes to this: I love Westley. I always have. I know now I always will. If you tell me I must marry you in ten days, please believe I will be dead by
PRINCE HUMPERDINCK: Just stunned. Finally, softly, he begins to talk.
HUMPERDINCK: I could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off. You returned this Westley to his Then we will simply alert him. Beloved, are you certain he still wants you? After all, it was you who did the leaving in the Fire Swamp. Not to mention that pirates are not known to be men of their words.
RUGEN: Then we will simply alert him. Beloved, are you certain he still wants you? After all, it was you who did the leaving in the Fire Swamp. Not to mention that pirates are not known to be men of their words.
HUMPERDINCK: Then we will simply alert him. Beloved, are you certain he still wants you? After all, it was you who did the leaving in the Fire Swamp. Not to mention that pirates are not known to be men of their words.
BUTTERCUP: My Westley will always come for me.
HUMPERDINCK: I suggest a deal. You write four copies of a letter. I'll send my four fastest ships. One in each direction. The Dread Pirate Roberts is always close to Florin this time of year. We'll run up the white flag and deliver your message. If Westley wants you, bless you both. If not . please consider me as an alternative to suicide. Are we agreed?
RUGEN: Your Princess is really a winning creature. A trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is Oh, I know. The people are quite taken with her. It's odd, but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, I thought that was clever. But it's going to be so much more moving when I strangle her on our wedding night. Once Guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged. They'll demand we go to
HUMPERDINCK: Oh, I know. The people are quite taken with her. It's odd, but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, I thought that was clever. But it's going to be so much more moving when I strangle her on our wedding night. Once Guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged. They'll demand we go to
RUGEN: Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find. Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. I am starting him on The Machine Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work. But, I've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm Get some rest if you haven't got your health, you haven't got
HUMPERDINCK: Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work. But, I've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm Get some rest if you haven't got your health, you haven't got
RUGEN: Get some rest if you haven't got your health, you haven't got
RUGEN: Beautiful, isn't it?
RUGEN: It took me half a lifetime to invent it. I'm sure you've discovered my deep and abiding interest in pain. At present I'm writing the definitive work on the subject. So I want you to be totally honest with me on how The Machine makes you feel.
A DIAL: with numbers ranging from a low of "1" to a high of "50." Rugen goes to it.
RUGEN: This being our first try, I'll use the lowest setting.
WESTLEY: He has suction cups on his head now, on his temple, on his heart, his hands and feet. He says nothing, keeps control of COUNT RUGEN fiddling with his Machine a moment more. And then he opens the flood gate, water pours down the chute, turning the wheel, which in turn really gets The Machine going.
COUNT RUGEN: fiddling with his Machine a moment more. And then he opens the flood gate, water pours down the chute, turning the wheel, which in turn really gets The Machine going.
WESTLEY: and he's lying on the table, and he's only flesh and the chains are metal and thick, but such is his desperation it almost seems he might break them. A terrible sound comes from his throat, an incessant gasping. It keeps on coming as we finally
COUNT RUGEN: He switches off The Machine, picks up a large notebook and pen, sits in a chair. The NOISE of The Machine subsides. Rugen opens the book to a blank page.
RUGEN: As you know, the concept of the suction pump is centuries old. Well, really, that's all this is. Except that instead of sucking water, I'm sucking life. I've just sucked one year of your life away. I might one day go as high as five, but I really don't know what that would do to you. So, let's just start with what we have. What did this do to you? Tell me. And remember, this is for posterity, so be honest how do you feel?
WESTLEY: in anguish so deep it is dizzying. Helpless, he cries. Count Rugen watches the tears, then starts to write.
RUGEN: CUT TO:
HUMPERDINCK: in his quarters, swamped. Piles of papers are strewn all over. Now YELLIN, a pale, shifty, quick-eyed man appears in the doorway.
HUMPERDINCK: ( bows, then kneels ) As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.
YELLIN: ( bows, then kneels ) As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.
HUMPERDINCK: As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.
YELLIN: My spy network has heard no such Any word from Westley?
BUTTERCUP: Any word from Westley?
BUTTERCUP: Any word from Westley?
HUMPERDINCK: Too soon, my angel. Patience.
BUTTERCUP: He will come for me.
HUMPERDINCK: Of course.
HUMPERDINCK: She will not be murdered. On the day of the wedding, I want the Thieves' Forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested.
YELLIN: Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
HUMPERDINCK: Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
YELLIN: It won't be easy, Sire.
HUMPERDINCK: ( alone, exhausted ) Try ruling the world sometime.
GRANDFATHER: ( off-screen ) The day of the wedding arrived. The Brute Squad had their hands full carrying out Humperdinck's ( to an unpleasantlooking assistant ) Is everybody out?
YELLIN: ( to an unpleasantlooking assistant ) Is everybody out?
ASSISTANT BRUTE: Almost. There's a Spaniard giving us some trouble.
YELLIN: Well, you give him some trouble.
INIGO: drunk as a skunk, sprawled in front of a hovel, a bottle of brandy in one hand, the six-fingered sword in the other. He looks dreadful. Unshaven, puffy-eyed, gaunt. But the way he brandishes the great sword in front of him would give anyone cause for worry.
INIGO: I am waiting for you, Vizzini. You told me to go back to the beginning. So I have. This is where I am, and this is where I'll stay. I will not be moved.
ASSISTANT BRUTE: Ho there.
INIGO: I do not budge. Keep your "Ho
ASSISTANT BRUTE: But the Prince gave orders
INIGO: So did Vizzini when a job went wrong, you went back to the beginning. And this is where we got the job. So it's the beginning, and I'm staying till Vizzini comes.
ASSISTANT BRUTE: ( gesturing off-screen ) You! Brute! Come here.
INIGO: I am waiting for You surely are a meanie.
VOICE: ( off-screen ) You surely are a meanie.
FEZZIK: It's you.
INIGO: It's you.
FEZZIK: And as the Assistant Brute is just about to club Inigo's brains out, FEZZIK lets fly with a stupendous punch. The Assistant Brute takes the full force of the blow right in the chops. It's like he was shot from a cannon as he careens backwards out of sight across the street. There is a pause. Then a crunching sound, as he clearly has come in contact with something hard and immobile. FEZZIK puts Inigo down.
FEZZIK: You don't look so good. You don't smell so good either.
INIGO: Perhaps not. I feel fine.
FEZZIK: And so FEZZIK puts Inigo down. That's when Inigo faints, and as he does,
GRANDFATHER: ( off-screen ) FEZZIK and Inigo were reunited. And as FEZZIK nursed his inebriated friend back to health, he told Inigo of Vizzini's death and the existence of Count Rugen, the sixfingered man. Considering Inigo's lifelong search, he handled the news surprisingly well.
GRANDFATHER: ( off-screen ) Fezzik took great care in reviving ( up and going ) That's enough. That's enough! Where is this Rugen so I may kill He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
INIGO: ( up and going ) That's enough. That's enough! Where is this Rugen so I may kill He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
FEZZIK: He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
INIGO: How many could you handle?
FEZZIK: I don't think more than ten.
INIGO: ( doing the math on his fingers ) That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I could never defeat that ( he sinks sadly down ) I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for strategy.
FEZZIK: But Vizzini's dead.
INIGO: No not Vizzini I need the Man in Black
FEZZIK: look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's To find the Man in Black, But you don't know where he is.
INIGO: look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's To find the Man in Black, But you don't know where he is.
FEZZIK: To find the Man in Black, But you don't know where he is.
INIGO: To find the Man in Black, But you don't know where he is.
FEZZIK: But you don't know where he is.
INIGO: ( he is possessed by demons now ) Don't bother me with trifles; after twenty years, at last, my father's soul will be at peace.
INIGO: ( big ) There will be blood tonight!!
HUMPERDINCK: ( sharpening his dagger ) Rise and report.
YELLIN: The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.
HUMPERDINCK: Double it. My Princess must be The gate has but one key, and I carry that.
YELLIN: The gate has but one key, and I carry that.
HUMPERDINCK: Ah! My dulcet darling. Tonight we marry. Tomorrow morning, your men will escort us to Florin Channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our Every ship but your four fastest, you mean.
BUTTERCUP: Every ship but your four fastest, you mean.
BUTTERCUP: Every ship but the four you sent.
HUMPERDINCK: Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
YELLIN: ( bows, exits ) Your Majesties.
BUTTERCUP: staring at Humperdinck.
BUTTERCUP: You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.
HUMPERDINCK: ( sharply ) You're a silly girl.
BUTTERCUP: Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.
HUMPERDINCK: ( close to erupting; speaks very distinctly ) I-would-not-say-such things-if- Why not? You can't hurt me. Westley and I are joined by the bonds of love. And you cannot track that. Not with a thousand bloodhounds. And you cannot break it. Not with a thousand swords. And when I say you are a coward, that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth.
BUTTERCUP: Why not? You can't hurt me. Westley and I are joined by the bonds of love. And you cannot track that. Not with a thousand bloodhounds. And you cannot break it. Not with a thousand swords. And when I say you are a coward, that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth.
HUMPERDINCK: jumping at her, yanking her by the hair, starting to pull her along, out of control, his words indistinct.
HUMPERDINCK: CUT TO:
IWOULDNOTSAYSUCHTHINGSIFIWEREYOU!: CUT TO:
HUMPERDINCK: ( at Westley ) You truly love each other, and so you might have been truly happy. Not one couple in a century has that chance, no matter what the storybooks say. And so I think no man in a century will suffer as greatly as you will.
COUNT RUGEN: calling out
RUGEN: Not to fifty!!!
PRINCE HUMPERDINCK: shoving the lever all the way up and
WESTLEY'S FACE: And there has never been such pain. The pain grows and grows and with it now, something else has started THE DEATH SCREAM. As The Death Scream starts to rise
INIGO: ( instantly )
FEZZIK: The Man in Black?
INIGO: His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering? Excuse me
INIGO: pardon me, it's important
INIGO: Fezzik, please
FEZZIK: ( gigantic and roaring ) Everybody . MOVE!!
INIGO: Thank you.
INIGO: Where is the Man in Black?
INIGO: You get there from this grove, yes? Fezzik, jog his memory.
INIGO: Fezzik, jog his memory.
FEZZIK: ( upset ) I'm sorry, Inigo. I didn't mean to jog him so hard. Inigo?
INIGO: He kneels, the sword held tight between his hands. Eyes closed, he faces the grove of trees, starts to talk, his voice low and strange.
INIGO: Father, I have failed you for twenty years. Now our misery can end. Somewhere . somewhere close by is a man who can help us. I cannot find him alone. I need you. I need you to guide my sword.
INIGO: Guide my sword.
INIGO: walking blind through the grove of trees. He moves to the Secret Knot, hesitates, then moves past it. Then Inigo stops. For a long moment he stands frozen. Suddenly he whirls, eyes still closed, and the sword strikes home dead center into a knot and Nothing. He has failed. In utter despair he collapses against the tree. Against a knot in the tree. Against THE KNOT in the tree. It slides away, revealing the staircase. FEZZIK and Inigo look at each other, then start down.
WESTLEY: dead by The Machine. FEZZIK leans over him, listening for a heartbeat. Then he looks at Inigo, shakes his head.
FEZZIK: He's dead.
INIGO: ( barely able to speak ) It just is not fair.
THE KID: ( off-screen ) Grandpa, Grandpa wait
THE KID: wait what did FEZZIK mean, "He's dead?" I mean he didn't mean dead.
THE KID: Westley's only faking, right?
GRANDFATHER: You want me to read this or not?
THE KID: Who gets Humperdinck?
GRANDFATHER: I don't understand.
THE KID: Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who?
GRANDFATHER: Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives.
THE KID: You mean he wins? Jesus, Grandpa! What did you read me this thing
GRANDFATHER: You know, you've been very sick and you're taking this story very seriously. I think we better stop
THE KID: ( shaking his head ) No! I'm okay. I'm okay. ( gestures toward the chair ) sit down. All right?
GRANDFATHER: ( sitting and opening the book again ) All right, now, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of
INIGO: Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.
FEZZIK: The body?
INIGO: ( not stopping ) Have you any money?
FEZZIK: I have a little.
INIGO: I just hope it's enough to buy a miracle, that's all.
MIRACLE MAX: ( opening a small window in the door ) What? What?
INIGO: Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those The King's stinking son fired me. And thank you so much for bringing up such a painful subject. While you're at it, why don't you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it? We're closed!
MIRACLE MAX: The King's stinking son fired me. And thank you so much for bringing up such a painful subject. While you're at it, why don't you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it? We're closed!
MIRACLE MAX: ( opening the window ) Beat it or I'll call the Brute I'm on the Brute Squad.
FEZZIK: I'm on the Brute Squad.
MIRACLE MAX: ( looking at the Giant ) You are the Brute Squad.
INIGO: We need a miracle. It's very Look, I'm retired. And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired? I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.
MIRACLE MAX: Look, I'm retired. And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired? I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.
INIGO: He's already dead.
MIRACLE MAX: ( for the first time, interested ) He is, eh? I'll take a look. Bring him in.
MIRACLE MAX: I've seen worse.
INIGO: Sir. Sir.
MIRACLE MAX: We're really in a terrible rush.
INIGO: We're really in a terrible rush.
MIRACLE MAX: ( He takes nothing from nobody ) Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?
INIGO: MIRACLE MAX
MIRACLE MAX: Sheesh! I never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause.
INIGO: This is noble, sir. His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation.
MIRACLE MAX: Are you a rotten liar.
INIGO: I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty Your first story was better. Where's that bellows? He probably owes you money, huh? Well, I'll ask him.
MIRACLE MAX: Your first story was better. Where's that bellows? He probably owes you money, huh? Well, I'll ask him.
INIGO: ( stupefied ) He's dead. He can't talk.
MIRACLE MAX: Look who knows so much. Well, it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Please open his mouth.
MIRACLE MAX: Now, mostly dead is slightly alive. Now, all dead.well, with all dead, there's usually only one thing that you can do.
INIGO: What's that?
MIRACLE MAX: Go through his clothes and look for loose change.
MIRACLE MAX: ( to Westley ) Hey! Hello in there. Hey! What's so important? What you got here that's worth living for?
WESTLEY: . tr . oooo .. luv.
INIGO: True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that.
MIRACLE MAX: Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world. Except for a nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe. They're so perky, I love that. But that's not what he said. He distinctly said "to blave." And, as we all know, "to blave" means "to bluff." So you're probably playing cards, and he
MIRACLE MAX: get back, witch
VALERIE: I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that You never had it so good.
MIRACLE MAX: You never had it so good.
VALERIE: "True love." He said, "true love," Max. My God
MIRACLE MAX: ( retreating ) Don't say another word, Valerie.
VALERIE: ( turning to Inigo and Fezzik ) He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
MIRACLE MAX: Why'd you say that name you promised me that you would never say that name
VALERIE: ( pursuing him now ) What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck
MIRACLE MAX: ( holding his hands over his ears ) I'm not listening.
VALERIE: A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help
MIRACLE MAX: Nobody's hearing nothing!
VALERIE: Humperdinck. Humperdinck! love If you heal him, he will stop Humperdinck's wedding.
INIGO: But this is Buttercup's true love If you heal him, he will stop Humperdinck's wedding.
VALERIE: Humperdinck. Humperdinck
MIRACLE MAX: ( to Valerie ) Shut up ( now to Inigo ) Wait. Wait. I make him better, Humperdinck suffers?
INIGO: Humiliations galore!
MIRACLE MAX: That is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job.
THIS LUMP: It is somewhat smaller than a tennis ball. PULL BACK TO REVEAL MAX AND VALERIE, exhausted, looking at the lump with beautific pleasure, as Valerie, cooking utensil in hand, covers the thing with what looks like chocolate. Inigo and FEZZIK stare at the thing too, but more Max nods.
INIGO: ( a little appalled ) That's a miracle pill?
VALERIE: ( finishing ) The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?
MIRACLE MAX: An hour.
VALERIE: Yeah, an hour.
MIRACLE MAX: A good hour. Yeah.
INIGO: ( heading out the door, Fezzik close behind ) Thank you for everything.
MIRACLE MAX: - 97.
VALERIE: ( waving after them ) Bye-bye, boys.
MIRACLE MAX: Have fun storming the castle.
VALERIE: ( to Max ) Think it'll work?
MIRACLE MAX: It would take a miracle. Bye!
VALERIE: And as they wave, trying to look happy we
FEZZIK: Inigo there's more than What's the difference? We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
INIGO: ( absolutely unfazed ) What's the difference? ( indicating the half- dead Westley ) We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
FEZZIK: Has it been fifteen minutes?
INIGO: We can't wait the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle
INIGO: Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.
FEZZIK: ( following orders ) How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle
INIGO: Pill in hand, he drops it into Westley's mouth.
INIGO: Your guess is as good as mine
WESTLEY: ( frantic ) I'll beat you both apart. I'll take you both together.
FEZZIK: Guess not very long.
WESTLEY: Why won't my arms move?
FEZZIK: You've been mostly dead all day.
INIGO: We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back.
WESTLEY: Who are you? Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? Where's Let me explain No, there is too much. Let me sum up.
INIGO: Let me explain No, there is too much. Let me sum up.
WESTLEY: That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.
FEZZIK: You've just wiggled your finger. That's wonderful.
WESTLEY: I've always been a quick healer. What are our liabilities?
INIGO: There is but one working castle
INIGO: And it is guarded by sixty men.
WESTLEY: And our assets?
INIGO: Your brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel.
WESTLEY: absolutely stunned.
WESTLEY: That's it? Impossible. If I had a month to plan, maybe I could come up with something. But this.
FEZZIK: ( trying to be cheery ) You just shook your head that doesn't make you happy?
WESTLEY: My brains, his steel, and your strength against sixty men, and you think a little head jiggle is supposed to make me happy? I mean, if we only had a wheelbarrow, that would be Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
INIGO: Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
FEZZIK: Over the Albino, I think.
WESTLEY: Well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place? What I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.
INIGO: There we cannot help you.
FEZZIK: ( pulling one out ) Will this do?
INIGO: ( to Fezzik surprised ) Where did you get that?
FEZZIK: At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice, he said I could keep it.
WESTLEY: All right, all right. Come on, help me up.
WESTLEY: Now, I'll need a sword eventually.
INIGO: Why? You can't even lift one.
WESTLEY: True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it? Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
INIGO: I'll say how do I find the Count? Once I do, how do I find you again? Once I find you again, how do we escape?
FEZZIK: ( sharply ) Don't pester him, he's had a hard ( nods ) Right, right, sorry.
INIGO: ( nods ) Right, right, sorry.
FEZZIK: I hope we win.
INIGO: I hope we win.
FEZZIK: I hope we win.
BUTTERCUP: in her bridal gown, and she's incredible. It's not just her beauty; there's a tranquillity about her now.
HUMPERDINCK: You don't seem excited, my little Should I be?
BUTTERCUP: Should I be?
HUMPERDINCK: Brides often are, I'm told.
BUTTERCUP: ( gently, confidently ) I do not marry tonight.
BUTTERCUP: and she couldn't seem more serene.
BUTTERCUP: My Westley will save me.
HER WESTLEY: looking down on the gate with Inigo and Fezzik.
IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN: ( clears his throat, begins to speak ) Mawidge.mawidge is what bwings us togewer today.
IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN: Mawidge, the bwessed awwangement, that dweam wiffim a dweam.
YELLIN: ( off-screen ) Stand your ground, men. Stand your ground.
YELLIN: Stand your ground.
FEZZIK: ( deep and booming )
FEZZIK: and he seems to be floating because he's standing in the wheelbarrow, as Inigo, hidden behind him, busts a gut by pushing it and supporting Westley.
INIGO: Not yet.
WESTLEY: Not yet.
FEZZIK: MY MEN ARE HERE, AND I AM HERE, BUT SOON YOU WILL NOT BE HERE
YELLIN: keeping the Brutes in position, or trying to, shouting orders, instructions and as yet the Brutes hold. Now
INIGO: Light him.
WESTLEY: Light him.
THE BRUTES: as the Giant bursts suddenly, happily into flames.
FEZZIK: ( roaring )
IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN: . Ven wuv, twoo wuv, wiw fowwow you fowever..
FEZZIK: THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS IS HERE FOR YOUR SOULS! Stay where you are. I said stay where you are!
YELLIN: as suddenly the Brutes just scream and take off in wild
YELLIN: Stay where you are. I said stay where you are!
IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN: . so tweasuwe your vruv..
HUMPERDINCK: Skip to the end.
IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN: Have you the wing? Here comes my Westley now.
BUTTERCUP: Here comes my Westley now.
WESTLEY: FEZZIK, the portcullis.
THE CHAPEL: as Humperdinck shoves the ring on Buttercup's finger
HUMPERDINCK: Your Westley is dead.
HUMPERDINCK: I killed him myself.
BUTTERCUP: ( never more serene ) Then why is there fear behind your eyes?
PRINCE HUMPERDINCK: And she's right. It's there.
YELLIN: pressed against the main gate. Westley, Inigo, and FEZZIK close in.
WESTLEY: Give us the gate key.
YELLIN: ( every ounce of honesty he's got ) I have no gate key.
INIGO: Fezzik, tear his arms off.
FEZZIK: steps toward him.
YELLIN: Oh, you mean this gate key.
IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN: And do you, Pwincess Buwwercwup.
HUMPERDINCK: Man and wife say man and wife.
IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN: Man and wife.
HUMPERDINCK: ( whirling to the King and Queen ) Escort the bride to the Honeymoon Suite I'll be there shortly.
BUTTERCUP: standing there. Dazed.
BUTTERCUP: He didn't come.
COUNT RUGEN: as the confrontation is about to start.
RUGEN: Kill the dark one and the giant, but leave the third for
INIGO: ( to Rugen, evenly and soft ) Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to
COUNT RUGEN: For a moment he just stands there, sword in hand. Then he does a most unexpected thing. He turns and runs the hell away.
INIGO: momentarily surprised, then taking off after him, leaving Westley and Fezzik to exchange curious looks and Rugen, running through a half-open heavy wooden door, shutting it and locking it just as Inigo throws himself against it. He tries again. No kind of chance.
INIGO: ( calling out ) Fezzik, I need you
FEZZIK: ( indicating Westley ) I can't leave him alone.
INIGO: desperately pounding at the heavy door.
INIGO: He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. FEZZIK!
FEZZIK: ( to Westley ) I'll be right back.
INIGO: still hammering the door. Fezzik approaches, gestures for him to stop, and with one mighty swipe of his mighty hands the door crumbles
INIGO: Thank you
KING: ( can hardly be understood ) Strange wedding.
QUEEN: Yes. A very strange wedding. Come
KING: What was that for?
BUTTERCUP: Because you've always been so kind to me. And I won't be seeing you again since I'm killing myself once we reach the Honeymoon Won't that be nice? She kissed me.
KING: ( smiling away his hearing isn't what it once was ) Won't that be nice? ( calling out to the Queen ) She kissed me.
COUNT RUGEN: And he's running, dashing through corridors and as he glances back
INIGO: behind him, coming like a streak and
THE INTERSECTION: with the large suit of armor, and Fezzik gaping, staring at all those choices, trying to piece together the puzzle of the missing Westley.
COUNT RUGEN: flashing out of one room, down a staircase, picking up his pace. He pulls out a deadly looking dagger, with a sharp point and a triangular shaped blade, and sprints on and
INIGO: closing the gap, closer, closer and he's down the stairs and heading into a dining hall and
COUNT RUGEN: throwing the dagger
INIGO: trying like hell to get out of the way, but no, and it sticks deep into his stomach, and he hurtles back helplessly against the wall of the room, his eyes glazed, blood coming from his wound. The room is going white on him.
INIGO: . Sorry, Father . I tried . I tried.
COUNT RUGEN: looking across the room at Inigo. He stares at Inigo's face, and then touches his own cheeks, as memory comes.
RUGEN: You must be that little Spanish brat I taught a lesson to all those years ago. It's simply incredible. Have you been chasing me your whole life only to fail now? I think that's the worst thing I ever heard. How marvelous.
BUTTERCUP: shutting the door of the Honeymoon Suite, crossing quietly to the far wall where she sits at a table, opens a jeweled box, and takes out a very deadly looking dagger. She seems very much at peace as she touches the knife to her bosom.
WESTLEY: There's a shortage of perfect breasts in this world. It would be a pity to damage yours.
WESTLEY: lying on the bed. Yellin's sword is beside him. His voice sounds just fine, but he does not move. Buttercup leaps to the bed, covering him with kisses. Westley is helpless.
BUTTERCUP: Oh, Westley, darling. Westley, why won't you hold me?
WESTLEY: ( gently ) At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"
BUTTERCUP: At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"
WESTLEY: ( not so gently )
COUNT RUGEN: looking very much surprised.
RUGEN: Good heavens. Are you still trying to win?
RUGEN: You've got an overdeveloped sense of vengeance. It's going to get you into trouble some day.
THE COUNT: stepping back, going for the heart again.
INIGO: And as this blow comes he's trying to use the wall for support in forcing himself to his feet, and it's not a roaring success of an attempt, but he does at least make some progress, and again he manages to parry the thrust, as this time Rugen's sword runs through his right arm. Again, Inigo doesn't seem to mind, doesn't even feel it.
COUNT RUGEN: stepping back forj ust a moment, watching as Inigo continues to inch his way to his feet and then, just before the Count is about to strike again, Inigo manages a little flick of his own and Rugen hadn't expected it, and he jumps back, makes a little involuntary cry of surprise and
INIGO: slowly pushing away from the wall.
INIGO: ( all but audible ) Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father; prepare to
COUNT RUGEN: suddenly going into a fierce attack, striking with great power and precision for he is a master swordsman, and he forces Inigo easily back, drives him easily into the wall. But he does not penetrate Inigo's defense. None of the Count's blows get home. As the Count steps back a moment
INIGO: pushing slowly off from the wall again.
INIGO: ( a little louder ) Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to ( a little louder still ) Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to Stop saying that!
THE COUNT: And again he attacks, slashing with wondrous skill. But none of his blows get through and, slowly, Inigo, again moves
INIGO: ( a little louder still ) Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to Stop saying that!
RUGEN: Stop saying that!
COUNT RUGEN: retreating more quickly around the table. Inigo drives for the Count's left shoulder now, thrusts home where the Count had gotten him. Then another move and his blade enters the Count's right shoulder, the same spot Inigo was wounded.
INIGO: ( all he's got )
RUGEN: offer me money
INIGO: offer me money
RUGEN: power too promise me that
INIGO: power too promise me that
RUGEN: all that I have and more offer me everything I ask anything you want
INIGO: offer me everything I ask anything you want
RUGEN: anything you want
INIGO: ( roaring )
INIGO: and almost too fast for the eye to follow, the sword strikes one final time and
COUNT RUGEN: crying out in fear and panic as the sword hits home dead center and
RUGEN: lying dead. His skin is ashen and the blood still pours from the parallel cuts on his cheeks and his eyes are bulging wide, full of fear.
INIGO: staring at Rugen. And now Inigo does something we have never seen him do before: he smiles. HOLD FOR JUST A MOMENT on Inigo smiling, then
BUTTERCUP: Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?
WESTLEY: What hideous sin have you committed lately?
BUTTERCUP: I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
WESTLEY: It never happened.
BUTTERCUP: It never happened.
WESTLEY: It never happened.
BUTTERCUP: But it did. I was there. This old man said, "Man and wife."
WESTLEY: Did you say, "I do"?
BUTTERCUP: Well, no, we sort of skipped that Then you're not married if you didn't say it, you didn't do it wouldn't you agree, Your
WESTLEY: Then you're not married if you didn't say it, you didn't do it wouldn't you agree, Your
HUMPERDINCK: entering the room, staring at them. He pulls out his sword.
HUMPERDINCK: A technicality that will shortly be remedied. But first things first. To the death.
WESTLEY: ( a little pause ) To the pain.
HUMPERDINCK: ( about to charge, stops short ) I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
WESTLEY: I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced That may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me.
HUMPERDINCK: That may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me.
WESTLEY: lying there comfortably, his words quiet at first.
WESTLEY: It won't be the last. To the pain means the first thing you lose will be your feet, below the ankles, then your hands at the wrists, next your nose.
HUMPERDINCK: gripping his sword, watching.
HUMPERDINCK: and then my tongue, I suppose. I killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight.
WESTLEY: I wasn't finished the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right
HUMPERDINCK: ( takes step forward ) and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it
WESTLEY: Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why
HUMPERDINCK: And now he stops, and the look that was in his eyes at the wedding, that look of fear, is starting to return.
WESTLEY: so that every shriek of every child at seeing your hideousness will be yours to cherish every babe that weeps at your approach, every woman who cries out, "Dear God, what is that thing?" will echo in your perfect ears.
HUMPERDINCK: doing his best to hide the fear that keeps building inside
HUMPERDINCK: I think you're bluffing
WESTLEY: lying there, staring at him.
WESTLEY: It's possible, pig I might be bluffing it's conceivable, you miserable vomitous mass, that I'm only lying here because I lack the strength to stand then again, perhaps I have the strength after all.
HUMPERDINCK: staring, eyes wide.
WESTLEY: And now he is standing, sword in fighting position.
WESTLEY: ( slow and determined )
PRINCE HUMPERDINCK: and he's so panicked he doesn't know whether to pee or wind his watch. He throws his sword to the floor.
WESTLEY: ( to Humperdinck ) Have a seat.
WESTLEY: speaking to Buttercup as Humperdinck sits.
WESTLEY: Tie him up. Make it as tight as you like.
INIGO: entering, looking around.
INIGO: Where's Fezzik?
WESTLEY: I thought he was with you.
INIGO: In that case
WESTLEY: In that case
INIGO: ( to Buttercup ) Help him.
BUTTERCUP: Why does Westley need helping?
INIGO: Because he has no strength
HUMPERDINCK: and now be starts wrestling mightily with his bonds.
HUMPERDINCK: I knew it! I knew you were bluffing! I knew he was bluffing.
INIGO: ( staring at the Prince ) Shall I dispatch him for you?
WESTLEY: ( considers this, then ) Thank you, but no whatever happens to us, I want him to live a long life alone with his ( off-screen ) Inigo! Inigo, where are you?
FEZZIK: ( off-screen ) Inigo! Inigo, where are you?
FEZZIK: leading FOUR GREAT WHITE HORSES. He glances up, sees them on the balcony.
FEZZIK: Ah, there you are. Inigo, I saw the Prince's stables, and there they were, four white horses. And I thought, there are four of us, if we ever find the lad hello, lad so I took them with me, in case we ever bumped into each I guess we just did.
INIGO: FEZZIK, you did something right.
FEZZIK: Don't worry I won't let it go to my head.
INIGO: You know, it's very strange I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, I don't know what to do with the rest of my life.
WESTLEY: ( as Inigo gets him ready for his jump ) Have you ever considered piracy? You'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts.
GRANDFATHER: ( off-screen ) They rode to freedom. And as dawn arose, Westley and Buttercup knew they were safe. A wave of love swept over them. And as they reached for each other.
THE KID: What? What?
GRANDFATHER: No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.
THE KID: I don't mind so much.
GRANDFATHER: CUT TO:
GRANDFATHER: ( off-screen ) Since the invention of the kiss, there have been five kisses that were rated the most passionate, the most pure. This one left them all behind. The end.
GRANDFATHER: Now I think you ought to go to Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So
THE KID: ( standing, readying to leave ) Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So
GRANDFATHER: ( standing, readying to leave ) Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So
THE KID: The Old Man stops, turns.
THE KID: Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.
GRANDFATHER: ( a beat ) As you wish.
