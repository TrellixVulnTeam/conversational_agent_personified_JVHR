SENIOR BULLY: Hop, freshman toads. Hop! Move it, boys!
LINEBACKER: Man, you got big.
NOSE TACKLE: Worked out all summer. Rock hard, dude.
BRAD HAYS: Would you guys get a room?
CANDACE: Seniors only. What are you doing with a plastic spork?
DEREK: I don't want to bring back silverware
CANDACE: Derek, you're Earth Club Treasurer.
PATRICK: Boys, the prick punch is not a toy. I learned that in 'Nam back in '68. "Callahan," the sergeant said, "put down that prick punch and go kill some gooks."
MR. CALLAHAN: I heard you were going to be in my class. Are you proud being a senior taking freshman shop, Patty-Cakes?
PATRICK: My name is Patrick. You call me Patrick or you call me nothing.
MR. CALLAHAN: Okay. Nothing.
MR. CALLAHAN: Everyone open your safety guides. Nothing. why don't you read first?
PATRICK: Chapter 1. Surviving your fascist shop teacher, who needs to put kids down to feel big. Oh, wow. This is useful guys. We should read on.
BILL: Shhh. I'm Mr. Anderson. And thanks to Teach for America, I'm going to be your teacher for freshman English. This semester, we're going to be learning Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird. Genius book. Now, who wants to get out of the first pop quiz?
FRESHMAN GIRL: That's a great guess, but no, Shakespeare didn't write novels. Anybody else? The author was.
BILL: That's a great guess, but no, Shakespeare didn't write novels. Anybody else? The author was.
BILL: I'll give you a free "A" on anything but the final term paper if you get it right.
BILL: You should learn to participate.
CHARLIE: Thank you, sir, but if my English teacher is the only friend I make today, that would be sort of depressing.
BILL: Yeah. I could see that.
CHARLIE: Don't worry, Mr. Anderson. I'm okay.
PATRICK: ( to Mrs. Small ) I would happily not take shop.
SENIOR BULLY: Hey, Freshman Toad.
DEREK: Mmmm. This chicken paprikash is delicious, Mrs. Kelmeckis.
MOTHER: Thank you, Derek. It's Charlie's favorite. He was a little nervous about starting high school, so I made it.
FATHER: You feel a little silly being nervous now, huh, champ?
CHARLIE: Yes, sir. I sure do.
FATHER: I told you. Just give 'em a smile and be yourself. That's how you
CANDACE: "make friends in the real world."
FATHER: You're cruisin' for a bruisin'.
DEREK: Freshman year is tough, but you really find yourself.
FATHER: ( deep eye roll ) Thanks, Derek.
MOTHER: I think you could be a little nicer to I'm sorry. The kid's a pussy. I can't stand him.
FATHER: I'm sorry. The kid's a pussy. I can't stand him.
DEREK: ( waving from car ) I hope you love the mix I made. The cover is hand-painted.
CANDACE: Charlie, do you want this?
CHARLIE: Are you sure?
CANDACE: He gives me one every week.
PATRICK: Come on Devils! Woooooo!
PATRICK: Suck it, virginity pledges!
CHARLIE: Hey. Patrick.
PATRICK: Hey! You're in my shop class, right? How's your clock coming?
CHARLIE: My dad's building it.
PATRICK: Yeah. Mine looks like a boat. You want to sit over here, or are you waiting for your friends?
CHARLIE: No. I'll sit if that's okay.
PATRICK: Thanks for not calling me "Nothing" by the way. It's an endless nightmare. And these assholes actually think they're being original.
CHARLIE: So, uh. you like football?
PATRICK: Love it.
CHARLIE: Then, maybe you know my broth
PATRICK: Hey, Sam.
SAM: Question. Could the bathrooms here be more disgusting?
PATRICK: Yes, they call it the men's room.
SAM: Well, I finally got hold of Bob.
PATRICK: Party tonight?
SAM: No. He's still trying to shag that waitress from the Olive Garden.
PATRICK: He's never tossing that salad.
SAM: ( about Charlie ) Patrick. who's this?
PATRICK: This is.
CHARLIE: Uh. Charlie. Kelmeckis.
PATRICK: Kelmeckis! No shit! Your sister dates Pony Tail Derek, doesn't she?
CHARLIE: Is that what they call him?
SAM: Awww. Leave Pony Tail Derek alone. You put the "ass" in "class," Patrick.
PATRICK: I try, Sam. I try.
SAM: It's nice to meet you, Charlie. I'm Sam.
PATRICK: So, what's the plan, Sam? You want to go to Mary Elizabeth's house?
SAM: Can't. She got caught watering down her parent's brandy with iced tea. Let's just go to Kings.
PATRICK: ( turns to Charlie ) Hey. we're going to Kings after the game if you want to come.
SAM: Do you have a favorite band?
CHARLIE: I think The Smiths are my favorite.
SAM: Are you kidding!? I love The Smiths! The best breakup band ever. What's your favorite song?
CHARLIE: Asleep. It's from Louder Than Bombs. I heard it on Pony Tail Derek's mix tape.
PATRICK: That works on so many levels.
CHARLIE: I could make a copy for you.
SAM: Thanks. What about Eide's? You love Eide's, right?
CHARLIE: ( never heard of it ) Yeah. They're great.
PATRICK: Not a band, Charlie.
SAM: It's an old record store downtown.
PATRICK: I used to be popular before Sam got me some good music. So, watch out, Charlie. She'll ruin your life forever.
CHARLIE: That's okay.
PATRICK: Let it go! Jesus! It's an old joke! It's over!
SAM: So, Charlie. what are you going to do when you get out of here?
CHARLIE: My Aunt Helen said I should be a writer, but I don't know what I'd write about.
SAM: You could write about us.
PATRICK: Yeah. Call it Slut and The Falcon. Make us solve crimes.
CHARLIE: You guys look happy together. How long have you been boyfriend and girlfriend? He's my step-brother. My mom finally left my worthless dad and married his nice dad 3 years ago.
SAM: He's my step-brother. My mom finally left my worthless dad and married his nice dad 3 years ago.
PATRICK: But Sam's not bitter. Make no mistake.
SAM: Absolutely. I'm not a bulimic. I'm a They laugh at their inside joke. Charlie has no idea what's so funny.
CHARLIE: I'm sorry. I don't know what that means.
PATRICK: She just really believes in bulimia.
SAM: ( cracking up ) I love bulimia.
PATRICK: Thanks for paying, Charlie.
CHARLIE: ( so eager ) No problem. Thanks for the ride. Hey. maybe I'll see you around in school?
SAM: ( distracted - to Patrick ) God, would you turn that down? You're going to make us deaf. Bye, Charlie.
PATRICK: Bye, Charlie.
CHARLIE: Okay. Bye.
DEREK: There's nothing I can do
CANDACE: Do you always want to be a mama's boy?
DEREK: I am not a mama's boy
CANDACE: Yes! You are! Every time I go to your Shhh. Shut u
DEREK: Shhh. Shut u
CANDACE: your mom says, "Don't go to Columbia with Candace. Go to Pitt, Derek. Mommy needs you to stay at home because she can't drive herself." She's only 51.
DEREK: SHUT UP, CANDACE!
CANDACE: And you just stand there like a little bitch dog.
LITTLE CANDACE: Welcome home, Aunt Helen!
AUNT HELEN: Oh. Look at you all, dressed so nice.
CHARLIE: What are you doing?
CANDACE: Look, I egged him on. You saw it. He's never hit me before. I promise he'll never hit me again.
CHARLIE: Like Aunt Helen's boyfriends?
CANDACE: Charlie. this is Pony Tail Derek. I can handle him. Will you trust me? Please, don't tell mom and dad.
SAM: Oh, my God. They're playing good music.
PATRICK: Holy shit. They are! They're playing good music!
SAM: ( total mischief ) Living room routine?
PATRICK: Living room routine!
SAM: God, it's freezing.
PATRICK: But you wore that toasty costume. It's not like you're trying too hard to be Piss off, Tennessee Tuxedo.
SAM: Piss off, Tennessee Tuxedo.
CHARLIE: Are you sure it's okay that I come?
SAM: Of course. Just remember, Charlie. Bob's not paranoid.
PATRICK: "He's sensitive."
BOB: Sam. that waitress from the Olive Garden is a tease. Will you marry me?
SAM: Only if I have Patrick's blessing.
BOB: You're a hopeless stoner who attends the culinary institute. So, I'm going to have to say "no" on that one, but nice try. Charlie?
PATRICK: You're a hopeless stoner who attends the culinary institute. So, I'm going to have to say "no" on that one, but nice try. Charlie?
BOB: 35 INT. BOB'S BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER 35 The music blasts. Charlie's eyes are our guide. As they walk through the crowd, you can smell it. Stale beer and cigarette smoke. High school parties. The room is packed
PATRICK: Charlie. this is a party.
MARY ELIZABETH: Patrick, you're such a dick.
PATRICK: Where the hell did you go?
MARY ELIZABETH: The dance was a little boring, don't you You're so selfish. We looked everywhere for you. You could have told someone.
PATRICK: You're so selfish. We looked everywhere for you. You could have told someone.
MARY ELIZABETH: Cry me a river.
PATRICK: How is it that you got meaner since
MARY ELIZABETH: Just lucky I guess.
PATRICK: I think you're doing something wrong.
MARY ELIZABETH: Or something very right.
CHARLIE: Is that Brad Hays?
ALICE: Yeah. He comes here sometimes.
CHARLIE: But he's a popular kid.
MARY ELIZABETH: ( offended ) Then, what are we?
BOB: Charlie, you look like you could use a Thank you. I was so hungry at the dance. I was going to go to King's, but I didn't really have any time. Thanks.
CHARLIE: Thank you. I was so hungry at the dance. I was going to go to King's, but I didn't really have any time. Thanks.
CHARLIE: Have you guys felt this carpet? This carpet feels so darn good.
MARY ELIZABETH: ( laughing ) Charlie, what do you think about high High school? Bullshit. The cafeteria is called the Nutrition Center. And people wear their letter jackets even when it's 98 degrees out. And why do they give out letters for marching band? That's not a sport, and we all know it.
CHARLIE: High school? Bullshit. The cafeteria is called the Nutrition Center. And people wear their letter jackets even when it's 98 degrees out. And why do they give out letters for marching band? That's not a sport, and we all know it.
MARY ELIZABETH: This kid is crazy.
CHARLIE: And Mary Elizabeth, I think you're really going to regret that haircut when you look back at old photographs. I'm really sorry. That sounded like a compliment in my head.
MARY ELIZABETH: Oh, my God!
ALICE: Well, it's kind of true.
MARY ELIZABETH: Shut up!
SAM: Bob, did you get him stoned?
BOB: Come on, Sam. He likes it. Just look at How do you feel, Charlie?
SAM: How do you feel, Charlie?
CHARLIE: I just really want a milkshake.
CHARLIE: Sam, you have such pretty brown eyes, the kind of pretty that deserves to make a big deal about itself. You know what I Okay, Charlie. Let me make the milkshake.
SAM: Okay, Charlie. Let me make the milkshake.
CHARLIE: What a great word. Milkshake. It's like when you say your name over and over again in the mirror, and after awhile, it sounds crazy.
SAM: I'm guessing you've never been high Me? No. My best friend Michael. His dad was a big drinker. So, he hated all that stuff. Parties, too.
CHARLIE: Me? No. My best friend Michael. His dad was a big drinker. So, he hated all that stuff. Parties, too.
SAM: Well, where is Michael tonight?
CHARLIE: Oh, he shot himself last May.
SAM: It's up the stairs.
CHARLIE: Charlie wanders off. Sam watches him go.
CHARLIE: Charlie. Charlie. Weird.
PATRICK: BRAD HAYS ( nervous )
BRAD HAYS: ( nervous ) Who is that kid?
PATRICK: Relax. Relax. He's a friend of mine. Stay here.
CHARLIE: I didn't see anything.
PATRICK: I know you saw something, but it's okay.
CHARLIE: "Like a cake." That's what Bob said. And how you can't have 3 on a match because they would find us. And everyone laughed, but I don't know what's funny.
PATRICK: Okay, Charlie, listen. I need you to promise that you're not going to say anything to anyone about me and Brad. This has to be our little secret.
CHARLIE: Our little secret. Agreed.
PATRICK: Thank you. We'll talk later.
CHARLIE: I look forward to that big talk.
CHARLIE: Isn't this the best milkshake, Alice? It's even better than the first one.
SAM: ( barely audible whisper ) I need to talk to you. Charlie just told me that his best friend shot himself. I don't think he has any friends.
PATRICK: Everyone. Raise your glasses to Charlie.
CHARLIE: What did I do?
PATRICK: You didn't do anything. We just want to toast our new friend. You see things. And you understand. You're a wallflower.
CHARLIE: Well, we didn't think there were any cool people left to meet. So, everyone.
PATRICK: Well, we didn't think there were any cool people left to meet. So, everyone.
SAM: Welcome to the island of misfit toys.
SAM: My God. What is this song!?
PATRICK: Right? I have no idea.
SAM: ( to Charlie ) Have you heard it before?
CHARLIE: ( light bulb ) Wait! Let's go through the tunnel!
SAM: ( light bulb ) Wait! Let's go through the tunnel!
PATRICK: Sam, it's freezing.
SAM: Patrick, it's the perfect song!
PATRICK: No. Mama Patrick says no.
SAM: Patrick, it's Sam. It's Sam talking to you, I'm begging you to drive me
PATRICK: ( laughing ) Alright! I concede!
CHARLIE: What is she doing?
PATRICK: Don't worry. She does it all the time.
SAM: Turn it up!
PATRICK: You got it, your highness.
THE TUNNEL: We go behind the truck. Rising as Sam puts her arms in the air. The image moves to Charlie's point of view, rising from Sam's feet up her shivering legs. Past the band-aid on her right knee. To Sam's face as she looks down. Into the camera. Right at us. For we are now. Charlie, looking up at Sam, so in love with this free-spirit. So happy to have friends. Happy to be alive. Charlie gets this look on his face. Patrick notices and smiles.
CHARLIE: I feel infinite.
AIR SUPPLY: I'm lying alone with my head on the phone, thinking of you 'til it hurts.
CHARLIE: When he was a junior, Patrick started seeing Brad on the weekends in secret. I guess it was hard, too, because Brad had to get drunk every time they fooled
PATRICK: Whatever happened to Fae Wray? That delicate, satin draped frame? As it clung to her thigh, how I started to cry 'cause I wanted to be dressed just the same.
ALICE: It's gorgeous, Craig. What did you use?
CRAIG: Color film, but black and white paper for the printing. My professor gave me an "A," but for the wrong reasons. Most of them are idiots. You'll see what I mean when you get to college. How were your SAT's by the way?
ALICE: ( worried ) 1150. I think I'll get into NYU.
CRAIG: Yeah, I hope so.
MARY ELIZABETH: ( cruel to Alice ) 1490. Harvard. Face!
CHARLIE: Hey. Are you okay?
SAM: Yeah. Yeah. But I got my SAT results back. Oops.
CHARLIE: You can take them again.
SAM: Yeah, it's just if I'm going to Penn State main campus, I have to do much better. I wish I would have studied freshman year. I was a bit of a mess.
CHARLIE: I'll help you study for the next one.
SAM: Will you?
CHARLIE: Yeah, of course.
SAM: Thanks, Charlie.
CHARLIE: Just a mix tape. No big deal. My parents have a pretty good stereo. It's all about that night in the tunnel. I couldn't find that song we were listening to, but I'm still searching for it, so
SAM: It's okay. These are great. You have really good taste, Charlie.
CHARLIE: Yeah. Way better than me as a freshman. I used to listen to the worst top 40.
SAM: Yeah. Way better than me as a freshman. I used to listen to the worst top 40.
CHARLIE: Yeah, I did. But then I heard this old song. Pearly Dew Drops Drop. And I thought someday I would be at a party in college or something. And I'd look up and see this person across the room. And from that moment, I'd know everything was going to be okay. You know what I mean?
SAM: Yeah, I did. But then I heard this old song. Pearly Dew Drops Drop. And I thought someday I would be at a party in college or something. And I'd look up and see this person across the room. And from that moment, I'd know everything was going to be okay. You know what I mean?
CHARLIE: ( devastated in love )
ALICE: So, what do you think?
PATRICK: I don't know.
ALICE: I hope it works out. Craig would be a big step up from her last boyfriend.
MARY ELIZABETH: No, shit. Who could forget Mr. Car Wash I just hope she stops playing dumb with these guys. I keep telling her. don't make yourself small. You can't save
PATRICK: I just hope she stops playing dumb with these guys. I keep telling her. don't make yourself small. You can't save
CRAIG: Man, your mix is morbidly sad, kid. How about something a little more upbeat?
CHARLIE: Don't you write poetry, Craig?
ALICE: Don't you write poetry, Craig?
CRAIG: No. Poetry writes me. You know?
BILL: Wow. That was fast. You want another
CHARLIE: Mr. Anderson. can I ask you something?
BILL: Why do nice people choose the wrong people to date?
CHARLIE: Why do nice people choose the wrong people to date?
BILL: Are we talking about anyone specific?
CHARLIE: Can we make them know they deserve more?
BILL: We can try.
SAM: Hey, Charlie.
CHARLIE: Hey, Sam. I didn't see you come in. You want to work on probabilities and
CHARLIE: Hey, dad. Can I have 30 dollars?
FATHER: ( old joke ) 20 dollars? What do you want 10 dollars Sam is doing secret santa. It's her favorite thing in the world. Please.
CHARLIE: Sam is doing secret santa. It's her favorite thing in the world. Please.
FATHER: Have fun.
CHARLIE: 60 INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 60
BILL: Charlie. this was my favorite book growing up. This is my copy, but I want you to have it.
CHARLIE: Have a great Christmas break.
BILL: Have a great Christmas break.
CHARLIE: You too, Mr. Anderson.
MR. CALLAHAN: Terrible stain.
PATRICK: If you fail me, you get me next semester.
PATRICK: Woo! C Minus! It's over! It's over! Ladies and gentlemen, I am below average!
SAM: Below average!
SAM: Hey, guys. 1210.
SAM: No more applications! No more SAT's! Thank you, Charlie!
MARY ELIZABETH: Multiple pairs of blue jeans. Wow. This is a really tough one, but I'm going to have to guess. Alice.
PATRICK: MARY ELIZABETH
MARY ELIZABETH: I'm so touched.
CHARLIE: Where's Craig?
SAM: He went home to Connecticut. He'll be back for New Year's Eve.
CHARLIE: I'm sorry we won't be seeing him tonight.
SAM: Alright, big brother by 3 weeks. Who's your secret santa?
PATRICK: I'll tell you, Sam. This one's tough. I have received a harmonica, a magnetic poetry set, a book about Harvey Milk, and a mix with the song "Asleep" on it.
SAM: Alright, Charlie. it's your turn.
CHARLIE: Okay. Uh, I have received socks, pants, a shirt, and a belt. I was ordered to wear them all tonight. So, I'm guessing my secret santa is Mary Elizabeth.
PATRICK: Huh. Now, why do you say that?
CHARLIE: I don't know. She bosses people around
MARY ELIZABETH: What the hell is wrong with you?
CHARLIE: Well, you'll be surprised to know that your secret santa is actually. me.
PATRICK: Well, you'll be surprised to know that your secret santa is actually. me.
CHARLIE: You got me clothes? Why?
PATRICK: Because all the great writers used to wear great suits. Your last present is on a towel rack in the bathroom. Delve into our facilities. Emerge a star.
CHARLIE: Can you hand these out while I'm gone?
MARY ELIZABETH: Wait a second. There's only secret santa presents. There are rules, Charlie.
PATRICK: Mary Elizabeth, why are you trying to eat Christmas? Hand them out, Sam.
ALICE: "Alice, I know you'll get into NYU."
MARY ELIZABETH: 40 dollars. "To print Punk Rocky in color next time."
BOB: He knows me. He really knows me.
SAM: Come on out, Charlie.
PATRICK: Yeah! What a display of man I have ever
CHARLIE: Where are we going?
SAM: It's a surprise.
CHARLIE: Is this your room? It's so cool.
SAM: Sam points to a green box with a red ribbon on her desk.
CHARLIE: You got me a present?
SAM: With all that help on my Penn State application? Of course I did. Open it.
CHARLIE: I don't know what to say.
SAM: You don't have to say anything.
CHARLIE: That's okay. I'm just sorry you have to go back and visit your dad.
SAM: I'm in such a great mood, I don't think even he could ruin it. I feel like I'm finally doing good.
CHARLIE: You are.
SAM: Me? What about you? When I met you, you were this scared freshman. And look at you in that suit. You're like a sexy English school boy. I saw Mary Elizabeth checking you out.
CHARLIE: ( innocent laugh ) Innocent. Worst kind of guys. Never see you coming. And parents love you. That's like. extra danger.
SAM: Innocent. Worst kind of guys. Never see you coming. And parents love you. That's like. extra danger.
CHARLIE: Well, it hasn't worked so far.
SAM: Come on. You've never had a girlfriend? Not even a 2nd grade valentine?
CHARLIE: No. What about you?
SAM: Have I ever kissed a girl?
CHARLIE: ( laughs ) No! Your first kiss.
SAM: My first kiss? I was 11. His name was Robert. He would come over to the house all the time.
CHARLIE: Was he your first boyfriend?
SAM: He was my dad's boss.
CHARLIE: It's true. You can do it.
SAM: My Aunt. she had that same thing done to her, too. And she turned her life She must have been great.
CHARLIE: My Aunt. she had that same thing done to her, too. And she turned her life She must have been great.
SAM: She must have been great.
CHARLIE: She was my favorite person in the world. until now.
SAM: Charlie, I know that you know I like Craig. But I want to forget that for a minute. Okay? I just want to make sure that the first person who kisses you loves you. Okay?
CHARLIE: I love you, too.
GANG: "Merry Christmas!" "Good luck at your dad's!" "See you at New Year's!"
CHARLIE: Have a good time at your mom's.
PATRICK: Thanks. And Charlie. since you were born on Christmas Eve, I figure you don't get a lot of birthday presents. So, I thought you should have my clock. From the heart.
CHARLIE: Thank you, Patrick.
PATRICK: I love you guys!
FATHER: Hey! Look who's here!
CHRIS: Come here, little sister.
CANDACE: Hey, Chris.
CHRIS: Ma, you look so thin!

CHARLIE: How are you liking school?
CHRIS: Not bad. I'm no brainiac like you or Candace. But I'm doing okay.
CHARLIE: Okay? You're playing in a Bowl Game.
CHRIS: How are you feeling, Charlie?
CHARLIE: You know what I mean. Is it bad tonight?
CHRIS: You know what I mean. Is it bad tonight?
CHARLIE: I'm not picturing things anymore. And when I do, I can just shut it off.
CHRIS: I'm not picturing things anymore. And when I do, I can just shut it off.
CHARLIE: I'm not picturing things anymore. And when I do, I can just shut it off.
CHRIS: ( relieved )
CHARLIE: Yeah. Especially Sam. I'm going to ask her out at New Years. I think the time is right now.
CHARLIE: How long does this take to work?
SAM: Shoveling snow, huh?
CHARLIE: I have to get this driveway clean. Then, I have to congratulate you for being happy because you deserve it.
SAM: You said that an hour ago.
CHARLIE: Was that tonight? God. I was looking at this tree, but it was a dragon, and then
SAM: Okay, Charlie. Don't freak out. Just give me the shovel. Calm down. Look up.
CHARLIE: Sam, you ever think that if people knew how crazy you really were, no one would ever talk to you?
SAM: All the time. So, you want to put on these glasses? They'll protect you.

AUNT HELEN: It'll be our little secret, all right?
PATRICK: 7-6-5-4-3-2-1. Happy New Year!
POLICEMAN: Did your older friends pressure you?
CHARLIE: No one pressured me into anything. I would never do drugs, officer. Never.
POLICEMAN: Then, how did you happen to be passed out on the ground at 6 in the morning?
CHARLIE: Well, um. I was really tired, and uh. I was feeling feverish. So, I went outside for a walk, just to get some cold air. And I started seeing things. So, I passed out.
MOTHER: ( worried ) You're seeing things again, Charlie?
CHARLIE: ( oops ) Not, uh. Not really.
CHARLIE: It was a Christmas present.
CHARLIE: Did you have fun on your break?
BILL: More fun than you're going to have today,
MARY ELIZABETH: Well what are we supposed to do? We're going on in 10 minutes!
CHARLIE: But they said in health class
BRAD HAYS: They say that about LSD to scare you.
CHARLIE: Are you sure?
BRAD HAYS: Charlie, you're fine, man.
MARY ELIZABETH: Guys, we have an emergency. Craig flaked out on us again. I need a Rocky. Brad?
BRAD HAYS: ( scared ) No way. There are people out here.
MARY ELIZABETH: Charlie. take off your clothes.
SAM: ( as Janet ) So if anything grows while you pose. I'll oil you up and drop you down. And that's just one small fraction of the main attraction. You need a friendly hand. And I need action!
CHARLIE: Maybe I could join the cast as an alternate or something?
MARY ELIZABETH: We're filled up now, but they'll need people after we leave for college. I could put in a good word for you.
CHARLIE: That'd be great. Thanks.
MARY ELIZABETH: Charlie. have you heard of the Sadie Hawkins dance?
CHARLIE: The one where the girl asks the guy.
MARY ELIZABETH: Yeah. Well, obviously, it's completely stupid and sexist. It's like, "Hey, thanks for the crumb." And normally, I'd just blow it off because school dances suck torture. But, you know, it's my last year, and. would you maybe want to go with me?
CHARLIE: You want to go with me?
MARY ELIZABETH: I'm sick of macho guys. And you looked really cute in your costume. So, what do you say?
MOTHER: You must be Mary Elizabeth. It's so good to meet you.
MARY ELIZABETH: You, too, Mrs. Kelmeckis.
FATHER: ( shit eating grin ) Charlie tells me you're a Buddhist.
FATHER: OK, a little closer together. That looks nice. Buddhist, I need you to smile a little bit more. There you go. Nice.
CHARLIE: Are you having a good time?
SAM: Not really. How about you?
CHARLIE: I don't know. This is my first date, so I don't know what to compare it to.
SAM: Don't worry. You're doing fine.
CHARLIE: I'm sorry Craig didn't come.
SAM: Yeah. He said he didn't want to go to some stupid high school dance. Can't say I blame him.
CHARLIE: I don't know. If you like it, he should Thanks, Charlie. Have a beautiful first date. You deserve it.
SAM: Thanks, Charlie. Have a beautiful first date. You deserve it.
CHARLIE: I'll try not to make you too jealous.
MARY ELIZABETH: Mmmm. Now, let it breathe.
CHARLIE: This is sure a nice house.
MARY ELIZABETH: Mary Elizabeth drops the needle on a vinyl LP. A Doo Wop make-out classic begins to play. She dances over to Charlie.
CHARLIE: This merlot is really fancy.
MARY ELIZABETH: Yeah. My dad collects wine, but he doesn't drink. That's weird, isn't it?
CHARLIE: I guess. Where are your parents?
MARY ELIZABETH: Their club is hosting a cotillion or something racist. They'll be gone all
CHARLIE: That's sure a nice fire.
MARY ELIZABETH: Yeah. After I'm done being a lobbyist, I want to move to a house like this in Cape Cod. That sounds nice, doesn't it?
CHARLIE: She reaches out and touches his chest.
MARY ELIZABETH: Your heart is beating really fast.
CHARLIE: Is it?
MARY ELIZABETH: Here, feel.
CHARLIE: MARY ELIZABETH
MARY ELIZABETH: Do you like me?
CHARLIE: MARY ELIZABETH
MARY ELIZABETH: You know what I mean.
CHARLIE: I think so.
MARY ELIZABETH: Don't be nervous.
MARY ELIZABETH: She gives him one last kiss. Content, she lays down on his lap. Peaceful.
CHARLIE: MARY ELIZABETH

PATRICK: Really? I thought your brother would have told you. It's a classic.
CHARLIE: So, Lily comes here with this guy Parker. And this was going to be the night they were going to lose their virginity. So, she did it really proper. She packed a picnic. Stole a bottle of wine. Everything was perfect, and they're just about to 'do it' when they realize they forgot the condoms. So, what do you think happened?

CHARLIE: Fine! Okay. Your turn.
PATRICK: Yeah, I've got one. Well, there was this one guy. Queer as a 3 dollar bill. Guy's father didn't know about his son. So, he comes down into the basement one night when he's supposed to be out of town. Catches his son with another boy. So, he starts beating him. But not like the slap kind. Like the real kind. And the boyfriend says, "Stop. You're killing him." And the son just yells "Get out." And eventually the boyfriend just did.
CHARLIE: I don't know.
PATRICK: Forget it. I'm free now, right? I could meet the love of my life any second now. Things will be different now, and that's good. I just need to meet a good guy.
CHARLIE: Patrick looks at him. Charlie has never seen him so vulnerable. After a beat. Patrick kisses Charlie on the mouth. Unsure of what to do, Charlie lets it happen. His eyes open the whole time. A moment, then Patrick looks at Charlie. He collapses into his chest.
PATRICK: I'm sorry.
CHARLIE: It's alright.
PATRICK: ( reading ) "We will require you to take our summer session at the main campus immediately following your high school graduation." ( off Charlie's look ) She got in, Charlie.
CHARLIE: Especially because ever since I blacked out in the cafeteria, it's been getting worse. And I can't turn it off this

SAM: Well, what did you want?
CHARLIE: I just want you to be happy.
SAM: Don't you get it, Charlie? I can't feel that. It's really sweet and everything, but you can't just sit there and put everybody's lives ahead of yours and think that counts as love. I don't want to be somebody's crush. I want people to like the real me.
