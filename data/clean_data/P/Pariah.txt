ALIKE: You know I gotta go. I'ma get in Lemme dance with shortie first, then I'll be ready.
LAURA: Lemme dance with shortie first, then I'll be ready.
ALIKE: Laura spins the short haired on the dance floor and the pair continue their wobbling, uneven groove. Alike endures several moments of invisibility as a sea of women, both "feminine" and "butch" push past her without a second glance. Alike tugs at Laura's jersey. Laura, happily tangled in her dance partner's embrace rolls her eyes.
LAURA: Stop pulling on my clothes!
ALIKE: How many numbers you get? One?

ALIKE: It's old.
AUDREY: Compliments your figure. I saw something just like it on sale, maybe we could go shopping
ALIKE: Audrey stiffens and pulls her robe tighter. Vinegar replaces honey in her demeanor as the warmth drains out of her voice.
AUDREY: I really don't care for that young lady you run around with anyway.
ALIKE: Yeah, okay!
AUDREY: And tie your head up.
ALIKE: I don't have on make-up.

AUDREY: Watch your tone. Well, it's your skin.
ALIKE: Yes, mom.
MATH TEACHER: As promised, I will be grading these on a curve.
ALIKE: MRS. ALVARADO, a middle aged Californian ex-hippie type reclines with her feet on her desk, munching on celery sticks and sunflower seed paste. Her small desk radio plays alternative rock. Sun beams into the empty classroom and Alike squints as she yanks the headphones out of her ears and pulls up a chair next to her desk.
MRS. ALVARADO: Whaddja bring me?
ALIKE: Nothin' you can eat.
MRS. ALVARADO: You shouldn't be eatin' that crap, I know.
ALIKE: ( over a mouthful of pizza ) I know.

ALIKE: MRS. ALVARADO
MRS. ALVARADO: They're lovely. Of course your descriptiveness and use of alliteration is beautiful and all, you know that. But.I don't know. Is it your best? No.
ALIKE: I thought it was good.
MRS. ALVARADO: It's good. Not great. I believe you can go deeper.
MRS. ALVARADO: I believe you can go deeper.

MRS. SINGLETARY: The youngest one.
AUDREY: No she's the oldest one.
MRS. SINGLETARY: Oh, the other one. Okay.
AUDREY: What, you think it's too young?
MRS. SINGLETARY: No, no. For whatever reason the youngest one popped in my mind first. But I think it should be fine. It's really cute.
AUDREY: Thank you.
MRS. SINGLETARY: It'll compliment her figure.
AUDREY: Now see that's what I thought. But Lee doesn't like anything I pick out for her anymore.
MRS. SINGLETARY: Girl, please. My oldest, 17 going on 27 mind you, banned me from buying her any more clothes. We have two completely different tastes. I just give her gift cards now and trust me, we're both happier for it. Is it her birthday?

SHARONDA: I don't see why we can't just watch TV like usual.
SHARONDA: Quit it!
ALIKE: Shut up.
SHARONDA: You don't tell me what to do!
AUDREY: The phone rings and Arthur beats a path to bedroom to get it. Audrey wilts.
ARTHUR: I'm expecting a call. This is your father's night off.
AUDREY: This is your father's night off.
SHARONDA: Homecoming got moved this year. It's gonna be in September instead of October.

AUDREY: Oooh, I see. Lee, who are you going with?
ALIKE: Umm. I'm not going.
AUDREY: Not going? This is your junior year. How can you not go?
ARTHUR: Leave her alone Audrey, if doesn't want to go, she doesn't have to go.
AUDREY: But it's her junior year, she's not gonna have any memories.
ARTHUR: I don't like all those boys buzzing around my daughters anyway.
SHARONDA: Nobody buzzes around Alike.
ARTHUR: That's right and it better stay that way. Matter of fact, I don't know if I'ma let you go.
SHARONDA: Alike smirks and takes her plate to the sink. Arthur jabs her on the arm as she walks by. Audrey tears into a dinner roll shooting daggers at anyone who dares to make eye contact.
