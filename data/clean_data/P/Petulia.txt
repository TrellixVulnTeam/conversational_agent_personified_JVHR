PETULIA: Written by Larry Marcus
NIGHT: The story begins in this grubby alley, where two extra large ambulances screech to a stop beside a loading platform. Onlookers gather in the alley entrance to see how many people died; nobody died, the backdoors of the ambulances are opened by attendants, and six perfectly fine victims of perfectly terrible automobile accidents are lifted into wheelchairs. The cripples are beautifully dressed, the men in tuxedos, the women in splendid evening dresses. One of the women wears a neck brace which forces her always to look skyward, so she cantt see the beautiful orchid corsage pinned to her bosom. Quickly, attendants roll the wheelchairs past all the stacks of fruit and vegetables on the loading platform, past great bales of laundry, past whatever horrors one finds behind the warm, smiling face of a hotel. Watch- men, pastry cooks, valets are watching the rush of the wheelchairs without much interest. Then doors swing open, and we are in the tram It of the grand ballroom.
2 CONTINUED: It's not easy for Petulia to keep an eye on Archie; gasping faces get in the ways hunks of twisting bodies get in the way, and the dance won't end. The music stops for a second, everyone sags and thinks, "Thank God it's over," but instantly the music begins again and everyone good naturedly swears, "Those crazy kids are trying to kill us," and meanwhile Petulia sees that Archie has reached the place where you get your MED. ARCHIE He is searching through his pockets for the ticket that will let him reclaim his coat. All the coats are in an incredible piles and in the semi-hysterical care of a debutante attendant.

MED. ARCHIE: He is searching through his pockets for the ticket that will let him reclaim his coat. All the coats are in an incredible piles and in the semi-hysterical care of a debutante attendant.
PETULIA: You're an official host. She nods to the ribbon and cardboard which along with 'Official Host' says Dr. A. Bollen. Archie takes the ribbon off, as though to pin it on Petulia.
PETULIA: Careful. Can you tell I'm not wearing a brassiere?
ARCHIE: Don't think about it. It will only excite you. Archie finally finds the ticket for his coat, which the attendant now tries to find. On through this Petulia 2 CONTINUED That's my husband over there,

PETULIA: I've been married six months and I've never had an affair,
ARCHIE: It can happen
PETULIA: Don't take it so bloody well. I've just turned you down. He's looking at us. My husband,
MR, DANNER: I hope you win the car, sir, Mrs. Danner is charmed by her husband's generosity. She simply adores the man. David is busy not watching Archie and Petulia,
PETULIA'S VOICE: Isn't he gorgeous? He's a naval architect. It really zings when you say it. "My husband David is a naval architect." Actually, we're starving. You wouldn't want to buy a sixty foot sloop? David's "Momma"` and "Poppa' keep us. Look how disgusted Poppa is. He hates this sort of thing.
L: 2 CONTINUED ARCHIEIS VOICE Poppa is too sensitive.
2 CONTINUED: ARCHIEIS VOICE Poppa is too sensitive.
ARCHIEIS VOICE: Poppa is too sensitive.
PETULIA'S VOICE: Sensitive, my ass. He's bored. Highway safety's so blah. Also, he hates amateurs. Give him something he can sink his teeth into - "Rheumatoid Arthritis" Â® "Muscular Dystrophy"' -m and he's the best there is. A real pro. A little lame girl with a ribbon in her hair and a crutch under her arm, and Poppa can set the world on fire. He's really slumming tonight.
BARNEY'S VOICE: Hello, Archie.
WILMA: Everybody came late.
ARCHIE: I came early. G'bye Wilma. G'bye DEBUTANTE ATTENDANT Could you describe the coat?
DEBUTANTE ATTENDANT: Could you describe the coat?
ARCHIE: A. coat. A raincoat. Sleeves. Barney has begun to snap his fingers and move his shoulders, becoming part of "The Scene", about which Wilma couldn't care less.

WI LMA: Alright, then. I won't tell you who I bumped into last week
ARCHIE: buying a well larded rib roast.
WILMA: Smarty. Have you seen what she's done to her hair?
ARCHIE: Wild, huh?
WILMA: I said, "Polo, for heaven's sake, you look like a teenager." Archie doesn't seem too interested and, besides, all this is said while Wilma continues to look at Petulia.
Â¢: Your Mike's getting so fat. Is that much weight good for a boy his age?
WILMA: Your Mike's getting so fat. Is that much weight good for a boy his age?
ARCHIE: ( SHRUGGING ) If it's alright for a rib roast
WILMA: Barney suddenly forgets the music to rescue his Vicuna coat which the debutante is smothering under other coats as she finally finds Archie's.
W ILMA: ( to Petulia ) I don't believe we've met.
PETULIA: Screw you, Wilma.
ARCHIE: Now you've met.
B: 2 CONTINUED Wilma moves off with Barney. Archie can't spend one more second with his coat. He simply puts it on, and turns to leave, walking toward the door.

PETULIA: My name is Petulia,

PETULIA: He turns, almost at the door.
PETULIA: Say something warm.
ARCHIE: Like what?
PETULIA: I mean it There is something goofily desperate in her voice that stops him. He looks at her for awhile.
ARCHIE: Your hair, It gleams.
PETULIA: ( DISAPPOINTED ) Oh, Archie.

PETULIA: I'll get my purse. But in turning to do so she sees David, then the spinning car, the door prize.
PETULIA: I've been told that I'll be the one to draw the winning ticket. I'm always picked for things like that. I radiate incorruptibility. Money can't buy me. She shakes her head, thoughtfully. During all this the door- man has been busily opening and closing the door for them as they keep changing their mind.

PETULIA: It feels so super. Suddenly, all that love.
ARCHIE'S VOICE: Well, stay then.
PETULIA: Archie, why do you play this dumb game? This crappy pretense at resisting the beautiful lady? You're bloody lucky I'm even talking to you. How many kids do you have besides fat Mike?
ARCHIE: Actually, only one besides Mike.
PETULIA: Actually, only one besides Mike.
ARCHIE: Actually, only one besides Mike.
PETULIA: Meet you outside.
PETULIA: ( to cabbie ) You mustn't take it personal. ( she indicates the "No Cabs" sign ) Lucky we don't have luggage.
ARCHIE: Does this trouble you?
PETULIA: A little.
ARCHIE: I suggested my place.
PETULIA: I'd always imagined a tourist cabin, with paper thin walls, the sounds of a man from Tennessee in the cabin next door, sobbing endlessly, "M4ude, Maude, Maude 8 8"'
CONTINUED: Archie sees a car moving through the processes of E registration. Grabbing Petulia's hand, he starts to what is presumably the entrance at least it is the bottom of the ramp. They arrive at the booth and Archie steps on the. place marked 'Stand Here.' A T.V. screen lights up.
PETU LIA: Lost in a hailstorm this side of Pocatello, Idaho. Those hailstones really came down, didn't they, Zeke?
ARCHIE: No auto.
ARCHIE: Only if we make it one.
PETULIA: Do you have any slides or swings for children?
PETULIA: No, no. I was told to be suspicious of motels which cater to the family trade.
WELL: There is a small sound and a gadget reaches out which normally would fasten to the side of the car. On it is an electronic register, an electronic pen and a key with a great metal tag ( as an example of how this might be designed, I recommend visiting a drive-in bank in Los Angeles ). As Archie registers, and puts the ten dollar bill where it belongs, Petulia looks at the T.V. set.

Archie is aghast at the pulsating key.

ARCHIE: ( PLAINTIVELY ) My apartment's only four blocks from
HERE: 7 INT. DREAM MOTEL ROOM Stark is hardly the word but it will have to do. A control panel takes care of the drapes, T.V., stereo, announcements from the office, etc., etc., etc. There are mirrors everywhere and the first thing Petulia does is establish contact between the vanity mirror, the mirror on the bathroom door and the medicine cabinet mirror so that she is reflected endlessly.
PETULIA: You have 624 women in this room and I'm still counting. Archie moves behind her and begins unbuttoning the top buttons on the back of her dress.
PETULIA: ( HARSHLY ) Just wait a minute, okay? Archie plops on the bed in his coat, a most iropic smile on his face he is beginning to suspect he is not going to get laid. Petulia is examining all the Petulia faces in the mirrors.
PETULIA: My great-grandmother is ninety-one and still has a granite chin. Archie pushes a gadget beside the bed and it begins to vibrate. Petulia sees endless Archies vibrating on endless beds.
7 CONTINUED: What a lecherous lot
PETULIA: What a lecherous lot
ARCHIE: She's ninety-ones eh?
PETULIA: But no fun.
ARCHIE: Not at ninety-one, hell
PETULIA: She stopped having fun at twenty-eight when her husband was killed in the first war, in a trench looking just like Cary Grant with a waxed moustache. She can't remember him but she does remember Cary Grant because he is from Bristol, too, and often in the news. If his picture is in the paper he gets a waxed moustache whether he likes it or not. She turns to face Archie. She is afraid and she is angry and she doesn-t know quite what to do from one moment to the next. But she knows he shouldn't be in an overcoat jiggling on a jiggling bed,
Â¢: Stop being so damn casual. Archie sits up but is still casual,
PETULIA: Stop being so damn casual. Archie sits up but is still casual,
PETULIA: We're about ï¿½td become lovers, Did you bring an instrument, Archie?

ARCHIE: You said that.
PETULIA: It can't be said often enough.
ARCHIE: Are we?
PETULIA: Are we what?
ARCHIE: About to become lovers?
PETULIA: Ah, you swinging young marrieds. He leaves.
ARCHIE: Ah, you swinging young marrieds. He leaves.
PETULIA: Where do you have to rush? If we were making love you would be exploring my navel about now. Time would be the last thing on your mind. An old man in a bathrobe, sadly out of contrast with the electronic motel, looks up from the open trunk of his car. The elevator doors open. Petulia and Archie 9 INT. ELEVATOR The elevator doors shut and inside the elevator a loud speaker begins playing a medley of San Francisco You. look like a gargoyle. Poor, dumb Archie. I'm all mixed up sexually. Old Mum's a prostitute. The oldest professional lady in 0 all Bristol. Mavis, too, my sister. But I mean she's not a landmark yet.

9 CONTINUED: During this Archie notices that the back of Petulia's dress remains unbuttoned. He moves behind her and begins rebuttoning her. At the touch of his hand, something happens to Petulia.
ARCHIE: Real honest-to-God tears, Petulia?
PETULIA: Tears, Archie.
ARCHIE: Petulia, you're a kook. He exits the elevator and whistles at a cruising cab.
ARCHIE: If he gets you there in time, you can still pick the winning ticket and make somebody happy.
PETULIA: ( very quietly ) Archie, I'm going to marry you. The cab pulls away and Archie sees Petulia looking at him through the rear window. Archie allows himself the drollest of smiles.
ARCHIE: It's the Pepsi generation 0 He walks into the night alone.
ARCHIE: ( into phone ) I'm up, thanks. Then his dizzy brain realizes the ringing is continuing and is constant. He sees the alarm clock, 6:1 He stumbles and staggers to the front door.
ARCHIE: Yeah. yeah 000 yeah 000 He opens the door to come face to face with the large and twirly front end of a tuba. The tuba is stark white for no particular reason.
ARC HIE: I'll make some coffee. Petulia blows with all her strength, emitting a sad little peep, then collapses to the floor, tuba and all.
PETULIA: Aren't I a kook? If you think you're
SURPRISED: ( at the same time ) No, I've been up for hours, waiting for the doorbell to ring,
ARCHIE: ( at the same time ) No, I've been up for hours, waiting for the doorbell to ring,
PETULIA: , 0 think how surprised the-man who owns all that broken glass.
PETULIA'S VOICE: Archie, how come the burglar alarm didn't go off?
PETULIA: Wherets it all going to end if the burglar alarms won't go off? Take me to bed, Archie,
ARCHIE: Get the hell out of here . please. He reaches to help Petulia to her feet but as he touches her waist to lift her, she screams and faints,
16 CONTINUED: I've got a broken rib, I think, I can feel it broken, Archie.
PETULIA: I've got a broken rib, I think, I can feel it broken, Archie.
ARCHIE: Don't you know you can puncture a lunge
PETULIA: Hopping around with tubas and stuff isntt it kooky, though? Archie has begun to remove her dress.
PETULIA: When are we going to stop trying to undress me?
ARCHIE: Shut up.
PETULIA: Leave me alone, Archie. Archie sees she really means it,
ARCHIE: It's just a rib to me,
PETULIA: That's why. Call a proper doctor,
ARCHIE: What do you think I am?
PETULIA: A hairy legged old lecher running around in pajama bottoms,
ARCHIE: Get your clothes off,
PETULIA: As a woman, not as a rib. Archie is harassed. The phone begins ringing. He grabs it angrily.
ARCHIE: ( into phone ) I'm awake! I'm awake; How many times are you gonna call?I He hangs up, then realizes this was the first wake up call.
16 CONTINUED: E ARCHIE ( to Petulia ) You know what a- you'll drive me cuckoo. He sighs. and begins dialing a number. Petulia is in real pain. Like a,little child she crawls under the covers of his bed, pulling the quilt up around her as though Archie's left over warmth will make the pain go away.

ARCHIE: ( into phone ) Barney? Archie. Fine fine , , fine , I want you to look at a patient for me. Now. At my place. My apartment, Barney, it's very complicated and I haven't had my morning coffee yet. Her name is Petulia. I don't know her last name, Barney. Yes, Petulia. Barney, shut up. I have to get to the hospital.
PETULIA: You've got a super build for a man your age. Archie says nothing. He crosses to the bathroom and hastily begins dressing.
PETULIA: Where are all the family pictures? Archie is busy brushing his teeth,
PETULIA: ( LOUDLY ) The family pictures! He looks out from the bathroom blankly,
PETULIA: Polo and the boys.

PETULIA: WhatÂ°s her real name?
ARCHIE: And you named her Polo. That's kind of sickening, Archie. Archie stops his dressing long enough to gaze at this girl in his bed, beyond which is an overturned tuba. Archie sighs somewhat philosophically, not nearly as amused as you'd think.

Â¢: seven whom we have seen earlier as a bloody mess in the flashback. Now, Oliver is healing nicely, but it's still not pleasant to be examined. A woman hovers in the back- ground. A nurse assists Archie. Oliver is a brave, solemn little boy, with shadows of fatigue around his eyes. He is also a tough little bastard, let me tell you. He is now wearing the broken gold watch; though to fit his skinny wrist the band has been tied in a knot,
ARCHIE: I want him here every day. For therapy.
WOMAN: Si, Yes, doctor. I do, Oliver speaks only a few words of English, mostly the necessary scatological and sexual phrases that would be necessary in his line of business.
ARCHIE: Every day. Tell him that. The woman says it to Oliver in Spanish. Oliver says something obviously obscene.
17 CONTINUED: What'd he say?
ARCHIE: What'd he say?
WOMAN: ( EMBARRASSED ) He say yes.
ARCHIE: ( dubiously, to woman ) You sure? ( to Oliver ) Otherwise we keep you in the hospital. You're not well, just better. ( to woman ) Say that. The woman tells Oliver in Spanish as Archie continues examining the leg.
ARCHIE: Sorry, pal. Oliver says something in Spanish.
Â¢: Where he learn such words shame on you. ( then in Spanish ) Archie realizes Oliver is in great pain and close to tears. He stops the examination and rubs his hand gently through the kid's hair,
ARCHIE: Every day. Same time. Two o'clock, right on the dot. ( he hits watch on wrist. The last bit of glass falls out. ) Sorry , , Oliver swears in Spanish and the woman clacks her tongue.
WOMAN: ( EMBARRASSED ) He terrible.

He is draped in plastic which creates a sub-atmosphere. The doctors and nurses are swathed in plastic, again in the atmosphere that lets them function best, ( This is for real. It exists, for instance, at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York. ) The doctors and nurses communicate with each other through throat mikes and seem like other world automatons.

PETULIA: Somehow or other we begin to sense that madness has entered what is really a commonplace scene. Something has gone wrong and we can't for the life of us under- stand what and before we can even guess, we are:
PETULIA: ( she speaks slowly because he doesn't understand English ) I came by to make sure there was enough milk and things. He finds the situation amusing, reaching in past Petulia to grab an orange. There should be a feeling of a possible relationship between Petulia and this man. In the next room a screen door opens and closes. Petulia closes the ice box door and we and she see Oliver and the Woman standing in the doorway.
30 CONTINUED: Polo looks about the apartment dubiously, from tuba to unmade bed. She can't keep her eyes off the unmade bed.
ARCHIE: ( after `awhile ) Hi, Polo.
POLO: It's very nice. Archie looks at her questioningly.
POLO: I've never been here before. It's very nice.
ARCHIE: It's strange, coming into your husband's bachelor apartment for the first time. Feels slightly illegal. Is that a tuba?
POLO: It's strange, coming into your husband's bachelor apartment for the first time. Feels slightly illegal. Is that a tuba?
ARCHIE: That's a tuba.
POLO: Make a marvelous lamp.
ARCHIE: You just had to say it.
POLO: Predictable Polo.
ARCHIE: "Predictable Polo." Has a certain zing. How're the kids?
POLO: Looking forward to the weekend. Lest I forget She opens her large handbag, takes out a cellophane bag of cookies.
POLO: As usual, I baked enough for an army.
ARCHIE: 0 30 CONTINUED This is very strange. I didntt think I'd feel like this. Mostly sad. Archie's sad, too, therefore he is more brusque than necessary. Also he is bugged by the cookies.
POLO: This is very strange. I didntt think I'd feel like this. Mostly sad. Archie's sad, too, therefore he is more brusque than necessary. Also he is bugged by the cookies.
ARCHIE: You need anything, Polo?
POLO: No. Well, yes. Well, yes and no.
ARCHIE: ( SMILING ) I think that covers all the possibilities. Polo laughs, suddenly they share a moment of warmth.
POLO: It's such a puzzle. We really got on so marvelously. Never fought. Never screamed at each other. Not once. â¢ Something in his silence, plus that damned unmade bed, is beginning to make her angry.
POLO: Everybody we knew envied us.
ARCHIE: We were a handsome couple. This makes her so angry she can now say what she came to say.
POLO: I think I've fallen in love. The man is Warren Smith. He's an engineer and very good with the children, but he wants to go back to school and get his masters in hydraulics. ( very long pause ) Well, say something.
ARCHIE: ( BLANDLY ) I think that's fine, Polo.
ARCHIE: ( no answer ) Were going to'be married.
POLO: Were going to'be married.
ARCHIE: ( into phone ) 31 INT. DANNER HOUSE NIGHT ' David is on the phone and Petulia'has just entered. David hangs up the phone.
PETULIA: â¢ DAVID She stops. She waits for a moment, wondering if the scene she imagined on the bus is now going to occur. Will David now say, "Just for a second there .?"
PETULIA: She stops. She waits for a moment, wondering if the scene she imagined on the bus is now going to occur. Will David now say, "Just for a second there .?"
DAVID: Come on, let's eat. Morrie finally got a shipment of Dungeness crab.
PETULIA: About time.
DAVID: Well, poor guy. They had all that trouble. David crosses to the dining area. And that's that.
POLO: Not right away. He's also divorced. There's alimony . child support It looks absolutely obscene.
ARCHIE: ( ANNOYED ) So the kids like him, eh?
POLO: Adore him.
ARCHIE: How about that?
POLO: Don't you have maid service?
ARCHIE: ( SUDDENLY ) What the hell are you doing, bringing me cookies? He flings the bag at her, barely missing her. They are both stunned by this outburst,
'OLO: â¢ ( shakily ) natured For two people who never fight Absently, Polo sags down on the edge of the unmade bed, which has so fascinated her. During the following, no matter what their bodies happen to be doing, Polo and Archie continue to speak in a most logical manner.
ARCHIE: What's so great about not fighting?
POLO: I came to tell you about Warren,
ARCHIE: You told me about Warren. He sits beside her, well not really beside her, actually as far away from her as the bed will permit. She decides she will instantly get up off the bed, but she does not.
ARCHIE: ( CONTINUING ) Warren is working for his m'tstah's in hydraulics.
POLO: Well, I'm afraid well still need all the money you pay me. And I'll be seeing him, Archie
Â¢: and I get married, which won't be
POLO: ( CONTINUING ) until he is established with some hydraulics firma I hope it won't be too long, I mean for everybody's sake.
ARCHIE: If he's a bright guy, he'll make out okay.
POLO: Needless to say there are certain problems. By now, Archie is on top of Polo, and out of habit she is adjusting her body for him.
POLO: He lives in such a depressing, rented room. It gives me claustrophobia.
ARCHIE: Poor Polo.
POLO: It's such an icky little room. Archie is, perhaps, two seconds away from entering Polo, when he suddenly sits up, wondering what the hell he's been doing. He walks to the far side of the room, sticks his shirt in, wipes the sleeve of his shirt across his face. Polo feels no particular rancor, the entire thing was totally unplanned, and she has no more desire to "make it" with Archie than he has with her. She pulls down her skirt and adjusts her garters.
ARCHIE: Tell the kids I'll come for them 0 Sunday at eight.
POLO: They'll be ready. I thought the decent thing was to come here and talk in a civilized manner. About the change in my situation.
ARCHIE: I appreciate it, Polo.
POLO: Good night, Archie.
ARCHIE: You've got a run in your stocking. Polo exits, Archie can't figure out why in the world he even thought of making love to Polo after all this time. He sits down on the unmade bed, finds one of Polo's cookies on the sheets, and pops it into his 33. EXT. TEA GARDEN DAY 0 It's a busy Saturday and everything is lovely. A
33 CONTINUED: LARGE GUARD with a bull horn is keeping people moving on the Japanese bridge. Many soldiers on pass, a few hippies, but mostly just tourists.
LARGE GUARD: ( with bull horn ) Now you folks keep moving along that bridge. You keep moving along and give other folks a chance. There's lots of pretty things to do. You keep moving right along. You won't want to forget our Niponese souvenir pagoda where every item is the real McCoy. That's right. Keep moving, that's the ticket. Sergeant, you've been standing there some time now. During this, MAY and Archie talk. '.s 32 and pretty. Its a nice day but Archie is not happy. Polo, Warren, maybe Petulia mostly it's kind of a lousy day to be a bachelor, . and May have been sitting on the grass. Gracefully she rises to her feet, doing everything just right, even this. 0 She puts away her portable martini kit.
ARCHIE: Nobody in the world can sit on the grass and not wrinkle. She looks.
ARCHIE: No, perfect. Not even a blade of grass. Why don't I marry you, May?
MAY: Why don't you, Ar^hie? They walk along holding hands. Archie should feel better than he does.
ARCHIE: Tell me about Bobby Kennedy. She looks at him, smiling.
ARCHIE: ( SHRUGGING ) Picasso? Pickles? She smiles tolerantly as they walk along.
ARCHIE: Choose a subject. Ice cubes. Any damn thing. Take either side. Talk for thirty seconds against ice cubes.
MAY: ( EASILY ) Why the hostility, Archie?
ARCHIE: That dress shop of yours. "Boutique." I've never seen one of those . your rubber mannequins .. I've never once seen the pipe sticking out of their bottoms. Not once, not one damn time. That bothers me, May. May stops. She doesn1t know whether to be annoyed or amused. Shets a little of both.
ARCHIE: I'm not hostile, it's frustration. In all that perfection, how could a clumsy clot like me possibly be fitted in? I mean, without spoiling the whole effect. They have now reached the area of the stunted trees. Nuns are passing through empty benches; kids are improvising on the stage and shouting.
MAY: Don't worry about it. You'll be going back to Polo.
ARCHIE: No, she's found a fellah.
MAY: She watches the kids for a moment.
MAY: I'd just about given up on you,
ARCHIE: What I should do is marry you. For May this has been said once too often. She is now
Â¢: thoroughly annoyed.
KAY: Archie, if it would please you, I'll submit a list of my faults, some of which might shake you up a bit.
ARCHIE: It would be a fake list.
MAY: Probably, It wouldn't be a fake list. Actually, I wear arch supports, my depilatory causes a nasty little rash, and I've lost 10% of my hearing in less than a year .. Okay?
ARCHIE: They laugh, kiss, grab at each other, and hurry toward the parking lot for Archie's car.
OKAY;: They laugh, kiss, grab at each other, and hurry toward the parking lot for Archie's car.
ARCHIE: Well of all people.
PETULIA: All that crap about the humanitarian- ism of the medical profession. She darts alongside the building and begins frantically calling to a little old man in white duck pants and an "aloha" hat, May looks at Archie questioningly.
ARCHIE: Don't ask. Petulia and the old man are back joining Archie and May on the steps.
PETULIA: ( ACCUSINGLY ) Archie, this is Mr. Howard.
PETULIA: Mr. Howard is the'watchman for the "Friends of the Evergreen." Or was.
ARCHIE: The tuba.
PETULIA: No wonder people are becoming cynical about doctors.
ARCHIE: I tried to return it. The place was locked.
MR. HOWARD: No harm done,
PETULIA: â¢ I didn't expect this of you, I tried to return the tuba Friday
ARCHIE: I tried to return the tuba Friday
NIGHT;: MR. HOWARD It's O.K.
MR. HOWARD: It's O.K.
PETULIA: ( accusingly to
ARCHIE ): The "Friends of the Evergreen" are very proud of their brass band.
MR. HOWARD: All's well that ends well.
PETULIA: Stay out of this, Mr. Howard. She sees May watching all this with wry amusement.
PETULIA: I'm Petulia Danner. I'm sorry about 0 35 INT. ARCHIE'S APARTMENT DAY Mr. Howard is casually testing the valves on the tuba.
ARCHIE: ( looking at Petulia ) All that broken glass
MR. HOWARD: ( finished with the tuba ) Its okay. Archie crosses to the front door and opens it.
ARCHIE: Goodbye, Mr. Howard. Goodbye, Petulia. Petulia crosses to Mr. Howard and presses a dollar bill into his shirt pocket.
Â¢: Take a taxi. You can at least say you're sorry, Archie.
PETULIA: Take a taxi. You can at least say you're sorry, Archie.
ARCHIE: I'm sorry, Mr, Howard. Goodbye, Petulia. But Petulia just sits on the edge of a chair tapping her fingers in annoyance. Mr. Howard leaves. The door remains open for Petulia to leave. May watches Petulia in amused tolerance.
ARCHIE: What's the next move, Petulia?
PETULIA: I'd like to discuss your irresponsibility. People are passing in the hallway, peering in.
ARCHIE: Goodbye, Petulia.
Â¢: My rib. Archie slams the door shut ets a bottle and a couple g of glasses, pointedly, exclu ding Petulia.
PETULIA: My rib. Archie slams the door shut ets a bottle and a couple g of glasses, pointedly, exclu ding Petulia.
ARCHIE: I should explain about Petuliaa She is a kook. We are going to be married.
PETULIA: Archie, when you try to sound cool and "with it," you're really pathetic. We're trying to have an intelligent About what?
ARCHIE: About what?
PETULIA: Well, about Polo, among other things.
ARCHIE: Polo is none of your damned business.
PETULIA: That's dumb. Dumb. She's my business and she's this lady's business. I happen to hate Polo.
ARCHIE: ( to May ) Needless to say she's never even met Polo.
PETULIA: I look at you and I know Polo. ( to Map ) Explain that to him. May looks at Archie in bewilderment, she is not quite sure how to react; but when she makes up her mind it will be the exactly right reaction. Also, in all truth, Petulia is frightened by May.
PETULIA: How many years were you married., Archie? Eight? Ten? Anyhow, the best, Wasted. Gone down the drain.
ARCHIE: Oh, come on ..o
PETULIA: Archie, we are from two different worlds. We've got nothing to agree on. Except one thing. You're a lonely screwed up mess. 0 Archie, I'm trying to save you. You're a very special man.
ARCHIE: Oh, God.
PETULIA: Tell him, May. Petulia doesn't like May's amused reaction.
PETULIA: You don't think so?
MAY: I won't put Archie on a pedestal. He'll do.
PETULIA: ( ANGRY ) You've got yourself another winner, Archie.
MAY: ( to Archie ) It's a joke, you're both putting me on.
ARC HIE: Petulia. I mean it. Tubas. All this E "I Love Lucy" jazz. It's only cute for It's not meant to be cute. I'm fighting for your life.
PETULIA: It's not meant to be cute. I'm fighting for your life.
ARCHIE: Who's trying to kill me?
MAY: The two million, five hundred thousand subscribers to the "Ladies Home Journal" . right, dear?
ARCHIE: Petulia, go home and save what's his name. I really don't want to see you anymore. Archie's voice is cold. Petulia is suddenly defeated, mostly by May. She gets up and leaves.
PETULIA'S VOICE: Archie turns. Petulia is in the medical library with books scattered all about her.
ARCHIE: You're kidding.
PETULIA: I think I've discovered a cure for cancer.
ARCHIE: Well, if you're on the brink of something. How did they let you in.
Â¢: She joins him.
PETULIA: You look exhausted.
ARCHIE: Do you know it's almost three? Doesn't Mr. Danner worry at all about things like that? Petulia looks at him reverently.
PETULIA: ( TENDERLY ) Look at you. Archie is so unaccustomed to hearing a straight line from Petulia that her tone and look of tenderness stop him for a moment. Then, without a word, they fall into step beside each other, leaving the hospital.
37 CONTINUED: ARC HIE Shall I drop you off? ( she doesn't answer ) It's too late for the bus. She gets in.
ARC HIE: Shall I drop you off? ( she doesn't answer ) It's too late for the bus. She gets in.
ARCHIE: Petulia, you've got to stop following me around like this. Petulia is absolutely silent but her eyes are devouring him with infinite tenderness which Archie is finding very touching. It is a facet of Petulia he has never seen before.
ARCHIE: Where to? I could use a steak sandwich. There's a jazz joint that stays open all night. He reaches to start the car just as she grabs at him, â¢ awkwardly, aggressively.
ARCHIE: ( SURPRISED ) Hey, come on Â®m why this sudden Petulia is relentless and voracious. Her hands and mouth are everywhere on Archie. A car is a lousy bedroom but it will have to do. Heads bump against windows, elbows jam against steering wheels, but Petulia will not be stopped. Finally, Archie grips her shoulders and forces her to stop.
ARCHIE: ARC HIE Not here.
PETULIA: ARC HIE Not here.
ARC HIE: Not here.
ARCHIE: It m not really hungry.
PETULIA: I'm starving.
ARCHIE: Am I being punished?
PETULIA: Loganberry jam . we'll have a case.
ARCHIE: I'd rather have a new plastic raincoat.
PETULIA: You don't save anything on plastic raincoats.
ARCHIE: Shall I get another cart? Polo can fill three or four when she really puts her mind to it. Petulia gets the point and instantly takes her place
WOMAN SHOPPER: ( as if it's Petulia's fault ) You know what time it is? It's after fivB.
PETULIA: Ilia sorry.
WOMAN SHOPPER: I want to go to bed.
PETULIA: So do we.
ARCHIE: ( into phone ) Okay. Wells why not do some slides anyhow? ( in sudden anger ) To satisfy myself, that's who. Okay. He hangs up the phone and sees Petulia looking at him.
ARCHIE: Well, we knocked off another one. Another notch in the old stethoscope.
PETULIA: You're a wonderful doctor, Archie.
ARCHIE: I keep a little black bow tie in my desk. In 0 case the services are in the morning and 1 have no time to go home. The neekband's all stained with sweat.
45 CONTINUED: Why are you dressed?
PETULIA: Why are you dressed?
ARCHIE: Have to pick up the, kids, I'm already late.
PETULIA: You're not abandoning me? I mean, I wasn't all that bad, was I?
ARCH IE: Amateur night, He leans over and kisses her mouth.
PETULIA: Before I've brushed my teeth? Are you a communist, Archie?
ARCHIE: I guess so
PETULIA: Tell Mike to watch that weight.
ARCHIE: Will you be here when I get back?
PETULIA: ( SMILING ) Dumb, Archie. Dumb. Archie starts out, then stops, troubled.
PETULIA: I'm divorcing David, if that's what you mean,
ARCHIE: I'm divorcing David, if that's what you mean,
WELL: I'm divorcing David, if that's what you mean,
PETULIA: I'm divorcing David, if that's what you mean,
ARC HIE: ( SHARPLY ) That's none of my business. Petulia is suddenly hurt.
PETULIA: Phone me.
ARCHIE: 0 45 CONTINUED Listen, this worries me. Really.
PETULIA: Listen, this worries me. Really.
ARCHIE: Listen, this worries me. Really.
PETULIA: Write the Number down so you won't forget. Archie grins, sighs, and starts out. Petulia will do anything to hold him one second more.
PETULIA: Hey,, you. Archie turns at the door.
PETULIA: Don't have any illusions about all those groceries. I can't cook.
ARCHIE: And you hate loganberry Jam.
PETULIA: No, as a matter of fact, I rather like it. He smiles, continues out.
PETULIA: If somebody calls and wants medical advice on something really obscure, is it okay if I wing it on my own? He makes an amused "you nuts" gesture and leaves, but not before Petulia says:
PETULIA: He is gone.
ARCHIE: ( into phone ) ( to boys ) Shut up, you guys,
PETULIA'S VOICE: Hi. What's all the noise?
ARCHIE: Fat Mike?
PETULIA: Fat Mike?
ARCHIE: He's not all that fat. During this series of dumb, ordinary telephone conversa-
Â¢: tions to follow,, we begin seeing the moments which have brought on Petulia's current crisis with Oliver.
PAUSE: PETULIA: I had a tall glass of pineapple juice. ARCHIE: Make some toast, too. And milk. Breakfast is a very important meal. PETULIA: I wish you'd remember that. ARCHIE: Well, goodbye. 0 PETULIA: Archie? ARCHIE: Yes? PETULIA: You won't forget to phone.
ARCHIE: They used to think that escape from that prison was impossible.
WARREN: They used to think that escape from that prison was impossible.
SI: 52B Continued
MIKE: Yes, Dad. Warren told us that last week.
ARCHIE: Warren. Well, we could have gone somewhere else. I didn't know you had been.
STEVIE: ( the youngest ) We thought maybe you had never been, Dad.
ARCHIE: No - well, thanks, actually I haven't been before, Stevie.
MIKE: In fact, we don't call him Stevie anymore.
ARCHIE: Who doesn't?
MIKE: Mom thinks he's getting a little old for being called Stevie, in fact.
Â¢: I called you Stevie two weeks ago -e we were all calling you Stevie two weeks ago I was.
ARCHIE: I called you Stevie two weeks ago -e we were all calling you Stevie two weeks ago I was.
STEVIE: Before that.
MIKE: Warren says that Alcatraz taught the world you can get out of anything if you want to bad That's what Warren said, eh?
ARCHIE: That's what Warren said, eh?
MIKE: Yes, Dad.
53 CONTINUED: How about clams on the wharf when we get back?
ARCHIE: How about clams on the wharf when we get back?
MIKE: Clams make Steve vomit.
ARCHIE: You forgot that.
MIKE: You forgot that.
ARCHIE: No, it just slipped my mind. Archie really does like his kids but his thoughts are somewhere else.
ARCHIE: â¢ Hello there.
LATE AFTERNOON: 55 EXT. THE BORDER GATE AT TIJUANA During this silent scene we watch Oliver seduce Petulia into giving him a lift in her convertible. Petulia is so bored as the cars take hours to get past the gate, Oliver is an absolute scoundrel. David is such a clod, passing out in the back seat, his legs hanging out over the door of the car, one sandal missing. His beautiful face is somehow an obscene parody of itself, fiery red from the sun. Oliver mimics David, Petulia, the guard at the gate, dances, skips, romps, annoys Petulia, makes her laugh, dares her, goads her. Finally, when Petulia's car is just one away from the border guard, Oliver impudently hops into the seat beside her, expecting to be thrown out but also expecting maybe a nickel in the bargain. But the joke's on Oliver. Petulia is even kookier than he is. Is it the look of David that sickens her? Is it her annoyance at having to wait so long and do the driving while he lies collapsed and useless? Is it that "useless" that goads her?
55 CONTINUED: Most of all Petulia is doing something of absolutely no importance; she knows Oliver will hop out of the car the moment they reach the guard. All it amounts to is two kooks having a few seconds of horsing around. The joke is on both of them the guard, harassed by the honking of thousands of cars and having fully inspected the car just ahead of Petulia, waves the convertible on through. Petulia stops the car a few hundred yards past the border to let Oliver climb out, but he just sits there. Petulia thinks, "okay, you little bastard . " and zooms down the highway, intending to stop at the first moment the look of superior arrogance leaves Oliver's tough little face. During this we hear Archie and Petulia's second tele- phone conversation which is as blab and loving as before. ARCHIE: Hi, there. PETULIA: Hello. ARCHIE: I'm having lunch with the boys. PETULIA: You eat a good lunch, Archie, ARCHIE: I will, I will. ARCHIE: I'll eat a good lunch, Petulia. PETULIA: Like what? ARCHIE: Petulia, they have a thousand different PETULIA: You should have a sirloin steak with french fries or baked beans. ARCHIE: Okay. PETULIA: That's easy to say, Archie, But I know you. ARCHIE: Steak with french fries or baked beans. PETULIA: Do they have fresh sea-food? ARCHIE: Yes. PETULIA: Sea bass is nice. ARCHIE: Yes, sea bass is great. PETULIA: If they grill it, ARCHIE: I'll have grilled sea bass. PETULIA: Unless they do a nice omelet. ARCHIE: I'm sure they would if I asked. PETULIA: It's such a problem. ARCHIE: Yes, I know. Goodbye, Petulia. PETULIA: Phone.
ARCHIE: Warren take you here?
MIKE: He would see the sign, eh? See
ARCHIE: He would see the sign, eh? See
STEVIE: Hey, this is great. Archie chases them through the floors. Archie sees a telephone above which is a sign which says that this phone is for the military and is to be used only in emergency. Archie approaches it warily, then loses his nerve and turns back to his kids. Archie wants to get back to Petulia.
ARCHIE: The boys look at him uncertainly.
ARCHIE: ( CONTINUING ) Its ten to two. Can you imagine that? The time really went The boys know that means he wants to take them home.
ARCHIE: ( CONTINUING ) I'm really bushed.
MIKE: ( COLDLY ) I feel okay. Stevie is willing to let his dad off the hook.
STEVIE: I been sneezing.
58 CONTINUED: So I noticed.
ARCHIE: So I noticed.
MIKE: He's always sneezing.
ARC HIE: Hey, next week I want you guys over for the entire weekend. None of this three or four hour stuff.
STEVIE: All weekend?
ARCHIE: Why not?
MIKE: To do what?
ARCHIE: You 'gust wait!
ARCHIE: Bet your life'.
MIKE: Just leave it to melt
ARCHIE: Just leave it to melt
MIKE: Warren said something about the Roller Derby.
ARCHIE: Friday night till late Sunday?
STEVIE: Friday night till late Sunday?
ARCHIE: Unless you guys don't want to.
MIKE: The Roller Derby's pretty darn interesting.
ARCHIE: 58 CONTINUED We'd have to sleep over. I mean if we were going to spend the whole weekend.
58 CONTINUED: We'd have to sleep over. I mean if we were going to spend the whole weekend.
MIKE: We'd have to sleep over. I mean if we were going to spend the whole weekend.
ARCHIE: I want you to.
MIKE: ( SUDDENLY ) Well, it's fine by me.
STEVIE: Me toot Boy l
ARCHIE: Okay, it's a dealt Mike turns away.
STEVIE: He's going to cry I guess he does that.
ARCHIE: A nice, neat kid. After all the exuberance he feels so empty. Everywhere things are scattered about.
61 CONTINUED: Thï¿½-, phone is off the hook. Archie doesn't know where to turn first. He feels Petulia's throat for a pulse, isn't sure she has one, Petulia is wearing his hooded sweatshirt from Se. 23. Archie attempts heart massage, but Petuliats so taped up from the broken rib that this is impossible. Archie presses his mouth over Petulia's to attempt to get her breathing again. He tries this only for an instant then crosses to the phone, hangs it up and dials an emergency number. Archie goes back to Petulia. He feels again for a pulse in her throat, can find no pulse. He begins trembling. As always when a crisis really happens, it isn't as easy as the Red Cross advertisements say. Her mouth won't open right. His mouth seems unable to make the connection with hers. It all looks more like very bad love-making than a life-saving procedure.
DOG'S OWNER: Don't you hit Lennie! Archie is too distressed about Petulia to even respond. At every door there is a tenant. A jumble of voices all spoken together.
1ST TENANT: 0 That's sex for you.
2ND TENANT: It could be a gas leak.
62 CONTINUED: 0 3RD TENANT She's dead.
4TH TENANT: Those rescue cops never give up.
5TH TENANT: Yes'. but they're all racists. Of course, one of the officers is a Korean and the other a Negro. All through this we have also been aware of many T.V. sets, all with programs with various kinds of violence. One youbgster comes to the door holding a portable T.V. and we see on the tube war casualties being flown out of the Jungle by helicopters. Archie has crossed ahead of the special officers to lead the way down the steps. Half a dozen "hippies"' loaded down with Chinese food and a yellow guitar are coming up the steps. Everything is chaos. The officers just can't manage the stretcher down the narrow stairway. Poor Petulia is twisted and turned every which way - all in the name of saving her life.
7TH TENANT: ( a rich old queen in purple Bermuda shorts ) I had trouble like that with my piano. Two hundred dollars to bring it through the window. And its never been the same. A record player is playing a Herb Alpert recording and the stretcher seems to move along to its rhythm.

63 CONTINUED: David takes a sip of coffee. Oliver grabs at the orange juice, toppling it, spilling some of it on the seat but saving most. He gulps it down then uses the straw to make bubbles. David looks at Oliver and then at Petulia, all through the bubbles.
PETULIA: Say hello to "Petulia"s Folly." David says nothing.
DAVID: PET ULIA ( with careful wit ) If, in the past, you thought me a bit odd, feast your eyes on this little goodie.
PET ULIA: ( with careful wit ) If, in the past, you thought me a bit odd, feast your eyes on this little goodie.
DAVID: WhatÂ°s the problem?
PETULIA: ( to Oliver ) Why can't you speak English? ( to David ) Why the hell don't they teach them English? This little hustler picked me up in Tijuana
DAVID: ( to Oliver, very gently ) What's your name?
PETULIA: I've got a name for him! Oliver doesn't understand what is being said, but he is getting uneasy.
O LIVER: Lady say "hey come on us go San Francisco ten bucks."
PETULIA: ( CONTINUING ) I never did! She's worried about David.
PETULIA: What I said to this malicious little fink was that maybe one day if we went back to Tijuana
DAVIT?: ( to Oliver ) San Francisco?
OLIVER: San Francisco. Each says it in his own accent, and so begins a word game.
DAVID: ( GIGGLING ) San Francisco.
OLIVER: { GIGGLING ) San Francisco.
DAVID: Okay. "San Francisco." 0 He pronounces it like Oliver.
PET ULIA: David doesn't answer her.
DAVID: David doesn't answer her.
DAVID: ( to Oliver ) What's your name? ( in bad Spanish ) What are you called?
OLIVER: ( pronouncing it Spanish ) ( pronouncing it English ) ( pronouncing it Spanish ) They begin laughing again. Petulia is becoming completely unnerved.
DAVID: ( pronouncing it English ) ( pronouncing it Spanish ) They begin laughing again. Petulia is becoming completely unnerved.
OLIVER: ( pronouncing it Spanish ) They begin laughing again. Petulia is becoming completely unnerved.
PETULIA: David. The San Diego bus is due at twelve fifteen. I've already bought him a ticket.
DAVID: We've got to get this on tape. He's really something else'. I get a real kick out of him! ( imitating Oliver ) "San Francisco." Unless he's a midget. Hey, sure!

DAVID: ( to Petulia ) Get in. It's still a long drive. We'll never get home.
PETULIA: Okay. He can wait inside. The cashier's a sweet old dear. I'll have him keep an eye on the ckeeky little bugger! 0 She opens the car door to take Oliver out, tense, wanting to get past this moment but fearful that she won't.
DAVID: You promised "Oliver" "San Francisco."
PETULIA: I did not.
DAVID: Like hell you didn't'. David abruptly hops over the seat and sits behind the wheel. He signals for Petulia to get in beside Oliver. Petulia hesitates.
DAVID: I dig, bitch, I dig! She's stunned. His hand reaches out and brutally jerks her into the car.
DAVID: I dig. CAMERA HOLDS on Petulia's frightened face. Now suddenly 0 the face has a tube in the nose; there's another tube in her throat; and she's unconscious.
BARNEY'S VOICE: Hey you. Barney is looking over the shower door at Archie with a mixture of concern and anger.
BARNEY: ( shouting over sound of shower ) 0 Did you know there's a policeman outside wanting to talk to you? Archie nods dully.
BARNEY: What the hell is going on? Archie nods dully.
BARNEY: Can you have dinner with us tonight? Archie nods dully.

BARNEY: ( REMINISCING ) Had to drive Made me run a frog test on her. forty miles in the rain. Almost hit a truck. Could have been dead and buried three years. Through this Barney keeps changing slides. Suddenly there is a picture of Archie, Polo and Wilma on another vacation. In this slide they are posing in corny T-shirts. The T-shirts say, "Kiss me you fool" and "I love the Rolling Stones"., etc.
BARNEY: Oh, hey, I'm sorry. Wilma looks very superior.
Â¢: Oh, hey, I'm sorry. Wilma looks very superior.
WILMA: I'll bet he's sorry.
BARNEY: There's nothing wrong with a little old-fashioned nostalgia.
WI LMA: Do you remember that crazy Labour Day weekend we drove to Tahoe?
BARNEY: ( too quickly ) I've got them right her Archie frowns at Wilma and Barney. But they are clumsy and obvious, and he is somewhat touched.
BARNEY: I keep everything. They just happen to be here. What do you think this is, a conspiracy?

NUN: Who would do such a thing to a girl like this? She's a child. Is there an orthopaedic problem, Dr. Bollen?
NUN: A. doctor should get his sleep.
ARCHIE: You left the needle in. The nun would like to scream at Archie about the impropriety of his presence here but she can't. She is proud of the bottle of blood.

NUN: I mentioned her this morning in the chapel. I mention all my criticals.
NUN: She hardly makes a bump under the sheets. She leaves. Archie moves closer to Petulia examining her throat and eyes for vital signs. He pushes open an eyelid and Petulia's dead eye stares glassily into his living face.

OLIVER'S ATTENDANT: Come on, come on, get on with it.
DAVID: Hey, "San Francisco"! He pronounces it like Oliver does. He comes down the steps, three at a time. He stops before the kid.
DAVID: ( GENTLY ) I sure hope there's no hard feelings. Oliver understands none of this, and of course David knows this, but it doesn't stop him.
DAVID: It isn't a question of hospitality, I want you to understand that. I feel terrible. Dragging you all the way up to San Francisco and then not even showing you Fisherman's Wharf. Petulia goes into the living room to find the keys to the car.
DA VID: 0 Hold it a minute!
DAVID: ( to Oliver ) What's the rushy Whereas the fire! He stoops down beside the boy and shows him a wrist watch.
DAVID: You've go to have some little memento. PETUL IA David, for God's sakes The wrist watch is much too big for Oliver's skinny wrist so David starts to fasten it around Oliver's biceps. Even this is too skinny so David starts fastening it around Oliver's lower leg. Oliver has no idea what is happening, but his hustler's heart tells him he is being given something very valuable. Petulia is repelled.

DAVID: ( to Oliver ) You see the basic problem is we just don't have the room for all the folks my old lady invites for a visit. Were kinda short of room. I'd give you the shirt off my back. I'm West-Texas and proud of it. But start loading up the house with make-believe kids, plus every Tom, Dick and Harry whose one and only claim to fame is that he knows how to do "it"
DAVID: Hands off! The watch won't fasten to the leg either. David tries to fit it around the boy's neck. David begins to cry.

During the preceding speech we CUT to Petulia and Oliver, Oliver, infuriated at Petulia, defiantly shows her that he has David's watch in his fist.
ARCHIE: How's your patient?

POLO: Roller Derby starts at eight.
STEVIE: We have to police the area.

78 CONTINUED: She turns to 4rchie and sees him watching the fighting The women are really brutal with each other. One small blonde lady is being, pummelled unmercifully by several others. As her head twists and turns from the forest of fists she seems to become Petulia.
STEVIE: I want to go home.
M IKE: They don't mean it.
STEVIE: I want some popcorn.
ARCHIE: I'll get it. He rises quickly and moves to the refreshment counter behind the grandstand. Archie finds a telephone booth. Polo watches him at the â¢ phone booth. Her eyes lose their warmth. The women's team races around the track. Archie returns with a box of Cracker Jacks.
STEVIE: I said popcorn.
POLO: ( COLDLY ) How is she? Dead I hope? Archie is stunned at Polo's abrupt coldness.
ARCHIE: You don't even know her.
POLO: ( COLDLY ) I just have to look at you. ,Archie stops, remembering this is approximately what Petulia had said about Polo. He does a "how odd:" without saying it.
78 CONTINUED: She's not going to die.
ARCHIE: She's not going to die.
POLO: What a shame.
ARCHIE: She has her first visitor. Mr. Danner. Polo couldn't care less. Five skaters smash into each other on the rink but Polo doesn't flinch. She wouldn't think of turning to Archie for comfort.
ARCHIE: "His Mastahs in'Hydraul:ics." They sit coldly wit4 their children, a million miles apart.
MR. DANNER: It's been a terrible shock to us. to Mother and me,..Our sailor boy and his pretty bride.
MR, DANNER: ( CONTINUING ) I must say Mother's answer surprised and, well, really sort of tickled me: "It's easy to be an angel when you're old and worn out and nobody wants you anymore," You see we do try, Petulia. I mean there you were in that man's apartment. Where I come from .in "little pockets of ignorance" I suppose you'd call it.you'll find people who still live by the unwritten law.
MR. DANNER: There's still many a county courthouse where the husband could kill both parties and not spend one night in jail, O.S. We hear SOUNDS of a bell ringing incessantly in short 79D INT. PETULIA'S HOSPITAL ROOM The bell is still ringing signifying the end of visiting hours and the other patient's visitors sigh, put the playing cards together and prepare to leave. Mr. Danner makes no move to leave,
MR. DANNER: In the hospital of my dreams people won't be chased out like sheep. People are better than most of the medicines they give you. David has finally'got around to repairing that wharf. He hired a couple of boys. The three of them are really working up a sweat. He's thinking of sailing all the way down the coast to Lima. That's in Peru. All through this there's no response whatever from Petulia. Her eyes are fixed on the eyes of the giraffe.
MR. DANNER: They say Lima is a terrific city. If you watch out for flies and take sensible sanitary precautions. I'll tell you a secret but don't you snitch: I'm using propaganda on David so that the four of 0 us can go. Mother's a better sailor than I am. Even though I served eighteen months on a mine sweeper. Which should have prepared me for anything.
NUN: ( BRIGHTLY ) Visiting hours are over.
MR. DANNER: ( taking his turmoil out on the nun ) I had lunch with your Mr. Pearl less than two weeks ago; The nun looks blank.
MR. DANNER: Mr. Pearl happens to be the superintendent of this Hospital; Two weeks ago at the Blue Fox Restaurants Just the six of usl The nun shrugs and leaves. Mr. Danner is really trembling now from his controlled emotion. Petulia will not take her eyes from the giraffe. The patient in the next bed is grumbling something about "what's sauce for the goose should be' sauce for the gander", etc. Mr. Danner abruptly takes a â¢ small leather bound photograph from his pocket. It's the
NUN: I'm sorry Sir, but it's time for the lady's medication.
MR. DANNER: Does anyone ever report how filthy this room is? He loses all his aplomb, He squats, he points, he finds imaginary objects on the floor.
MR, DANNER: Look at this'. Look at this! I personally raised fifty thousand dollars for this Hospital during the last campaign. You didn't know that did you; Well ask Mr, Pearl'. I mean if you knew what he looked like'. Filthy'. He gets up to go, The nun leaves, Mr. Danner brushes imaginary dust from his knees. He's perspiring, dis- hevelled, and still hasnÂ°t said what he came to say. He waits there a moment more, Finally in a flat voice
PETULIA: Tell David, it's alright. He can come out of the cupboard. The old man almost sobs. Instead he exclaims in a jolly voice.
MR. DANNER: Chin up'.
OLD MAN: I'm not sick! Don't waste time on me! Archie turns to face the nun in attendance.
ARCHIE: Where is she?
NUN: Mrs. Danner? They picked her up. Dr. Worthington said it was alright so long as she had proper nursing.
ARCHIE: Who picked her up.
NUN: Her husband I suppose.
ARCHIE: They had a long talk with Dr. Worthington. He seemed entirely satisfied.
DANNER: They had a long talk with Dr. Worthington. He seemed entirely satisfied.

OLD MAN: Take care of the sick people! I'm in tip-top shape!
IS: special hospital bed. There are flowers everywhere. She has her own colour T.V. set which is silently showing scenes of violence. An efficient nurse is in attendance.
85 CONTINUED: 0 The nurse is sitting at the foot of the bed, and Petulia is brushing the nurse's hair. Archie stands in the doorway overwhelmed at the normality of it all. Obviously Petulia has fixed her hair too.
PETULIA: Hi Archie. Dazedly Archie crosses to the night stand where there is a pitcher of tomato juice. Because he has nothing else to do he sniffs the tomato juice,
PETULIA: ( to nurse ) This is Dr. Bollen of the Hospital. He's a splendid doctor, ( to Archie ) This is Agnes Lillywhite.
NURSE: Our young lady is doing nicely. We have a few problems, but nothing â¢ I get hiccups.` I go along merrily hiccupping for hours on end.
PETULIA: â¢ I get hiccups.` I go along merrily hiccupping for hours on end.
ARCHIE: Why did you leave the hospital?
PETULIA: I was feeling ever so much better, Archie. Mrs. Danner looks in. She is wearing an apron and stirring a batch of something.
MRS. DANNER: Will you be staying for lunch, sir? Goodness knows there's plenty of meatloaf. She goes and David enters. He looks extremely handsome. He wears white duck pants and a slip-over sweater. And a happy-go-lucky grin.
PETULIA: You two haven't met. ( to David ) This is Dr. Bollen.
85 CONTINUED: ( CHEERFULLY ) Yes, I thought so. Hello, there! David sees that Archie has no intention of shaking his hand, so he crosses to the bed and begins to playfully Drank Petulia up and down.
DAVID: ( CHEERFULLY ) Yes, I thought so. Hello, there! David sees that Archie has no intention of shaking his hand, so he crosses to the bed and begins to playfully Drank Petulia up and down.
ARCHIE: ( to Petulia ) I want you to go back to the hospital.
DAVID: Dr. Worthington says she's doing fine. He's going to make daily house calls.
PETULIA: He's very good about that.
ARCHIE: Petulia _mÂ® ! During this Mr. Danner has entered. He is really the only one not good at the charade.
PETULIA: ( CHEERFULLY ) Well, you're finally meeting our whole family.
MR. DANNER: Dr. Bollen, I wouldn't exactly call this good taste. Not to mention medical ethics.
DAVID: Dad, you old fuddy-duddy, things happen. Archie suspects he is having a nightmare. With the exception of Mr. Danner, he has never seen so many cheerful people in one place.
ARCHIE: ( to Petulia ) You told the policeman you had a dizzy spell.
PETULIA: Right. I fell on my bottom.
85 CONTINUED: 0 ARCHIE You were beaten up. You were somebody's punching bag.
0 ARCHIE: You were beaten up. You were somebody's punching bag.
MR. DANNER: won't have you cross-examining this Your son nearly killed this girl.
ARCHIE: Your son nearly killed this girl.
DAVID: ( FRIENDLY ) Hey now listen, doe, I'll stand still for only so much.
MR. DANNER: ( to the nurse ) I want you to remember what this man just said. ( to Archie ) Though it's none of your business, my boy was in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Looking at boats.
PETULIA: We've decided we're quite happy with the one we have.
DAVID: When Dad phoned me I was having dinner with a cousin of ours. Real mouth- watering Creole cooking. He and Petulia chuckle at each other as though this were some kind of private joke. Archie crosses to Petulia and just stands there looking at her. He doesn't know what to do.
PETULIA: ( HAPPILY ) I'm fine Archie. Except I burp a lot. Everybody gets dizzy spells. Archie looks incredulously from Petulia who has resumed brushing the nurse's hair; to David; to Mr. Danner who's obviously annoyed at Archie's bad taste; to Mrs. Danner who is in the dining room setting up an extra place for Archie. What can he do? Abruptly he rushes from the house.
PETULIA'S VOICE: Going back to the house was the only thing I could do.
PETULIA: ( CONTINUING ) Where else could I go? A lonely hotel room? I don't have a penny of my own. Mr. Danner promised me I'd never be left alone. I thought I'd try it for a few days. Don't be-angry. It was nobody's fault. Actually, if anyone is to blame, it's you, Archie.
ARCHIE: ( GASPING ) 87B INT. FAIRMONT HOTEL NIGHT Petulia now recreates the moment when she first met Archie. Archie is searching through his pockets for the ticket to reclaim his coat, Petulia rushes up to him, with none of the fake nonsense of the actual meeting, but with absolute desperation. Archie is dressed as he is on the hill ( Scene 86 ).
PETULIA: I'm Petulia Danner . save me like you saved Oliver . save me from David! Don't lust scramble up the hill like a â¢ b oody fool o
ARCHIE: I'm looking for the ticket for my raincoat.

PETULIA'S VOICE: ( CONTINUING ) 9 Why didn't you bring a proper ambulance? As though you really meant it.
ARCHIE'S VOICE: I didn't know what to do. I was going from one moment to the next.
PETULIA'S VOICE: Spectacular entrance, lousy exit. Sounds familiar, Archie. Suddenly all the anger goes out of Petulia.
PETULIA: I went back to the house because I owed it to David. I have a brown thumb when it comes to men. I put them on the Cross and call them Jesus. And there they hang. I don't know why I do it. Not because of any high opinion of myself. oh, Archie, if you only knew.
PETULIA: Look at him. Isn't he super. A six foot three Coca Cola bottle. Empty. I did that. I'd ruin you, Archie.
PETULIA'S VOICE: David was the gentlest man I ever knew.
Â¢: PETULIA'S VOICE I'd ruin you. In five weeks, I'd be running around with a black eye. By now, Archie has reached the top of the cliff and is a complete mess. He turns for one last look at the Danner house and the yacht beyond. He shakes his fist 89 EXT0 MUIR WOODS DAY During the following SEQUENCE OF SCENES Archie is trying to get back to normality. He's having a nice sensible talk with Warren Smith, Polo's fiance. It is a pleasant sunny day and a group of Indian boys are being told about the forest by an Irish guide. In the background Archie's two children are playing with Warren's child.

He's having a nice sensible talk with Warren Smith, Polo's fiance. It is a pleasant sunny day and a group of Indian boys are being told about the forest by an Irish guide. In the background Archie's two children are playing with Warren's child.
WARREN: It's never too soon to think of the boys' education. Warren winks at him knowingly.
ARCHIE: Have you thought of doing something about that?
89 CONTINUED: What ?
WARREN: What ?
ARCHIE: ; ; ^ ^ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½,, That twi Lch v v d.

ARCHIE: You do. Come and see me. Don't touch it, it'll give you a phobia. I'll fix it for free.
WARREN: Thanks, I will. You know, I like you more t han I ever thought I would.
ARCHIE: Warren, you're a beautiful human being. They turn to watch the boys at play. Nearby, the guide is explaining something to the Indians.
INDIAN CHILD: What happens next?

PETULIA: Feel marvelous. Michael and Stevie? Archie nods,
ARCHIE: We?-re going to see the penguins. Everything okay with your
PETULIA: Oh yes, fine. The cars start down their separate ways.

FIRST GENTLEMAN: Wonderful. i.sn g t - t ? They sell like hot cakes. Gives you something alive in all this stone.
ARCHIE: There must be some mistake. He sags down on a chair, draped in his research books. The two old gentlemen couldn't be more pleased.
FIRST GENTLEMAN: Mac and I get a, big kick out of people's first reaction. Its not a toy. It's a working greenhouse. You control heat and humidity with these. ( he indicates dials ) You've got a little bit of everything. Ornamental plants,, Zinnias, Asters. Even a little vegetable garden. The most important thing to remember is to keep the sun out. These new kind of lights work so much better, there's no comparison.

FIRST GENTLEMAN: Exactly. We've left a manual of operations, and wetll check everything out in a month. Okay, Dr. Bollen?
ARCHIE: ( still chuckling ) Okay, okay! Goodbye,' He enters the greenhouse, having to stoop almost double, as the two old gentlemen exit from the apartment.
Â¢: 97. EXT. DANNER HOUSE DAY Archiets car is parked on the cliff. The Danner house is dark, deserted, abandoned. Archie is standing by himself on the wharf bouquet in hand. The yacht has gone. And so has Petulia. Archie feels utterly alone, and as a matter of fact, he is. He tosses the bouquet into the water. The lettuce floats.
DAVID: Did you get mama on the plane all right?
PETULIA: Did you get mama on the plane all right?
DAVID: Sure. But what a dinky plane. Poor mamats stomach problems are far from over. He enters the cabin. Petulia sits up after a moment, looks about, sees no one else, then then in alarm peers into one
Â¢: 97B INT. CABIN David is stowing food into the refrigerator.
PETULIA: You didn't leave papa alone in that horrible little town?
DAVID: It's not such a horrible little town. ( he holds up a can ) Hearts of artichokes'
PETULIA: ( UNEASILY ) Take your "Vitamer Zed," you blinkint 0 97B Continued He uses the English way of saying "vitamin," and then a bit too rakishly he tosses an orange up through the window. Instinctively, Petulia makes an effort to catch, misses, and it hits her lightly on the shoulder. Though it causes no damage,'David is suddenly in terror. He races up out of the cabin to Petulia.

DAVID: Papa went with her at the last minute. Petulia REACTS, shocked.
DAVID: ( CONTINUING ) She was so pale and seared. They aren't even pressurized. The plane. You suck on a tube and hope it's oxygen.
S: During this he has peeled the orange and torn it into segments, which he now tries to feed her.
DAVID: How could he have gone? Just like that?
PETULIA: How could he have gone? Just like that?
DAVID: Where mama is concerned, papa is a very loving man. Open. Instead, Petulia jumps frightened to her feet, She seems about to leave the yacht.
DAVID: Please don't.
PETULIA: He Dromised;
DAVID: Honey. It'll be okay, Cross my heart.
0 PETULTA: He promised.
W OMAN: Hello there you gorgeous people. Everyone's invited for Margueritas and cha-cha-cha.
PETULIA: ( DAZEDLY ) Mr. and Mrs. Danner are gone,
WOMAN: ( a`s corny as this ) Oooh la la; Lucky you; The group goes off, toward their yacht. Petulia doesn't know what to do. David skims off his jeans and jackknifes into the water. The sun glints on his exquisite body. Confusedly, Petulia pops a segment of an orange into her mouth. David surfaces from the water laughing up at her. He looks great.
PETULIA: We didn't have to come back this early..
DAVID: You're still not one hundred per cent They've reached the cabin. He enters. She waits outside. Suddenly his hand is around her wrist, somewhat too hard, and in a gesture he hopes is playful, he pulls her down the steps into the cabin.
DAVID: Icy hands.
PETULIA: Warm heart.
DAVID: So they say, Petulia says nothing. She begins undressing,
DAVID: ( CONTINUING ) I didn't tell papa to leave. She doesn't answer.
DAVID: ( CONTINUING ) He only had the clothes on his back. She doesn't answer.
DAVID: ( CONTINUING ) I didn't.want him to leave.
PETULIA: All right, David.
DAVID: Only a crazy man hits a woman. Or a coward. T won't ever again. I'd stick my hand into a garbage disposal. I would, Petulia. I'd grind it up, Petulia lies under the sheet, silent, rigid, David abruptly crosses to a cabinet and takes out a signal flare pistol. He snaps in a flare and tosses it at Petulia. She sits up in panic.
DAVID: Hang on to it. If I come for you let me have a flare. Between the eyes. I'll melt in ten seconds. Petulia is touched.
DAVID: ( suddenly angry ) Girls are beautiful,

PETULIA: They can't keep any secrets around here.
ARCHIE: When did you get back?
PETULIA: A year ago. You didn't forget me,
ARCH IE: How could I? All those laughs. He dabs a Kleenex on her sweat-beaded face.
ARCHIE: So, Things go better with Mr. and Mrs. Danner,
PETULIA: They look at each other tenderly.
Â¢: Why did you let me get away?
PETULIA: Why did you let me get away?
ARCHIE: Bad timing. Dumb Archie.

NURSE: That wasn't four minutes. The nurse makes a note then turns her attention to another lady who must be wheeled to the Delivery Room,
PETULIA: I hurt. Touch it Archie. Make it hurt less. His hand touches her belly very gently.
PETULIA: 0 It doesn't help.
ARCHIE: You see?
PETULIA: But your hands were magic with Oliver.
ARCHIE: Her pain has subsided, and she looks up at Archie.
PETULIA: Would you really?
ARCHIE: You'd call an ambulance? At this late stage?
PETULIA: You'd call an ambulance? At this late stage?
ARCHIE: Say the word.
PETULIA: No. I'm different now. Damn it Archie, why did I go to that Motel with you?
PETULIA: ( CONTINUING ) Do you realize we were actually only a one night stand? We never even gave each other a cold, All we really did was pass each other going the other way. Have I changed you, Archie?
ARCHIE: You turned me into a nut.
PETULIA: Is that good?
ARCHIE: Yes, I think so, Who knows? I hope
PETULIA: Archie, call the ambulance. Archie crosses to the phone, picks up the receiver, then almost at once he puts it down again.
PETULIA: Hey, wait I lied.
ARCHIE: About what?
