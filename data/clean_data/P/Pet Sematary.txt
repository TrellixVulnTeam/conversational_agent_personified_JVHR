"PET SEMATARY": Stephen King
LOUIS: So.what do you think? RACHEL begins to smile. She turns to LOUIS and hugs him.
RACHEL: It's gorgeous!
ELLIE: Am I really gonna have my own room?
LOUIS: She looks toward the side lawn and sees a tire on a rope hanging down from the bough of a tree.
ELLIE: She looks toward the side lawn and sees a tire on a rope hanging down from the bough of a tree.
RACHEL: Yes, but the rope might be
ELLIE: She goes running toward it. RACHEL gives LOUIS a tired smile.
LOUIS: Let her go. It's cool.
RACHEL: Louis, the house is beautiful. They kissgently at first, then more passionately. As he draws her more tightly against him, a babyGAGEbegins to cry from the car. LOUIS and RACHEL break the clinch.
RACHEL: The Master of Disaster awakes. This SOUND is joined by the unhappy yowling of a pent-up tomcat.
LOUIS: And Buckaroo Banzai.
RACHEL: Come onlet's parole 'em. They walk to the car, RACHEL going to one of the back seat doors, LOUIS to the rear of the wagon.
RACHEL: Decided to wake up and see what home looks like, huh? She begins to unbuckle the straps and harnesses. GAGE is just wearing a t-shirt and a diaper. He's fifteen months old.
LOUIS: Ellie, you heard your m- His eyes widen.
ELLIE: SOUND: A heavy twang! as the rope breaks. The tire swingwith ELLIE still inside itgoes crashing to the grass. ELLIE screams and begins to crya little hurt and a lot surprised. LOUIS and RACHEL run to her.
ELLIE: Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
LOUIS: Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet looks like she just skinned her knee. Nevertheless, he begins to rapidly disentangle his daughter from the tire. RACHEL helps.
GAGE: GAGE bends down and tries to open the cat-carrier's door. No soap. Either he can't solve the latch or his fingers don't have the strength. Anyway, he stops trying after a moment. SOUND: Growing thunder of an approaching truck - a big one.
CHURCH: GAGE bends down and tries to open the cat-carrier's door. No soap. Either he can't solve the latch or his fingers don't have the strength. Anyway, he stops trying after a moment. SOUND: Growing thunder of an approaching truck - a big one.
GAGE: He starts down the driveway toward the road.
RACHEL: Gage's gone!
LOUIS: Jesus, the road! They get up together.
GAGE: JUD ( low ) No shit, Sherlock. JUD carries him up the driveway to the station wagon. Here he's joined by LOUIS and RACHEL, out of breath and really scared. ELLIE brings up the rear. She's still sniffling.
RACHEL: JUD ( hands him to her ) He was headed for the road, looked like. I corralled him for you, missus.
RACHEL: Thank you. Thank you so much.
LOUIS: Yesthanks. I'm Louis Creed. He sticks out his hand and JUD shakes it. LOUIS takes it easyno crushing JayCees grip, or anything like thatthe old guy looks as if he might have arthritis.
JUD: Jud Crandall. I live just across the road.
RACHEL: I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.
JUD: No harm, no foul. But you want to watch out for that road. Those damn trucks go back and forth all day and most of the He leans over toward ELLIE.
JUD: Who might you be, little Miss?
ELLIE: I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan. ( Pause ) At least, I used to.
JUD: And now you live on Route 9 in Ludlow, and your dad's gonna be the new doctor up to the college, I hear, and I think you're going to be just as happy as a clam here, Ellen Creed. Are clams really happy? They all laugheven GAGE.
RACHEL: Excuse me, Mr. CrandallI've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you.
JUD: Same here. Come over and visit when you get the chance. As RACHEL, carrying GAGE, moves away: Daddy, do I really have to have the stingy stuff?
LOUIS: No-I guess not.
ELLIE: She goes belting off.
JUD: House has stood empty for too long. It's damn good to see people in it again. SOUND: A truck engine, gearing down.
LOUIS: Heythey actually found the place!
JUD: Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want.
LOUIS: Well, maybe I Louis, what's this?
FIRST MOVER: You Mr. Creed?
LOUIS: Yes. Just a second.
LOUIS: The movers
RACHEL: YesI know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
LOUIS: I don't have the slightest idea. When I saw the house, this field was under four feet of snow. I bet Mr. Crandall knows! JUD nods. He smiles, too, but underneath the smile we sense that he is serious.
JUD: Oh, ayuh! I know. It's a good story, and a good walk, too. I'll take you up there sometime, and tell you the story, too after you get settled in. He smiles at them and they smile backit is a look of understanding and real liking, in spite of the age difference between the CREEDS and JUD.
LOUIS: He hugs her. She hugs him back warmlyfor a moment they are just two good people in all the big darkness of their new house.
RACHEL: You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you?
LOUIS: Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and-
RACHEL: -and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and-
LOUIS: Did you see his shirt? Sure. Bruce Springsteen.
LOUIS: I really do have a million questions about the area.but the thing I'm really curious about is how come this octogenarian Yankee is decorating the slumped remains of his pecs with the She laughs.
LOUIS: It's me.
JUD: Well, come on up and have a beer.
JUD: You need a glass?
LOUIS: Not at all.
JUD: Good for you. LOUIS drinks half the can at a draught.
LOUIS: God, that's fine.
JUD: Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
LOUIS: What were you listening to?
JUD: Allman Brothers.
LOUIS: The Eat A Peach album. God, they were good before drugs and bad luck caught up with them. Listen to this, Louis. He passes the headphones over. LOUIS puts them on. JUD presses the Walkman's PLAY button. SOUND: Ramblin' Man blasts us out of our seats. LOUIS winces and rakes the spidery earphones off his head.
JUD: The Eat A Peach album. God, they were good before drugs and bad luck caught up with them. Listen to this, Louis. He passes the headphones over. LOUIS puts them on. JUD presses the Walkman's PLAY button. SOUND: Ramblin' Man blasts us out of our seats. LOUIS winces and rakes the spidery earphones off his head.
JUD: I'm sorry. Wait. He turns it down.
JUD: Try that. LOUIS puts the earphones back on and listens for a few moments. It's the instrumental break. Gregg and Duane Allman dueling hot Fenders. LOUIS takes the earphones off.
LOUIS: I like rock and roll. No.I guess that's too mild. I love it. Since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music I can really hear. And since my wife died.I dunno, some- times a little rock and roll fills up night. Not always, but sometimes. ( Pause ) One more timewelcome to Ludlow. Hope your time here will be a happy one. Thank you, Mr. Crandall. He drinks againthey both do. There's a moment of companionable silence here, broken by the SOUND of a big truck. They look EXT/INT. THE ROAD ( THROUGH THE PORCH SCREEN ) One of those big tanker trucks goes rumbling bynow there are little amber running lights on top of it. It's going fast, too sweeps by in a blast of air.

LOUIS: The one that goes into the woodssure.
JUD: That roadand those Orinco trucks are the two main reasons it's there.
LOUIS: What's at the end of it? Another dayafter you get settled in a bit. Meantime, doc- Here JUD raises his glass in a toast. Here's to your bones. LOUIS clinks his glass against JUD'S.
LOUIS: And yours. They drink.
LOUIS: Church! God, you scared the life out of me!
CHURCH: LOUIS bends and picks up the cat. As he does, that truck SOUND comes again and he looks toward:
JUD: Take a look behind you. They turn around, and their faces express their wonder.
LOUIS: My God!
RACHEL: It's beautiful!
JUD: You folks ready to go on?
LOUIS: But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
ELLIE: But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
JUD: You'll see soon enough, hon. They go into the woods, still following the path.
LOUIS: Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands. Micmac, Ricmac, Kickmac, Sickmac. Ayuh, it's a funny word, ain't it? You tired of totin' that yowwen yet, doc?
JUD: Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands. Micmac, Ricmac, Kickmac, Sickmac. Ayuh, it's a funny word, ain't it? You tired of totin' that yowwen yet, doc?
LOUIS: Not yet.how much further is it?
JUD: Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile. He starts off again, fresh as a daisy. ELLIE scampers after him. LOUIS rolls his eyes at his wife and RACHEL rolls hers back. Then they press on.
ELLIE: What's it say, mommy? A strange expression has come over RACHEL'S faceshe doesn't like this. Not a bit.
RACHEL: It says Pet Cemetery, hon. It's misspelled, but.that's what it She runs for the arch. RACHEL starts; looks more uneasy than ever.
RACHEL: EXT. ELLIE She's almost under the arch. She looks back, questioning.
JUD: I told you it was a bad road, Louisit's killed a lot of pets and made a lot of kids unhappy. But at least something good come of it. This place. Mom! Dad! Y'oughtta see it!
RACHEL: How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children!
JUD: Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't quite that way, deah!
LOUIS: I think it's rather extraordinary.
RACHEL: Extraordinarily morbid, maybe. She's growing more and more upset. JUD looks at her curiously.
JUD: Well.they have to learn about death somehow, now don't they, Missus Creed? The little ones? Well.well, because Mommy! Daddy! Look at me!
JUD: Well.well, because Mommy! Daddy! Look at me!
ELLIE: It's okay, Mr. Crandall
LOUIS: Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?
ELLIE: Well, I thought it was safe
JUD: Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like this, Elliesometimes they bite.
ELLIE: EXT. RACHEL, STANDING AT THE ARCH Her discomfort makes one thing very clearshe doesn't want to come in.
JUD: EXT. RACHEL, STANDING AT THE ARCH Her discomfort makes one thing very clearshe doesn't want to come in.
ELLIE: I want to look around, daddy may I?
LOUIS: For a little while. JUD looks toward:
LOUIS: I can hardly read these.
JUD: Ayuhthey get older as you go toward the middle. ( Points ) Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there. ( points ) the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got.and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for Missy Ellen! Come over here just a EXT. ELLEN She runs amid the tombstonesthey have worked their way near to the center and there are quite a few of themand joins the I see you're quite a reader for such a little girl. Can you read that? He points again, and Ellen goes over for a look-see.
JUD: I see you're quite a reader for such a little girl. Can you read that? He points again, and Ellen goes over for a look-see.
ELLEN: "Spot a good fellow we love you boy." ( Pause ) "Owned by Judson.Judson." Gee, I can't read the rest.
JUD: Last name's Crandall, little missy. LOUIS looks at him sharply as ELLIE rejoins them.
JUD: That's where I buried my dog Spot when he died of old age in 19 and 14. Dug it good and deep. By the time I finished, I had blisters all over my hands and a hell of a crick in my back. Soil's stony up here. ELLIE looks awed. LOUIS looks a little awed, too. JUD sweeps a hand around, indicating the whole sematary, but is still looking at ELLEN.
JUD: Do you know what this place is, Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing and even a whole pile of 'em don't amount to much. Do you know what a graveyard really is?
ELLIE: Well.I guess not.
JUD: It's a place where the dead speak, He sees her startled, uneasy expression and laughs. He ruffles her hair reassuringly.
JUD: Nonot right out loud. Their stones speak.or their markers. Even if the marker ain't nothing but a tin can someone wrote on with a Magic Marker, it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis?
LOUIS: I think it is so, Ellie.
ELLIE: What if you can't read what's written on there anymore?
JUD: Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
ELLIE: And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot.
LOUIS: And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot.
ELLIE: To remember. Yes. To remember. This ain't a scary place, Ellie. It's a place of rest and speaking. Can you remember that? Yes, sir. They start to walk slowly back toward the arch.
ELLIE: Mommy! This is a place where dead animals talk! Mr. Crandall said so!
LOUIS: My wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind. As you may have noticed.
JUD: Me neither. But I believe in knowing your enemy. LOUIS looks at him, startled, then decides this is a joke. He laughs. JUD smiles, a trifle thinly.
ELLIE: Daddy, that Pet Sematary is there because of the road, isn't it? LOUIS looks around at her, surprised.
ELLIE: That's what I think. I heard Missy Dandridge tell Mom when Church was fixed he wouldn't cross the road so much.
LOUIS: Well, it's always better to take precautionsbut I'm sure Church will be all right, honey.
ELLIE: In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he?
LOUIS: Lovey.Church might be still alive when you're in a high school.and that's a very long time.
ELLIE: It doesn't seem long to me. It seems short. I think the whole thing about pets dying s-s-sucks! Poor kid's bawling her eyes out now. LOUIS folds her into his arms and she hugs him tightly, wanting his comfort.
LOUIS: If it was up to me I'd let Church live to be a hundred.but I don't make up the rules. Well who does? God, I suppose. But he's not God's cat! He's my cat! Let God get His own, if He wants one! Not mine! Not mine! Not She breaks down completely, sobbing, and LOUIS rocks her back and INT. THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE KITCHEN, WITH RACHEL She is crying silently.
RACHEL: She's finally asleep.
LOUIS: She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
RACHEL: It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.
LOUIS: Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
RACHEL: Do you think I didn't hear her tonight, crying as if her heart would break? Here she is thinking Church is going to It should be clear to us by now that, despite her words, RACHEL is much more upset than ELLIE was. LOUIS slowly puts his notebook aside and caps his pen.
LOUIS: Rachel.someday Church is going to That is hardly the point! Church is not going to die today, or tomorrow Never mind. I can see you don't have the slightest idea what I'm talking about. She stalks to the bathroom, which adjoins. LOUIS follows. She goes in and slams the door. He goes for the knob.
LOUIS: SOUND: CLICK OF THE LOCK. LOUIS stares at the door, bewildered and upset.
ELLIE: Yee-uck! Gross!
LOUIS: He can't help it, babe. Emily Post is going to be beyond him for a few years.
ELLIE: I don't want him to get his nuts cut, daddy! What if he dies?
LOUIS: Good God! Where'd you hear that?
ELLIE: Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a INT. RACHEL AND LOUIS, BY THE SINK LOUIS tries to kiss RACHEL'S mouth. She turns her head slightly so he gets her cheek instead. She's still mad. LOUIS'S amusement Honey, Church will be fine.
RACHEL: Honey, Church will be fine.
ELLIE: But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary?
RACHEL: Don't be silly. Church is not going to die.
LOUIS: According to what Mr. Crandall says, the road's a lot more dangerous than the operation. Church will be just the same. Wellalmost the sameand we won't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn Orinco At this RACHEL tightens up still more in that funny wayshe's actually angered by LOUIS'S reference to catburgersbut under the anger we sense she is deeply shocked, as a prudish woman might be shocked by a dirty joke. For RACHEL, that's just what death is.
RACHEL: That's enough of that kind of talk!
LOUIS: I just said
RACHEL: I know what you just said. Ellie, clear your place. ELLIE goes slowly back to the table. I'm scared. What if school here isn't like in Chicago! I'm scared and I want to go h-h-home! ELLIE bursts into loud tears and puts her hands over her face.
RACHEL: You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be excused. Go and wash your face.
LOUIS: And Church will be fine. Do you promise, Daddy?
LOUIS: Well, honey.you know that.
RACHEL: Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little girl her promise. Church will be fine. I promise.
ELLIE: She runs off, cheered up. And RACHEL is cheered up, too.
RACHEL: Thank you, Louis.
LOUIS: Oh, you're welcome. Only if some- thing should go wrong while he's under the gasit's a one-in-a-thousand shot, but it happensyou explain to her. He gets up and leaves the table. She looks after him, stunned and a little frightened.
RACHEL: Have a great day! LOUIS grabs GAGE'S hand and makes him wave it.
GAGE: EXT. THE BUS ELLIE climbs aboard. The red flashers go out and the bus pulls EXT. THE CREED DRIVEWAY MORNING The station wagon is parked there. LOUIS comes out with a heavy briefcase in one hand and the cat-carrier in the other. He opens the wagon's doorgate. A small car turns into the CREED driveway and parks beside LOUIS. A rather sour-looking middle-aged woman gets out and crosses the front of her car. Her color is bad. This is MISSY DANDRIDGE. She looks at the cat-carrier.
MISSY: Gonna get his
LOUIS: nuts cut, yes. Thank you, Missy, for introducing that colorful phrase into my daughter's vocabulary.
MISSY: Don't mention it. She opens the passenger side door of her car and we see a big neat pile of folded sheets. She reaches for them, then winces and presses her hands against her midriff for a moment, as if with an attack of indigestion. How's that belly-ache of yours? No better and no worse.
LOUIS: You ought to see a doctor about it.
MISSY: It'll pass. They always do. She starts toward the house with the sheets.
RACHEL: Thank God. I was a little worried there. Have a great first day at school, doc. No broken bones. Not so much as a sprain.
CHARLTON: Holy Jesus. Steve! Steve! Dr. Creed! Dr. Creed, we've got a mess here! Stat! The bearers sweep past her and inside, leaving a red smear of blood across the midriff of MARCY CHARLTON'S uniform.
GIRL: Vic! Vic! Oh Christ! Vic! Get her out. Get them all out. CHARLTON puts her arms around the girl. No! No! He can't die! He can't die! THE CAMERA MOVES BACK DOWN as LOUIS takes an opthalmascope from STEVE and shines it in PASCOW'S bulging, fixed eyes. CHARLTON is just pushing the last of them gawkers and bearers out the door.
LOUIS: Steve, get the ambulance over here right now. He's got to go to EMMC.
STEVE: The ambulance is at Sonny's Sunoco downtown, getting
LOUIS: a new muffler, oh shit PASCOW makes a weird gargling noise. Blood suddenly spurts out of his mouth. He begins to seizure. One of the candystripers shrieks. THE CAMERA JERKS UP TO COVER the student nurses. One turns and throws up on the wall. CHARLTON rushes over.
CANDYSTRIPER: I can't look at it.I can't stand it. Yes you by God can. Go get the hard As they start away, one helping the other down the hall, and as CHARLTON starts over to where PASCOW lies dying on his blanket,
LOUIS: Help me hold him. They hold PASCOW'S spasming body.
STEVE: It wouldn't matter if we did have the ambulance.
LOUIS: It wouldn't matter if we had the SST. PASCOW begins to quiet.
LOUIS: He's going. Steve, go call the motor- pool. Marcy, roll out the crash wagon.
CHARLTON: It won't
LOUIS: I know it won't! But let's for God's sake do it by the rules! She leaves. LOUIS is alone with PASCOW. CHARLTON has drawn the drapes, so the doctor and the dying man have complete if temporary INT. LOUIS AND PASCOW, A CLOSER SHOT There wasn't even supposed to be a sprain today, my friendthat's what I told her. PASCOW'S fixed eyes suddenly roll and his left hand bear-traps LOUIS'S right wrist. The dying man pulls him slowly but relentlessly down, until their faces are only inches apart.
LOIS: There wasn't even supposed to be a sprain today, my friendthat's what I told her. PASCOW'S fixed eyes suddenly roll and his left hand bear-traps LOUIS'S right wrist. The dying man pulls him slowly but relentlessly down, until their faces are only inches apart.
PASCOW: .Pet Sematary. LOUIS recoils, breaking the grip of the hand.but he cannot quite snap the grip of those bright dying eyes. Blood leaks from PASCOW'S mouth. W-What did you say.? PASCOW struggles hard to speak again. At first he can only gurgle.
PASCOW: It's not the real cemetery. ( Long pause ) The soil of a man's heart is stonier, Louis.a man grows what he can.and tends it. LOUIS leans forward again, terrified, yet needing to know.
LOUIS: How do you know my name? I'll come.to you. LOUIS grabs PASCOW'S bloody shoulder. Dammit, how do you know my name?
STEVE: Louis, they're sending a
LOUIS: Steve, will you get a sheet to cover him with? STEVE leaves the frame and LOUIS stares fixedly down at the body of VICTOR PASCOW. He closes the eyes.
LOUIS: He said my name. I heard it. He said my name. He stares blankly through the windshield.
PASCOW: Come on, doc. We got places to go.
PASCOW: Come on, docdon't make me tell you INT. LOUIS He glances at RACHEL. Although PASCOW has spoken in a fairly loud voiceand the opening door was like a bombshe's still fast asleep. LOUIS looks back toward PASCOW.and then gets out of bed. He's naked except for a pair of pajama bottoms.
PASCOW: Let's go, doc. I don't like this dream.
PASCOW: Who said you were dreaming? He begins to move toward the garage door. After a moment LOUIS follows him.
PASCOW: This is the place where the dead speak.
LOUIS: I want to wake up. I want to wake up, that's all. I
PASCOW: The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed. Don't go on, doc. No matter how much you feel you have to. There's more power here than you know. He points at:
LOUIS: Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in
PASCOW: The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
LOUIS: Leave me alone!
PASCOW: CAMERA IS TIGHT ON LOUIS. As the Ramones start blasting "Sheena Is A Punk Rocker":
LOUIS: Getting there.
RACHEL: I got eggs down here!
LOUIS: Good d He throws the covers back and freezes.
JUD: Did you tell me Rachel took the kids back to Chicago for a few days?
LOUIS: For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated.they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?
JUD: Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
LOUIS: Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.
LOUIS: It's Church.
JUD: I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
LOUIS: Ellie will, though. She'll suffer plenty. From his jacket pocket he takes a green plastic garbage bag and hands it to JUD. JUD holds the bag's mouth open on the ground while LOUIS kind of shoves the body in. During this:
JUD: Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?
LOUIS: LOUIS twists the bag shut and puts one of those plastic ties on it. Then he holds it up.
LOUIS: Bagged cat. What a mess.
JUD: You going to bury him in the Pet I guess that's what it's there for, huh? During all of this JUD has grown peculiarly intense.
JUD: Going to tell Ellie?
LOUIS: I don't know.
JUD: Seems like you told me about a promise you made
JUD: Cat's just as dead, Louis. Well that's a big help! ( Pause ) I'm sorry, Jud.
JUD: No need to apologize.
LOUIS: Maybe when they call I'll just tell Ellie I haven't seen the damn cat around. You know? Maybe there's a better way.
LOUIS: Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back.
JUD: It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it.and we're going to.
LOUIS: Does she love the cat?
JUD: Does she love the cat?
LOUIS: Yes, but
JUD: Then come on. He puts the earphones on, effectively forestalling further argument, and pushes the PLAY button on the Walkman. We can hear Marshall Crenshaw singing "Crystal Girl." JUD starts away. After a moment, LOUIS follows.
LOUIS: Well, folks, here we are, in Louis Creed Dreamland. JUD snaps off the Walkman and puts the earphones around his neck What say, Louis?
JUD: What say, Louis?
LOUIS: Nothing. ( Pause ) Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
JUD: We're still not where we're going. He walks past LOUIS and toward the deadfall. LOUIS follows.
LOUIS: What do you mean?
JUD: The place we're going is on the other side of that. He points at the deadfall.
LOUIS: We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks!
JUD: No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me.move easy.don't look down.and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
LOUIS: I'm not climbing that.
JUD: Give me the cat. I'll take care of it He holds out his hand and LOUIS sees the old man means exactly as he says. After a moment he says:
LOUIS: Let's go. JUD starts up one side of the deadfall, and in spite of its snarled tangles, he mounts as easily as a man climbing a flight of stairs. After a few second, LOUIS follows. Thank God my Blue Cross is paid up.
LOUIS: God, this is amazing!
JUD: Just don't stop and
LOUIS: And don't look down. Right. He continues.
JUD: Louis! You all right? LOUIS sits up groggily. His pants are torn. His sweatshirt is torn. His ankle is bleeding. Sure. I guess I just lost my happy thoughts for a second there. LOUIS gets slowly up and retrieves the bag, which is rather shredded nowand we can see catfur through some of the rents. I shouldn't have stopped.and it does bite. He whaps the flashlight against his palm a time or two and the light comes on. Satisfied, he shuts it off.
JUD: No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?
LOUIS: Yes. ( Pause ) Where are we going, Jud?
JUD: You'll see before long. Let's go. He starts off up the path. After a moment LOUIS follows, carrying the bag.
JUD: This next bit's like the deadfall, Louis you got to walk steady and easy. Just follow me and don't look down.
JUD: Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.
LOUIS: Is there quicksand?
JUD: LOUIS ( nervous; joking ) Are there ghosts? JUD looks at him expressionlessly.
JUD: JUD starts off, stepping to the first tussock. After a moment, LOUIS follows.
JUD: There's a lot of funny things down this way, Louis.
LOUIS: You're telling me.
LOUIS: It's funny, all right.
JUD: Just don't stop, Louis. You don't ever want to stop down here in Little God. ( Pause ) And you don't ever want to look behind you, whatever you hear.
JUD: Almost there, Louis.
LOUIS: You keep saying that.
JUD: This time I mean it. He tops the last step and stands on a rocky level under the stars, the wind blowing his hair off his deeply lined brow. A few moments later LOUIS joins him and stares with undisguised wonder.
JUD: This was their burying ground, Louis.
LOUIS: Whose burying ground?
JUD: The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.
LOUIS: Why? For God's sake, why?
JUD: I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right?
LOUIS: I guess so.but.
JUD: You want to rest a bit before you start?
LOUIS: No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.
JUD: Soil's thin, all right. But you'll manage. He hands him the pick and shovel.
JUD: I'm going to sit over yonder and have a smoke. I'd help you, but you've got to do it yourself. Each buries his own. That's how it was done then. JUD walks away, leaving LOUIS with the digging tools in one hand and the flashlight in the other. After a minute, LOUIS walks out into the burying ground.
LOUIS: You think so? He notices the rocks.
LOUIS: What are those for?
JUD: Your cairn.
LOUIS: Doesn't look like they last long.
JUD: Don't worry about that.
LOUIS: Jud, why am I doing all this?
JUD: Because it's right. He walks off again. LOUIS looks after him for a moment, then kneels down.
LOUIS: Pax vobiscum, Church old buddy. You were a hell of a god cat. I doubt if you were worth all this aggravation, but you were a hell of a good cat. He tumbles the bag containing the body into the grave, and then begins pushing the stony soil over it with the spade.
JUD: That's fine. You did real good. LOUIS looks at him.
LOUIS: Oh, shit! Rachel! He drops the tools and sprints.
JUD: When you talk to 'em, not one word about what we done tonight. 'S'far's you know, the cat's still fine.
JUD: You'll understand. In the meantime, keep your peace. What we did, Louis, was a secret thing. Women are supposed to be the ones who are good at keeping secrets, but any woman who knows anything at all would tell you she's never seen into a man's heart. The soil of a man's heart is stonier, Louislike the soil up there in the old Micmac burying ground. A man grows what he can.and tends it. During this, he's come across the room to LOUIS and dropped his hand on LOUIS'S shoulder.
LOUIS: No buts! Accept what's done, Louis. What we done was right. Another time it might not be, but tonight it was. at least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call.but not a word about tonight.
JUD: No buts! Accept what's done, Louis. What we done was right. Another time it might not be, but tonight it was. at least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call.but not a word about tonight.
LOUIS: Hi, Dory.it's Louis During this, another SOUND has been growing: an approaching truck. As JUD gains his side of the road, he looks back, and we read fear on his faceno matter what he said to LOUIS, he's sorry for tonight's piece of work. A moment later a highballing Orinco truck cuts between THE CAMERA and JUD.
LOUIS: That'd be real fine. Happy birthday to you/Happy birthday to you/Happy birthday, dear Ellie/Happy birthday to you! That was awful, daddy.
LOUIS: Yeah, I know.how are things out there in Chicagoland?
ELLIE: Fine.except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair. Way to go, Gage! I said that's too bad. What did you get for presents from Gramma and Grampa? Lots of stuff! I got two dresses.and a Chatty Cathy doll.
LOUIS: I said that's too bad. What did you get for presents from Gramma and Grampa? Lots of stuff! I got two dresses.and a Chatty Cathy doll.
ELLIE: .and a Garfield radio! How's Church, dad? Does he miss me?
LOUIS: Well.I guess he's just fine, Ellie. I haven't seen him this evening, but
ELLIE: Well, make sure you put him down cellar before you go to bed so he can't run out in the road and get greased. And kiss him goodnight for me. Yuck! Kiss your own cat!
ELLIE: Want to talk to Gage? Before he can answer, she puts the phone in GAGE'S hand. ELLIE and RACHEL watch, amused, as GAGE gobbles into it. Perhaps RACHEL encourages him to say a few words.
LOUIS: Food, Church.food! SOUND: Miaow.
LOUIS: Come on, Church! Chow down!
LOUIS: In a second. He tilts the cat's head back so he can get a look at CHURCH'S EXT. CHURCH'S NECK, CU ( LOUIS'S POV ) There's some sort of mark herea clear remnant of the crash. A line of white fur, or perhaps a dark red scar where no fur at all EXT. LOUIS AND CHURCH, ON THE STOOP LOUIS sees something else as he lets the cat's neck go. He tweezes something out of CHURCH'S whiskers.
LOUIS: Chewed his way out. Jesus Baldheaded Christ, he ch CHURCH suddenly claws at his face.
LOUIS: He claps his hand to his face. CHURCH leaps for the food. LOUIS slowly takes his hand away. There are claw marks on his cheek, welling blood. He looks at the cat.
LOUIS: What did we do?
JUD: I most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception.
LOUIS: What did we do, Jud?
JUD: Why, saved a little girl from being unhappy.that's all. Drink up, Louis! LOUIS drinks about half the beer.
LOUIS: I tried to tell myself I buried him alive. You knowEdgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat. But.
JUD: Wouldn't wash?
LOUIS: No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I see it, and Church was dead. He smells horrible and he uses his claws, but he's alive.and I feel like I'm going crazy. It was that place, wasn't it?
JUD: Ayuh. It was the rag-man told me about the placeStanley Bouchard. Us kids just called him Stanny B. He was half Micmac himself. LOUIS drains his beer.
LOUIS: Can I have another one?
JUD: I guess it wouldn't hurt. He gets up and goes to the fridge.
JUD: The Micmacs used to bury their dead up there long before the whites came. He returns to the table with the beer.
JUD: They buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried. Then something happened. Half the tribe died in a season. The rest moved on. They said a Wendigo had soured the ground.
LOUIS: Spirit of the north country. Not a good spirit. Wendigos are great liars and tricksters, according to the stories. And if one touches you. JUD pauses, perhaps a flustered, and gathers his thoughts.
JUD: Spirit of the north country. Not a good spirit. Wendigos are great liars and tricksters, according to the stories. And if one touches you. JUD pauses, perhaps a flustered, and gathers his thoughts.
JUD: Maybe it really was a Wendigo I ain't the one to say it wasn't or maybe it was just some disease. Whatever the reason, those that were left moved on. But they left that place.the way it is now. JUD shrugs, and drinks.
LOUIS: You and this old Indian rag-man
JUD: Stanny B. did for me what I did for you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't alone when Spot came back.
LOUIS: How did your mother take it, Jud? How did she take it when your dog came back from the dead? JUD'S face is a complication. He's lying to LOUIS, certainlybut is he also lying to himself? Yes, I think so.
JUD: Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night.you did, didn't you, Louis?
LOUIS: Why, then, things should be fine.
JUD: Why, then, things should be fine.
LOUIS: A little upset is all she was? Because I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown.
JUD: She got used to the idea. Spot lived another four years. He died peacefully in the night that second time, and I buried him in the Pet Sematary.where his bones still lie.
JUD: A man doesn't always know why he does things, Louis. I think I did it because your daughter ain't ready for her favorite pet to die.
LOUIS: Ellie's a little scared of death. And the main reason Ellie's that way is because your wife is a lot scared of death. Now you just go ahead and tell me I'm wrong. But LOUIS'S reaction tells him he's not wrongin fact, JUD has hit the nail right on the head.
JUD: Ellie's a little scared of death. And the main reason Ellie's that way is because your wife is a lot scared of death. Now you just go ahead and tell me I'm wrong. But LOUIS'S reaction tells him he's not wrongin fact, JUD has hit the nail right on the head.
RACHEL: Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little girl her promise.
PASCOW: The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed.
LOUIS: You don't understand
PASCOW: Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
LOUIS: INT. THE CREED KITCHEN TABLE To LOUIS, ELLIE, PASCOW, GAGE, and the corpse of SPOT enters JUD, his eyes shocked and staring.
LOUIS: How the hell did you get in? He may not know that, but he knows how it's going to get out. He opens the door to the upstairs hall. If CHURCH doesn't go at once, LOUIS helps it with his foot. Then he looks down at:
ELLIE: She runs for him.
LOUIS: Hi, sugar! She smacks him noisily. He smacks her back just as noisily.
ELLIE: Daddy, is Church all right? LOUIS'S face changes. All at once he's watchful.
LOUIS: Yes.I guess so. He was sleeping on the front porch when I left.
ELLIE: Cause I had a bad dream about him. I dreamed he got hit by a car and you and Mr. Crandall buried him in the Pet Sematary. That was a silly dream, wasn't it?
ELLIE: Is he really all right?
LOUIS: Because you promised.
ELLIE: Because you promised.
LOUIS: I know. RACHEL reaches them. She's pretty tired. Hair hanging in her face, good travelling clothes now looking a bit wrinkled and a bit Want to take your son, doc? LOUIS does. GAGE is ecstatic. LOUIS kisses RACHEL deeply.
RACHEL: Want to take your son, doc? LOUIS does. GAGE is ecstatic. LOUIS kisses RACHEL deeply.
RACHEL: Yesyou have to take them to someone who grooms animals, though. I think it's pretty expensive. I don't care. I'll save up my allowance and pay for it. Church smells bad.
LOUIS: I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up the money, Ellen.
ELLIE: I hate that smell.
LOUIS: YesI hate it, too. BLACK. And on it, a fourth title card: MISSY DANDRIDGE. SOUND: A pen scratching over paper.
ELLIE: They're all turning on their lights! Daddy, why are they all turning on their lights in the middle of the day? JUD, dressed in a rusty old black suit and a black tie, comes out and stands with them. He looks haggard and old.
JUD: They do it to honor the dead, Ellen.
ELLIE: Is that right, dad?
LOUIS: Yes. To honor the dead.
JUD: Rachel not feeling well?
LOUIS: Well.a touch of the flu.
ELLIE: She's in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said That's enough, Ellen. They've reached the CREED station wagon.
LOUIS: That's enough, Ellen. They've reached the CREED station wagon.
JUD: Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.
LOUIS: This babe has said enough. He opens the front passenger door.
LOUIS: Hop in, Ellie. She does, and LOUIS closes the door.
JUD: Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to hear. I remember when she was no older'n Ellen there, walking down to the store with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust. I don't know why God takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on and on.
LOUIS: My father used to have a saying, Jud "God sees the truth, but waits."
JUD: Ayuh.how is your cat, Louis?
LOUIS: It's Ellie's cat.
JUD: Nope. He's your cat now. JUD opens one of the back doors as LOUIS goes around to the driver's side.
LOUIS: Ellie? What's wrong?
ELLIE: No more chocolate chip cookies.
LOUIS: Missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the worldeven Mom said so. Now there won't be any more because she's gonna be dead forever! She cries harder. LOUIS reaches out and strokes her hair.
ELLIE: Missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the worldeven Mom said so. Now there won't be any more because she's gonna be dead forever! She cries harder. LOUIS reaches out and strokes her hair.
NEWSCASTER: Bizarre as it may seem, it now seems almost beyond doubt: the dead are returning to eat the living. INT. THE CREED LIVING ROOM NIGHT There's a VCR on top of the TV; LOUIS has been watching "Night." Now he quickly uses the remote control to shut down the TV. She's dressed for bed, and comes toward him slowly.
LOUIS: What's up, sugar?
ELLIE: Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven?
LOUIS: INT. THE KITCHEN, WITH RACHEL She's putting away the last of the supper things. She hears this and moves toward the living room door to listen. She doesn't look at all well. Her eyes are red from crying and her face is haggard.
ELLIE: At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.
LOUIS: Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear.
LOUIS: But don't you dare say that.
ELLIE: I won't.is Missy in heaven, do you I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children
LOUIS: I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children
ELLIE: Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose.
LOUIS: Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out.like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
ELLIE: Do you believe that? LOUIS looks toward:
LOUIS: I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah I have faith in that.
ELLIE: You believe in it.
LOUIS: Oh, faith's a little more than just INT. RACHEL, AT THE KITCHEN DOOR Listening intently.
ELLIE: I don't get it.
LOUIS: Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
ELLIE: Yeah, sure.
LOUIS: Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right? ELLIE'S giggling.
LOUIS: But we plan on that chair. We believe in that chair. And I plan on going on somehow as Louis Creed, after I die. I believe I will. You have faith in that.
LOUIS: Yes ma'am. Just like I have faith that it is now time for Ellen Creed to get ready for bed. So buzz. He gets her off his lap.
ELLIE: I'm not tired!
LOUIS: I'm sure you're not.
ELLIE: Then why do I have to go to bed?
LOUIS: Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz. She heads toward the stairs.
RACHEL: I heard you tonight.
LOUIS: I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised
RACHEL: That's not true. The subject scares me. Because of Zelda. LOUIS puts his book down and looks at her thoughtfully.
LOUIS: Your sister, I know. RACHEL sits down on the end of the bed. She's clasping her hands nervously together.
RACHEL: Sometimes you're so good with her, Louisso straight with herthat you make me ashamed of myself. LOUIS sits up and scoots down the bed to her. He tries to put an arm around her. She rejects itbut gently.
RACHEL: I'm sorry I couldn't go with you to Missy's funeral. And that I blew up when we went to that silly animal graveyard.
LOUIS: That's forgotten.
RACHEL: Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
LOUIS: Yes, I guess I do. He makes a place for her beside him and hugs her. They lie silently together for awhile, taking comfort from each other.
RACHEL: I'm going to try to do better.
LOUIS: You're doing fine.
GAGE: Go, dayee! They all laughJUD ruffles the kid's hair.
LOUIS: Hey, Gage!
GAGE: String! You're flying it, Gageyou got the hammer, my man!
LOUIS: String! You're flying it, Gageyou got the hammer, my man!
GAGE: Gage fline it?
LOUIS: Bet your boots. Look LOUIS puts his hands over GAGE'S hands and pulls them down.
LOUIS: Gage fline it!! Bet your ass, little hero. He kisses his son. They look up at:
GAGE: Gage fline it!! Bet your ass, little hero. He kisses his son. They look up at:
IRWIN: But there is no way he can express his outrage with mere words. As LOUIS sits staring numbly up at him, IRWIN punches him in the nose. LOUIS sprawls backward, falling out of the pew onto the INT. THE REAR OF THE CHAPEL, FEATURING RACHEL AND DORY RACHEL screams and starts forward. DORY pulls her back.
RACHEL: Louis! Daddy! Stop it! STOP IT!
IRWIN: How do you like that, you son of a bitch? I should have done it sooner! IRWIN punches him in the stomach. LOUIS "oofs" and doubles over.
IRWIN: How do you like that? How do LOUIS pushes the old man with both hands.
MARCY: Stop them. Right now. STEVE gets up and goes toward:
IRWIN: Come on! I'm ready for ya! I'll take y'apart! As LOUIS wades in, STEVE MASTERTON gets between them.at the last possible moment.
STEVE: Stop it! LOUIS swings. STEVE manages to block the punch with his body.
STEVE: Stop it! Jesus, what's wrong with you, Louis? It's your son's funeral, not a boxing match! That gets to LOUIS. He drops his fists. That stunned expression creeps over his face againthat look that says he doesn't have the slightest clue as to what's going on or how it could possibly have happened.
PASCOW: A man grows what he can.and tends it.
ELLIE: I want to fly it! Can I fly it now, In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his EXT. LOUIS AND GAGE This is the last moment of happiness in this man's lifeso let's make it very happy. As he and GAGE stare up at the kite: Jesus. Louis. I'm sorry
RACHEL: In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his EXT. LOUIS AND GAGE This is the last moment of happiness in this man's lifeso let's make it very happy. As he and GAGE stare up at the kite: Jesus. Louis. I'm sorry
IRWIN: I don't know what happened to me. Louis, please LOUIS brushes by him with no acknowledgement that IRWIN even exists. He kneels down slowly by the coffin and puts his head against it. I'm sorry, GageI'm so sorry, little hero.
ELLIE: It got away from him! That numb shit! Ellen Creed!
GAGE: Kite fline too fast! SOUND: The oncoming truck.
JUD: Don't let him go in the road, Louis! RACHEL looks; registers terrible alarm. Get him, Louis!
NO!!: EXT. GAGE BLARE OF THE AIR-HORN. A shadow falls over his face. There is an audible CLICK! and we FREEZE FRAME. What we have now is a tremen- dously winning photograph of a little boy, not quite two, with a ball of string in his hand.and a shadow lying across his face.
JUD: Your father-in-law packs a wallop, for an old guy. He and his wife gone back to Chicago?
LOUIS: No.squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie.
JUD: The swing door opens. They look toward:
JUD: What you got there, Ellie? At first she doesn't want to show him, but JUD is very kind. Why that's real nice.you pullin' him on a sled. Bet he liked that, didn't he? ELLIE nods. She is starting to cry. JUD is also leaking at the I used to pull 'im a lot. LOUIS, looking down at his hands, nods.
ELLIE: I'm going to carry this picture, Mr. Crandall, until God lets Gage come back. JUD reacts violently. And LOUIS looks up, dully curious.but hasn't the thought already passed through LOUIS'S mind? YesI think it has.
JUD: Ellie.God doesn't do things like that. I know you loved y'brother, but
ELLIE: He can if He wants to. He can do anything, just like Inspector Gadget on TV. But I have to keep things ready for him, that's what I think. I've got his picture and I'm going to sit in his chair
LOUIS: And I'm going to eat his breakfast cereal, too, even though it tastes like boogers. And.and. She bursts into tears.
ELLIE: And I'm going to eat his breakfast cereal, too, even though it tastes like boogers. And.and. She bursts into tears.
JUD: Louis, take care of your little girl.she needs you.
ELLIE: G'night daddy. He starts for the door.
ELLIE: God could take it back if He wanted to, couldn't He? If He really, really wanted to? Can I have faith in that?
LOUIS: YesI suppose you can. Good night, He steps out, closing the door.
JUD: I got you a fresh beer out of the fridge, Louis. He indicates the table, where there is indeed a fresh beer.
LOUIS: Jud, I buried my son today and I'm very tired. I wonder if we could just
JUD: You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis.
LOUIS: I'm thinking about going to bed. But he begins pouring the beer into a glass.
JUD: You never asked me if anyone had buried a person up there in the Micmac burying ground LOUIS'S hand jerks. Beer goes foaming across the kitchen table.
JUD: but I think the thought has crossed your mind.
LOUIS: Shit! Look at this mess!
JUD: Ayuhit's a mess, all right. As LOUIS goes to get a cloth to wipe up the mess:
JUD: I know the Micmacs thought it was a holy place.and then they thought it was a cursed place. That's why they moved on.
LOUIS: Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
JUD: And because the dead walked. LOUIS stops sopping and looks at him.
JUD: Oh, ayuh. It's been done. What you've been thinking of has been done.
LOUIS: I'll bitewhat's the bottom of the truth, Jud?
JUD: Why.that sometimes dead is better. That's all. Sometimes dead is better. Tell that to my wife and little girl.
JUD: It ain't your wife and little girl that's got me worried, Louis.
JUD: Come on. They start around to the back.
ALAN: Oh holy Jesus lookit that. BILL whirls around and sees them.
BILL: You men get out of here!
JUD: I heard your boy was killed down That was a mistake!
HANNIBAL: Was it?
BILL: You see him standing there, don't you? Now get out! Get the Christ off my land! Now TIMMY turns around and comes shambling forward. Ge ow! Ge Cwise off eye an! Oh Jesus, Jud! He's dead! I can smell him!
BILL: He ain't dead! Give him a day or two and he'll be fine! Don't you say that!
JUD: Bill, this ain't rightyou can see that yourself
JUD: God help you, Bill.
LOUIS: What happened?
JUD: Get out, Billythe place is going up. He walks away. BILL BATERMAN, wearing a strappy tee-shirt, looks out the window.
BILL: I seen you! I seen you, Jud Crandall!
ALAN: You think Bill's gonna get out, Jud? If he don't, he don't.
TIMMY: LOVE DEAD! HATE LIVING! And into the fire he goes, still shrieking and laughing.
LOUIS: You better get going, hon.
RACHEL: Oh Louis, I just don't know about I told you last nightthis can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
LOUIS: I told you last nightthis can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
RACHEL: Louis, are you sure?
LOUIS: I'm sure.
ELLIE: I don't want to go to Chicago, Gramma Dory.
DORY: Why not, darling?
ELLIE: I had a bad dream last night. A About what?
ELLIE: About Daddy. ( Pause ) And Gage. DORY and IRWIN exchange a knowing, sad glance over the child's And someone named Paxcow.
ELLIE: And someone named Paxcow.
LOUIS: Come on, you guysbefore you miss the boat. He kisses DORY. IRWIN hugs him.
IRWIN: Louis, I am sorry. What can I say? That I lost my mind? It's the truth, but no good excuse. We all lost our minds, Irwin. LOUIS kisses RACHEL. Then he kneels and hugs ELLIE.
LOUIS: Be good to your mother, darlin'. She needs you.
ELLIE: Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!
LOUIS: I'll be there in three daysfour at the most. I've got to get the electricity shut off and square things with your school so the truant officer ain't after you, and
LOUIS: Of what? I don't know. Everything's going to be all right, Ellie. Now go onget aboard.
ELLIE: Do you swear?
LOUIS: I swear. The Voice of Authority has spoken. We can tell by ELLIE'S face that while things are still not all right, they are a little better. She joins her mother. The four of themRACHEL, ELLIE, and THE GOLDMANSstart down the jetway. ELLIE looks back once, as if begging him to come.and then they're gone.
CLERK: Anything else for you today? I think we got it all. The CLERK starts to ring things up.
CLERK: Looks like heavy work.
LOUIS: It could be. The quality of LOUIS'S reply is somehow unnatural. The CLERK looks at him, momentarily unsure and uncertain. Then he starts ringing things up again.
ELLIE: Paxcow says it's almost too late!
RACHEL: Paxcow says it's almost too late! We have to go back! Paxcow says it's almost too late!
ELLIE: Paxcow says it's almost too late! We have to go back! Paxcow says it's almost too late!
LOUIS: It's wrong. ( Pause ) What happened to you is wrong.
PASCOW: The barrier was not meant to be crossed. The ground is sour.
LOUIS: I'll tell you where the ground is sourthe ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.
PASCOW: Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
LOUIS: Don't talk like an asshole even if you are just a bit of underdone potato or a blot of mustard.
LOUIS: If it doesn't workif he comes back like Timmy BatermanI'll put him to sleep. But I'm going to try. ( Pause ) And if it doesn't work.they don't ever need to know.
ELLIE: Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something really bad. He
RACHEL: Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost. RACHEL turns off the bed-lamp.
ELLIE: He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost. RACHEL turns off the bed-lamp.
RACHEL: There are no ghosts, Ellie. I want you to go to sleep and forget all this Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?
ELLIE: Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?
RACHEL: Of course I will. She kisses ELLIE.
RACHEL: Now will you try to go to sleep? Yes, Mom. RACHEL gets up and leaves the room.
PASCOW: RACHEL suddenly straightens. She looks startled and afraid.
RACHEL: Pascow? Was she saying Pascow? She suddenly heads for the stairs, fast.
RACHEL: He's not home.
DORY: Why, he probably went out for a hamburger or a chicken dinner, dear. You know how men are when they're alone. Good old IRWIN'S face says that maybe LOUIS went out for a couple of grams of coke and a whore in Nazi SS boots. RACHEL is dialing another number.
RACHEL: It's Rachel Creed, Jud. I'm calling from Chicago. Chicago! Is Louis with you?
RACHEL: No.we're going to be here awhile, and he wanted a few days to wind up our affairs there. I just wondered if he was with you.
JUD: Nobut if he drops by, I'll tell him to call you.
RACHEL: Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car? I don't
RACHEL: Was it Pascow?
JUD: Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to
RACHEL: Don't bother. I'm coming home. Thank you, Jud. Goodbye. She hangs up.
RACHEL: Thank you, Jud. Goodbye. She hangs up.
JUD: No! Rachel! Don't do that! The buzz of an open line. Connection broken. JUD slowly replaces the receiver. The man looks very grim.
DORY: Rachel.darling.you're upset. a night's sleep.
RACHEL: I have to go. The connections are tight, and I have to be at O'Hare in forty minutes. Will you drive me, You know something's wrong, don't you? You know. And Ellie does, too.
IRWIN: You know something's wrong, don't you? You know. And Ellie does, too.
RACHEL: I'll drive you. They all turn to:
IRWIN: I'll drive you. They all turn to:
ELLIE: Please hurry.
RACHEL: I will. Come and kiss me. ELLIE races into her arms.
IRWIN: I'll come with you if you want, I've got three planes to catch and I got the last seats on two of them. It's like God saved them for me.
JUD: You done it, you stupid old man. now you got to undo it. He puts his earphones on. Cracks a beer. Lights a cigarette. Pushes the PLAY button on the deck. Faint SOUNDS of The Clash buzz-sawing "Rock The Casbah." JUD begins to watch.
SEATMATE: Think you'll make your connection in Boston?
RACHEL: I have to.
LOUIS: Oh, Gageoh, honey.
LOUIS: It's going to be all right.I swear it's going to be all right. The canvas tarp has been spread open to the right. LOUIS begins to lay his son down on it.
COP: I ain't afraid of no ghost. He walks back to his cruiser, gets in, and hauls ass.
PASCOW: There's just time. If you run. Without looking at PASCOW, RACHEL takes off her shoes and runs.
PASCOW: Don't do that, babe. The GATE AGENT looks puzzled, as if she just had a thought ( or maybe a gas pain ). She stops closing the door. RACHEL runs into the area. She sees:
RACHEL: Make it come back!
PASCOW: You're doing just fine.
LOUIS: Please Godlet this work. He sets off.
LOUIS: Ain't gonna stop, Gage. Ain't gonna look down. He begins to mount the deadfall.
HERTZ CLERK: I'm sorry.it's been very busy tonight. I really don't have What about the Aries K with the scratch on the side? The CLERK starts looking through her papers.
PASCOW: What about the Aries K with the scratch on the side? The CLERK starts looking through her papers.
CLERK: I do have an Aries K, but it came in sort of beat upthere's a long scrape up one side
RACHEL: I'll take it.
LOUIS: See? Just imagination. Just
LOUIS: He turns around and begins to walk again.
LOUIS: It was the Wendigo. Dear God, I think the Wendigo just passed within sixty feet of me. Slowly he begins to walk again.
LOUIS: It doesn't matter. Come on, Gage. He starts to walk again.
RACHEL: Now what? PASCOW comes from around the tree as RACHEL walks to the road, looking for cars, or something. He looks urgent and upset.
PASCOW: It's trying to stop you. Do you hear me? It's trying to stop you. RACHEL looks around uncertainly.a little afraid. As she scans the scene she looks atand throughPASCOW.
RACHEL: Is anyone there? After a moment of silence she turns back to the road. Lights appear and brighten as a car approaches. RACHEL steps to the shoulder and after a moment she sticks out her thumb, surely for the first time in her life. The car sweeps by her without slowing.
LOUIS: Come back to me, Gage. Come back to us. He turns away toward the stairs.
DRIVER: Hop in, baby.
RACHEL: Thank you. She does.
RACHEL: Can't you go any faster?
TRUCKER: Lady, I got nine points on my license right now.
RACHEL: I understand. It's just that She looks at him, pleading. The TRUCKER speeds up.
RACHEL: Thank you. If you only understood how important this is
TRUCKER: That's all right, babe. Only if we get stopped, next time I'll be the one hitchin' and you can give me a EXT. JUD, ON HIS PORCH More deeply asleep than ever. Suddenly, from inside, comes the sound of Quiet Riot singing/screaming "Bang Your Head." It's the stereo, and boy, is it cranked. JUD straightens up so suddenly he almost falls off his chair. His hands go first to his earphoneshis first thought on waking is that it's coming from thereand then he hurries inside. CAMERA PANS DOWN to small muddy tracks on the porch floor.
JUD: Come on, stop playing games! SOUND: Molly Hatchet, "Flirtin' with Disaster," being played top end, from upstairs. JUD hurries up. Let me suggest that there is a certain psychology at work herefor the moment he's more concerned about waking the neighborhood with all this high-decible rock and roll than with the prowler.and he would certainly know whoor whatthat prowler was, if he had time to think.
JUD: Gage? ( Pause ) Are you the one playing games? He goes to the window and looks out at:
JUD: Gage? Come on out. He reaches in his pocket and brings out a pocket-knife. He unfolds the blade.
JUD: I want to show you something. SOUND: Miaow!
RACHEL: Thank you so much.
TRUCKER: I didn't get a ticket, so you're welcome, lady. Whatever your problems are, I hope they work out.
PASCOW: It's the end of the line for me, tooI'm not allowed any further. I'm sure things will be fine.
PASCOW: I'm not. She closes the door and steps down. The truck starts off with a HISS OF RELEASED AIRBRAKES. As it pulls past her, RACHEL starts across the road, when: She stops, startled. Her face wears a "did I hear that?" expression. She looks back toward JUD'S house. RACHEL walks halfway up JUD'S paved walk and looks at:
RACHEL: The door to the house swings open. After a moment CHURCH comes into the doorway and sits down.
CHURCH: GAGE ( voice ) Mummy, I need you! She crosses to the open door.
RACHEL: GAGE ( voice ) Mummy, I need you! She crosses to the open door.
RACHEL: Gage? Gage? No answer. RACHEL steps in.
LOUIS: He starts to get up very slowly, and this his eyes fix on:
LOUIS: He scrambles for the closet, his aches and pains forgotten. He stares in wildly.
LOUIS: Oh my God. ( Pause ) Gage!
LOUIS: LOUIS stands there, tensely listening, for a moment or two, but there's only silence. He rushes down the hallway and opens the door to GAGE'S room.
LOUIS: IRWIN ( voice ) Hello, Louisit's Irwin. I just wanted to be sure Rachel got back all right. As IRWIN says this, LOUIS'S eyes fix upon something.
LOUIS: Yes, she's fine. Well, put her on at that end and I'll put Ellie on at this one. Ellie's very worried about her mother. ( Pause ) She's almost in hysterics.
LOUIS: She.Rachel's asleep. Then I suggest you wake her up. Ellie.I think she had a dream that her mother was dead.
LOUIS: I'll call you right back. But LOUIS, whose last few responses have been almost trancelike, hangs up. He looks at the tracks, then goes into the parlor.
LOUIS: Irwin, you'll just have to I'm at Jud's, daddy. Will you come over and play with me? LOUIS is dumbfounded.slack-mouthed with terror. Mommy already came. We played, daddy. First I played with Jud and then mommy came and I played with mommy. We had an awful good time. Now I want to play with you. GAGE begins to giggle.a really awful sound.
LOUIS: What did you do? What did you CLICK! The GAGE-THING hangs up, still giggling.
LOUIS: What you buy is what you own, and sooner or later what you own comes home to you. Wasn't that what you said, Jud? Wasn't that pretty much it? He leaves the room.
LOUIS: Hi, Church. Want some grub? He tosses the pork chop onto the grass.
LOUIS: Don't mind me. Eat it while you can. Eat all you want.
LOUIS: Eat all you can.all you want. that's right.today's Thanksgiving day for cats, but only if they came back from the dead. He finishes with the gloves, gets one of the loaded syringes out of his breast pocket, holds it up, squirts a drop out of the tip, then moves toward CHURCH. CHURCH looks up. LOUIS stops moving. CHURCH starts eating again, and LOUIS starts moving again as soon as he does. All the time he talks to the cat in that soothing voice. He bends down.and grabs CHURCH begins to squall and fight. LOUIS holds onto him. He tries to get the syringe into the cat and CHURCH almost gets away.
LOUIS: No, you don't!
LOUIS: Go on. Lie down. Play dead. Be dead. He walks to the porch steps and picks up the tote-bag.
LOUIS: Rachel? ( Pause ) Jud? ( Longer pause ) No answer. He looks down and sees:
LOUIS: INT. THE STAIRS
LOUIS: All right, Gage.let's. He begins to climb the stairs.
LOUIS: I'm sorry, Jud. I'm so sorry. I'm There's a SQUEAKING, SQUEALING SOUND. LOUIS turns around. He gets up again. He starts for the door. Then he turns back and speaks to JUD again.
LOUIS: I'm going to set things back in order. I.I know just what to do. He goes out.
LOUIS: Another SQUEAKING SOUND. And another GIGGLE. LOUIS starts slowly forward. He gets about halfway down the hall and our nerves are tuned to the breaking pointwhen there is a SQUEALING CREAK and a GRATING THUMP from overhead.
GAGE: No fair! NO FAIR! He gets to his feet, clawing for the needle lolling out of his neck. He's lost all interest in his father. He goes staggering away. He's slowing down. He goes to his knees.and falls on his LOUIS watches this. and then his vacant, half-catatonic gaze goes to:
LOUIS: And what you own always comes home to you. He flips up one card. TOLLING CONTINUES: Eight.
