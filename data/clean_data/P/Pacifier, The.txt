SERBIAN 1: Something must be below us! Shoot! Shoot!
SHANE: Lieutenant Shane Wolfe, United States Navy. I'm gonna get you outta here. But you have to do exactly what I say, when I say it. My way no highway option. Do you copy? Where's the briefcase?
PLUMMER: How did you know where I.
SEAL: KEEP SHOOTING!
KEEP SHOOTING!: The Guards fire again. The SEAL speaks into his neck mic.
SHANE: ( into his mic ) I've got the Prof and the case. First round's on me back at Virginia Beach.
SHANE: Hold on.
SHANE: You know how to swim?
PLUMMER: Oh my God. I can't believe you. how'd we. That was the most incredible.
SHANE: Better keep that on `til we get to the rendezvous point.
PLUMMER: ( through the mouth piece ) Why? Poison gas?
SHANE: ( re: the oxygen ) No. I'm just not big on chit chat.
CHARLES: Lieutenant, thank you. ( He pats his briefcase ) You saved more than just my life today. Can I call my wife to let her know I'm okay?
SHANE: Negative. Not imperative to the mission. We have to keep moving. I have strict orders to get you out of here safely.
CHARLES: I'm safe, Lieutenant. Please. She thinks I'm dead. ( then ) Don't you have a family?
SHANE: ( this gets him: ) Make it quick.
CHARLES: Joe, Todd, Lulu, Peter, Tyler.
SHANE: Charles takes a cell-phone out of the case. Shane looks in the case: it's EMPTY, except for the phone and a family PHOTO. Charles dials his cell phone. nothing

SHANE: Captain, sir.
BILL: As you were Lieutenant.
SHANE: . I know sir. And I except full responsibility for the mission's failure.
BILL: Why the hell did you let him use the satellite phone?
SHANE: He had to call his family. A lapse in judgement on my part that I regret sir.
BILL: . Plummer was the best security expert the department of defense ever had a genius. He was working on a program that scrambles launch codes. He called it G.H.O.S.T.: Guided High-altitude Scrambling Transmitter. One pulse from the GHOST satellite and a country can't launch its own nukes. That's what the Serbians kidnapped him for, but they couldn't get S
SHANE: The case was empty sir, as I stated in my
BILL: Not a surprise, really. Not like the professor to hide things where someone might look for them. G.H.O.S.T. is still out there, ( Bill smiles: ) which is why I'm going to give you another shot.
SHANE: Sir. Thank you. I. appreciate your
BILL: ( interrupting: ) Negative. It's not that kind of mission.
SHANE: That's it? Why would you want me for that, sir.
BILL: The professor's wife requested you.

SHANE: ( official: ) Ma'am. Baby.
JULIE: Kids, go finish your homework. And I'll be checking.
SHANE: You have a pleasant family, ma'am.
JULIE: Charles wasn't around too much. His work took him all over the world. He'd be gone six or seven months at a time. So I think for the younger ones it's a little confusing. Zoe and Todd. well, they're dealing like your normal teenagers. Maybe in Todd's case semi-normal.
SHANE: Mrs. Plummer, I have to tell you that I did everything I could.
JULIE: Charles was in a dangerous business. I knew it when I married him. No one's to blame here. Everyone thinks that Charles told me or the kids where he hid it. And until G.H.O.S.T. is found, we're all in danger.
SHANE: Nothing will happen to your family as long as I'm here. I've dealt with much.
JULIE: That's Gary. He was Charles'.
SHANE: Mrs. Plummer-

ZOE: Mom we'll be fine, chill.
JULIE: ( a little choked up: ) I know, it's just. I am a mom, it's my job to worry. . I love you guys. I'm gonna miss you. I'll be back in 48 hours. And guys, whatever Lieutenant Wolfe asks you to do. do it. Okay?
A: ll the children nod in agreement except Zoe who pops her chewing gum bubble.

LULU: Do you copy?

LULU: ( "copying" him ) What? I said do you.
SHANE: Do not copy me!
ULU: Make up your mind.

P: eter farted.
SHANE: Tracking devices. Now that I know I can't trust you. Never take them off. The panic button is only for emergencies. Touch that you better be dying, or you're dead.
ZOE: I am not wearing that. Just because my mom's paranoid doesn't mean we have to take orders from you.

TODD: He's coming back-
HELGA: BUMP! BUMP! BUMP! She flies down the greased stairs, BANGING her head and ass on each step, all the way down.

LULU: We're gonna be late.
SHANE: Not on my watch.

PRINCIPAL CLAIRE: If I catch anyone on the team fighting again, next week's tournament is off. I don't care who starts it.

MURNEY: Pretty slick, Frogman I'm a black belt myself. S'why they asked me to coach the wrestling team.

S: Shane grimaces. He holds his breath, and goes down for the diaper. He disappears under the balls for a long time. The Manager and the Brownies share a concerned look. He's still down there. Silence.
LULU: Should we send someone in after him?
SHANE: Clear out! GO GO GO!
SHANE: Party's over.
SHANE: No one leaves until this house is spotless! I want to be able to eat off the floor! The latrine! Hell, I wanna be able to eat in the kitchen!!
SCOTT: This is officially the worst party ever.
ZOE: It was YOUR idea! I don't even know most of these losers.
ZOE: . Thanks a lot, Rambo. My friends will never come here again.
SHANE: Those people aren't your friends. They show no respect for you or your house. Because you have no respect for yourself.
ZOE: I do too respect myself.
SHANE: You got barf on your tank top. ( Announces: ) Company, downstairs!
ZOE: You're not my dad!
SHANE: You're right, Red 1. I'm not the man for this job.
LULU: Shane !
SHANE: In all my years I have never been treated with such disrespect. Not even from the enemy. Don't worry, as soon as your mom comes back, I'm gone.

TODD: Who were they? What did they want.?
SHANE: They're looking for a program, that your father invented.

SHANE: No - it's okay. They're gone, everyone's fine. They were looking for GHOST, but they didn't find it. You have any luck?
JULIE: Well, yes and no. We found something in the box. But we're not sure what it is. Bill thinks it's part of the GHOST. It looks like some kind of "key". We just don't know what its for.
SHANE: ( very genuine ) .So soon? We were just starting to have fun. Don't worry we'll be just fine.
SHANE: I gotta warn you guys: From now on, I'm gonna be sticking even closer.
SECOND GRADERS: Ooooooooh! ( You're in trouble! )

MURNEY: That? Lady drivers, what do you expect. No, it's not that it's the boy.
SHANE: Red two? I mean Todd?
PRINCIPAL CLAIRE: Ordinarily I would wait for his mother to return. but I'm a bit concerned, and I'm not sure what to do.
SHANE: Has he been skipping class?
PRINCIPAL CLAIRE: Well yes. He does always miss sixth period. But this.
MURNEY: This is how he showed up to practice. And that's not all. I was doing a little re- con in his locker. and I found this:
SHANE: He's not a NAZI.
PRINCIPAL CLAIRE: It's certainly not normal. See if you can talk to the boy. Find out what's going on.
MURNEY: hope you won't go light on him that whole family's no good, if you ask me.
SHANE: I'll talk to him.
