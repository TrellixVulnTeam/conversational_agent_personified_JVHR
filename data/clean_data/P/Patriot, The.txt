THE PATRIOT: Robert Rodat
SOUTH CAROLINA: April, 1776 Upstream, the swamps. Beautiful. Hundreds of BIRDS SING. Shafts of sunlight pierce the canopy, cutting through the hanging moss and kudzu, falling onto soft, swaying ferns covering the high ground. The water is clear, with fields of floating lily pads, each with a stark white flower rising from it.
TRUE STORY: EXT. POND BLUFF - DAY A farm built between the banks of the river and the deep green of the swamps. Good, fertile land, hacked out of the wilderness. The perfectly tended fields are ripe with barley, hops, alfalfa and tobacco. Two sturdy brothers, NATHAN, 13 and SAMUEL, 12, work one of the fields, rhythmically swinging scythes through the barley. The house, built of native brick, is well-constructed and well-maintained. There's a barn, a workshop and a forge. It is a home of substance rather than wealth. On the front porch, MARGARET, 11, pumps a butter churn while her brother, WILLIAM, 6, watches. GABRIEL, 18, strong and handsome, walks out of the woods with a musket in his hand and a dozen game-birds over his shoulder. At his side walks THOMAS, 14, also carrying a INT. WORKSHOP - DAY A perfect colonial workshop, fastidiously arranged with every conceivable tool of the period. A foot-powered lathe. A drop-forge. A lifting saw. Racks of tools, planes, hammers, augers, drills, blocks, all hanging in their places. All very well-worn. FRANCIS MARION methodically works his lathe, turning a piece of hardwood, shaving off tiny curls of wood with a razor-sharp chisel. He's in his late-forties, strong and weathered. His hands, though big and callused, handle the chisel with a surgeon's precision. Self-educated and self-sufficient, he has built himself, as he built his farm, brick by brick, from the coarse clay of the earth. A finely-made rocking chair, missing only the dowel on which Marion is working, sits on the work table. The chair is a work of art, thin and light, a spider-web of perfectly turned wood, no nails, no glue. Sitting on the woodpile, SUSAN, 4, a silent, stone-face wisp of a child, watches her father. Marion takes the piece of wood out of the lathe, carefully fits it into the chair, inserts a peg and taps it into place. Then he steps back and appraises his handiwork. He picks up the chair and hooks the top rail to a scale, countering with a three-pound weight. The chair floats. Marion blows softly on the weight which sinks. Susan nods, so far, so good. Marion puts the chair on the floor and walks slowly around it, checking every angle. Then, the acid test. He takes a deep breath and lowers himself onto the seat, gingerly adding an ounce at a time. Not a creak. He smiles and sits back with a sigh. CRACK! THE CHAIR SPLINTERS under Marion's weight, DUMPING HIM on his ass on a pile of broken wood.
MARION: He picks up some of the wood, about to fling it across the room but stops as Susan shoots him a disapproving look. He calms himself.
MARION: Susan gets down from the woodpile and puts the remains of the chair in the fireplace. As she climbs back up to her perch, Marion steps over to his wood rack, extracts a fresh dowel, fits it into the lathe and starts all over END CREDITS. EXT. WORKSHOP - DUSK Marion leaves the workshop with Susan at his side. Nathan and Samuel walk past, exhausted from their day in the
NATHAN: Father, I saw a post rider at the Thank you. Did you finish the upper We got it all cut and we bundled half of it.
MARION: Thank you. Did you finish the upper We got it all cut and we bundled half of it.
SAMUEL: We got it all cut and we bundled half of it.
MARION: Those swimming breaks cut into the day, don't they? Marion walks on without waiting for a reply from his contrite sons who jostle one another, trying to pass off the blame. Gabriel and Thomas walk out of the barn.
GABRIEL: Father, a post rider came from Charleston. You have a letter Thank you. How's the spotted one's Better. She's near ready to calve. Marion nods and motions for Susan to go with Gabriel and Thomas to the house. She does so and Marion walks on alone toward:
MARION: Thank you. How's the spotted one's Better. She's near ready to calve. Marion nods and motions for Susan to go with Gabriel and Thomas to the house. She does so and Marion walks on alone toward:
THOMAS: Better. She's near ready to calve. Marion nods and motions for Susan to go with Gabriel and Thomas to the house. She does so and Marion walks on alone toward:
MARION: . and they bundled half. almost no trace of the boys you knew. A soft wind blows some dry leaves along the ground. Marion pauses as if listening to a spoken reply.
MARION: . no, she still hasn't spoken. Margaret was her age when you. I remember the time at the river when we couldn't find Catherine. you couldn't stop crying. and she was asleep in the wagon the entire Marion pauses, remembering. The CRASH OF A PLATE BREAKING, followed by the SOUND OF AN ARGUMENT rises from the house below. Marion shakes his head with an exasperated sigh.
MARION: Your children. He heads down the hill toward the house, now glowing from the lights of candles and oil lamps.
MARION: I smell turnips.
WILLIAM: Father, Samuel broke the blue I did not.
SAMUEL: I did not.
MARGARET: Marion hands the apples to Abigail and steps over to open his mail and dispatches.
GABRIEL: News of Boston, father?
NATHAN: I hate turnips.
SAMUEL: William knocked it right out of my Samuel, William, both of you clean it up. Marion hands a packet of pamphlets to Gabriel and opens a The Assembly has been reconvened, I've been called to. Marion's children go wild.
GABRIEL: Samuel, William, both of you clean it up. Marion hands a packet of pamphlets to Gabriel and opens a The Assembly has been reconvened, I've been called to. Marion's children go wild.
MARION: Samuel, William, both of you clean it up. Marion hands a packet of pamphlets to Gabriel and opens a The Assembly has been reconvened, I've been called to. Marion's children go wild.
MARION: The Assembly has been reconvened, I've been called to. Marion's children go wild.
MARGARET: We're going to Charleston!
NATHAN: We're going to Charleston!
SAMUEL: When, father, when?
MARION: We'll leave tomorrow. The children ERUPT INTO CHEERS and THUNDER into the dining Charleston! We're going to Marion and Gabriel exchange a stone-faced look. Then Marion puts on a smile and inhales deeply.
THE CHILDREN: Charleston! We're going to Marion and Gabriel exchange a stone-faced look. Then Marion puts on a smile and inhales deeply.
MARION: I love turnips. Marion follows his children into the dining room.
MARGARET: . now count five finger lengths up from the front two stars of the Big Dipper, and that's the North Star, that's her. Susan gazes up at the North Star. The girls notice Marion and climb into bed. He puts a chair against Susan's bed and kisses her. He pulls a blanket up around Margaret, who whispers:
MARGARET: It helps her to know Mother's there. Marion nods with a thin smile, kisses Margaret and walks INT. MARION'S STUDY - NIGHT Squadrons of lead soldiers stand ready for battle as Thomas, lying on the floor, deploys his men. Gabriel reads the new pamphlets and broadsides. Marion walks in and pours a drink. Gabriel hands several of the pamphlets to his father.
GABRIEL: The New York and Rhode Island assemblies have been dissolved.
MARION: The middle colonies?
GABRIEL: Rioting both sides of the bay, in Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the Customs Agent. He died of burns. In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats.
MARION: Anything about the convention in Poor Richard says they'll make a Declaration of Independence by July. Marion shakes his head and sits down, carefully extracting a delicate pair of reading glasses from a wooden box. He begins reading.
GABRIEL: Poor Richard says they'll make a Declaration of Independence by July. Marion shakes his head and sits down, carefully extracting a delicate pair of reading glasses from a wooden box. He begins reading.
GABRIEL: Scott Higgins joined the militia. Marion hears but doesn't respond. Thomas looks up from his lead soldiers.
GABRIEL: He's seventeen. A year younger than
THE CHILDREN: Aunt Charlotte! Aunt Charlotte!
CHARLOTTE: Welcome! Welcome! Margaret, William, look at you.! They're huge. What have you been feeding them?
MARION: They're from good stock on their mother's side.
CHARLOTTE: Thank you. Charlotte hustles the children toward the door.
CHARLOTTE: Come, come, inside, wait until you see what I have.
THE CHILDREN: ( simultaneous ) Presents! For me? What do you Inside, inside. Charlotte sweeps past Marion who smiles and follows her into the house.
CHARLOTTE: Inside, inside. Charlotte sweeps past Marion who smiles and follows her into the house.
MARION: You look well, Charlotte.
CHARLOTTE: As do you. Suddenly Thomas and Samuel race through the doorway, forcing Marion and Charlotte together, their bodies close. They step back and exchange warm but uneasy smiles. The moment is broken by the SOUND OF CHILDREN. Marion and Charlotte gratefully turn their attention back to them.
MARION: Inside, all of you. The children turn to Marion with stricken expressions. Marion relents.
MARION: Very well. The children turn back to the mob. Marion joins them.
THOMAS: Look! There's Gabriel! They see Gabriel making his way through the crowd. He sees them and waves, then enters the house. A moment later Charlotte steps out onto the balcony and IN THE SQUARE, a pair of drunk Sons of Liberty, pull down one of the smoldering effigies, cut off its head, then start hacking at it's groin with a sword. Appalled, Charlotte shoots a glare at Marion and snaps at the children.
CHARLOTTE: Children, inside! All of you! Right now. The children start to protest, but a glance at Charlotte's resolute expression makes them think better of it. They file into the house. Charlotte shoots a glare at Marion and shoos the children inside. Gabriel steps out and joins them.
MARION: What news?
GABRIEL: The British army is barricaded in Boston. Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.
MARION: Is that why the Assembly was Yes. He seeks a levy of troops and And the Governor?
GABRIEL: Yes. He seeks a levy of troops and And the Governor?
MARION: And the Governor?
GABRIEL: He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body.
MARION: Which would force our delegates in Philadelphia to vote for And send us to war alongside Our governor is a bigger fool than I Lee is counting on your vote and expects you to be the first to Marion nods thoughtfully without revealing what he thinks of Lee's expectations. Marion turns back to watch the EXT. ASSEMBLY HALL - CHARLESTON - DAY The capital building of South Carolina. A large crowd of lower-class men and women is massed in front of the Assembly Hall. As well-dressed Assemblymen walk into the building, the CROWD YELLS words of encouragement to some and berates others. In the square in front of the Assembly Hall a squadron of blue-uniformed AMERICAN CONTINENTAL SOLDIERS drills. A recruiting table is being set up by a Continental Captain and several military clerks. Marion and Gabriel walk across the square toward the Assembly Hall. As they push their way through the crowd, Gabriel eyes the Continentals.

SPEAKER: ORDER! ORDER! Slowly, the room quiets down.
SPEAKER: Our first order of business.
SIMMS: And out last if we vote a levy. The ROOM ERUPTS.
SPEAKER: ORDER! ORDER! Mr. Simms, you do not have the floor. The ROOM SETTLES DOWN.
SPEAKER: Our first order of business is an address by Colonel Harry Lee of the Continental Army. An imposing figure rises and makes his way to the front of the assembly. He's COLONEL HARRY LEE, about Marion's age and cut from the same cloth strong, weathered, with a powerful bearing. The room quiets down. Lee sees Marion and offers a familiar nod, which Marion returns, stone-faced. Then Lee speaks, simply and You all know why I am here. I am not an orator and I will not try to convince you of the worthiness of our cause. I am a soldier and we are at war and with the declaration of independence we all expect from Philadelphia, it will soon be a formal state of war. In preparation for that, eight of the thirteen colonies have levied money in support of a Continental Army. I ask South Carolina to be the ninth.

In preparation for that, eight of the thirteen colonies have levied money in support of a Continental Army. I ask South Carolina to be the ninth.
SIMMS: Colonel Lee, Massachusetts may be at war, along with New Hampshire and Rhode Island and Virginia, but South Carolina is not at war.
LEE: Massachusetts and New Hampshire are not as far from South Carolina as you might think and the war they're fighting is not for independence of one or two colonies. It's for the independence of a nation.
WITHINGTON: And what nation is that? Robinson, one of the Patriots, stands up.
ROBINSON: An American nation. Colonel Lee, with your permission?
LEE: Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists. It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested. We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.

We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
LEE: Thank you. Were I an orator, those are the exact words I would have Laughter. Marion rises.
MARION: Mister Robinson, tell me, why should I trade one tyrant, three thousand miles away, for three thousand tyrants, one mile away? Laughter from the Loyalists. Surprise from Lee and the Patriots. In the gallery, Gabriel winces.
ROBINSON: An elected legislature can trample a man's rights just as easily as a King can.
MARION: An elected legislature can trample a man's rights just as easily as a King can.
LEE: Captain Marion, I understood you to be a Patriot.
MARION: It's Mister Marion.
LEE: I understood him to be a Patriot as More laughter.
MARION: If you mean by a Patriot, am I angry at the Townsend Acts and the Stamp Act? Then I'm a Patriot. And what of the Navigation Act? Should I be permitted to sell my tobacco to the French traders on Martinique? Yes, and it's an intrusion into my affairs that I can't. legally. And what of the greedy, self-serving bastards who sit as Magistrates on the Admiralty Court and have fined nearly every man in this room. Should they be boxed about the ears and thrown onto the first ship back to England? I'll do it myself. And do I believe that the American colonies should stand as a separate, independent nation, free from the reins of King and Parliament? I do, and if that makes a Patriot, then I'm a Patriot. Marion grows more serious.
MARION: And what of the greedy, self-serving bastards who sit as Magistrates on the Admiralty Court and have fined nearly every man in this room.

And do I believe that the American colonies should stand as a separate, independent nation, free from the reins of King and Parliament? I do, and if that makes a Patriot, then I'm a Patriot. Marion grows more serious.
MARION: But if you're asking whether I'm willing to go to war with England, the answer is, no. I've been to war and I have no desire to do so again. The room is quiet, the Assemblymen having been thrown off- balance. Gabriel is stunned and disappointed by his father's speech.
ROBINSON: This from the same Captain Francis Marion whose anger was so famous during the Wilderness Campaign. Marion glares at Robinson, then smiles.
MARION: I was intemperate in my youth. My departed wife, God bless her soul, dampened that intemperance with the mantle of responsibility. Robinson looks derisively at Marion.
ROBINSON: Temperance can be a convenient disguise for fear. Marion bristles but before he can answer, Lee steps in.
LEE: Mister Robinson, I fought with Captain Marion in the French and Indian War, including the Wilderness Campaign. We served as scouts under Washington and I have no doubts about Captain Marion's courage or competence on a battlefield. There's not a man in this room, or anywhere, for that matter, to whom I would more willingly trust my life.
ROBINSON: I stand corrected.
LEE: Nonetheless, I would like to know, Mister Marion, how. how. how. Lee's oratorical skills peter out.
LEE: Damn it, Francis! How in God's name do you expect to gain independence without going to war?
MARION: Harry, Harry, Harry. Marion and Lee drop all formality and become nothing more than two old friends, pissed off.
LEE: My hairy arse! You live in a cave if you think we'll get independence without war. The Speaker POUNDS HIS GAVEL.
SPEAKER: Gentlemen! Please! This is not a Wasn't it a Union Jack we fought A long time ago.
MARION: Wasn't it a Union Jack we fought A long time ago.
LEE: A long time ago.
MARION: Thirteen years.
LEE: That's a damn long time. The Speaker POUNDS HIS GAVEL again.
SPEAKER: Gentlemen! Please! Marion and Lee ignore the speaker.
MARION: You were an Englishman then.
LEE: I was an American, I just didn't know it yet. The astonished Assemblymen and now even the Speaker watch the argument avidly, turning their heads in simultaneous anticipation of each rejoinder.
MARION: We don't have to go to war to gain There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal.
LEE: There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal.
MARION: There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal.
LEE: Name five hundred.
MARION: Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, That's five, keep going.
LEE: That's five, keep going.
MARION: . time, royal succession, regicide, bribery.
LEE: You said bribery twice. Marion speaks slowly and firmly.
MARION: We do not have to go to war to gain Lee says nothing for a moment, then he speaks more seriously, quietly, grimly.
LEE: Francis, I was at Bunker Hill. It was as bad as anything you and I saw on the frontier. Worse than the slaughter at the Ashuelot River. The British advanced three times and we killed over seven hundred of them at point blank range. And still, they advanced and they took the ground. That is the measure of their resolve. If your principles dictate independence, then war is the only way. It has come to that. Marion is silent for a long moment. He softens, finds himself unsteady and speaks far more honestly than he ever wanted to.
MARION: I have seven children. My wife is dead. Who's to care for them if I go to war? Lee is stunned by Marion's honesty and his show of weakness. At first Lee has no answer, then:
LEE: Wars are not fought only by childless men. A man must weigh his personal responsibilities against his principles.
MARION: That's what I'm doing. I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead.
LEE: And your principles?
MARION: I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles. The other Assemblymen, both Patriots and Loyalists, stare at him, appalled. Marion, feeling weak, sits down. Lee looks at his friend with more sympathy than disappointment. Then Lee turns to Robinson who addresses the chair.
ROBINSON: Mister Speaker, I call for a vote on a levy to the Continental Army.
HAMILL: So moved. The vote is taken on a roll call. Gabriel watches from the gallery.
SPEAKER: So moved. The vote is taken on a roll call. Gabriel watches from the gallery.
SPEAKER: Mr. Robinson.
ROBINSON: Mr. Hamill.
SPEAKER: Mr. Hamill.
HAMILL: Mr. Johnson.
SPEAKER: Mr. Johnson.
JOHNSON: Mr. Simms.
SPEAKER: Mr. Simms.
SIMMS: Mr. Marion. No response.
SPEAKER: Mr. Marion. No response.
SPEAKER: Mr. Marion.
MARION: In the gallery Gabriel turns and walks out. The roll call continues. Marion sits, eyes straight ahead.
PAGE BOY: Twenty-eight to twelve, the levy The Continental Captain motions to an assembled squadron. They raise their muskets and FIRE A VOLLEY into the air. Other soldiers, STRIKE UP A MARTIAL AIR ON FIFES AND DRUMS. Volunteers crowd around the recruiting table, YELLING and jostling for position. The delegates walk out. Both Patriots and Loyalists give Marion a wide berth. Marion sees Gabriel, standing near the crowd at the recruiting table. Marion walks up to him.
GABRIEL: Father, I've lost respect for you. I thought you were a man of When you have children, I hope you'll understand.
MARION: When you have children, I hope you'll understand.
GABRIEL: When I have children, I hope I don't hide behind them. Marion looks closely at Gabriel.
MARION: Do you intend to enlist without my They lock eyes for a moment, then Gabriel turns from his father and walks away, joining the crush around the recruiting table. Marion stands alone in the middle of the chaos. The FIFES AND DRUMS continue to play. Marion doesn't hear them. Harry Lee walks out of the Assembly hall with a triumphant group of Patriots who look at Marion coldly. Lee excuses himself, and steps over next to Marion. Lee sees that Marion is watching Gabriel at the enlistment One of yours?

LEE: I recognize him now. Is he as imprudent as his father was at his No, thank the Lord. He's more like his mother.
MARION: No, thank the Lord. He's more like his mother.
LEE: I'll see to it that he serves under Thank you. They shake hands. Then Lee walks over to the soldiers. Marion takes a last look at Gabriel, then heads off through the crowded square, moving against the tide of men headed toward the recruiting table.
MARION: Thank you. They shake hands. Then Lee walks over to the soldiers. Marion takes a last look at Gabriel, then heads off through the crowded square, moving against the tide of men headed toward the recruiting table.
MARION: Not yet, Thomas.
THOMAS: Marion looks closely at his son, giving him the courtesy of really thinking about the answer.
MARION: But it's already been two years and that's two more years. The war could be over by then.
THOMAS: But it's already been two years and that's two more years. The war could be over by then.
MARION: God willing. Thomas considers it, then nods.
THOMAS: Alright. Seventeen. Marion offers his hand. They shake firmly, like adults. Marion takes the coat off Thomas and puts it back in the trunk. They walk down the stairs together.
WILLIAM: Is it going to rain?
THOMAS: That's not thunder. The SOUND BECOMES DEEPER, MORE OMINOUS. They all notice the change.
NATHAN: Six-pounders. Lots of them.
MARION: Six-pounders. Lots of them.
MARGARET: How far away?
MARION: Four, five miles.
SAMUEL: Just east of it.
MARION: Just east of it.
MARGARET: Are we safe here? Marion puts on a smile.
MARION: Don't worry.
MARGARET: We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm. She's to the west.
MARION: No, there'll be skirmishers on the roads. We're safer here. Thomas appears at the doorway with a pair of muskets. He gives one to Nathan and offers the other to his father.
MARION: Put those away.
THOMAS: But father, they might come this Put them away. Reluctantly, Thomas takes the muskets back into the house.
MARION: Put them away. Reluctantly, Thomas takes the muskets back into the house.
MARION: Enough. I'll be in the workshop. Samuel, the cows. Thomas, attend to your studies here on the porch. Nathan, on the back porch. If you see anyone, come get me. Margaret, please keep William close to you. No one is to go past the yard wall. They all nod. Marion walks off toward the workshop, followed by Susan. The others hesitate.
MARION: They head off to do as they were told.
MARGARET: He doesn't respond. Margaret, trailed by William, walks down toward Samuel.
MARGARET: Samuel, get up to the house. You heard father. Then she sees it, too. The pale pink is turning redder and redder. And then the BODIES. First one, then more, many more. Torn apart. Missing limbs. Those with wide- open wounds, are already drained of blood. Others are still seeping, leaving trails of deep red in the paler red of the surrounding water. Samuel, Margaret and William stand frozen, appalled and MARION steps out of the workshop and sees the children at the river. He can't see what they're looking at. Irritated, he walks toward them. Then, as he nears the river, he sees the color of the water and the bodies that have hypnotized his children. He quickens his stride, speaking calmly but firmly, careful not to frighten them.
MARION: Up to the house, now. All of you, come on. Now.
SAMUEL: They're going to come.
MARGARET: We're going to have to fight them Father will do that.
SAMUEL: We're going to have to fight them Father will do that.
WILLIAM: Father will do that.
SAMUEL: They'll probably kill us men and do Lord knows what to you women.
MARGARET: A SOUND. They all stop. Something moved behind the kitchen. Margaret silently eases the others out of the room, through the darkened hall toward their father.
MARION: Gabriel is wounded, battered and dirty. He carries a musket and a dispatch case. He sways. Marion catches him and eases him to a seat.
MARGARET: You're hurt.
THOMAS: The battle, were you there?
MARION: Margaret, get bandages and water. Thomas, the porch, eyes open. Marion checks Gabriel's wounds which are nasty but not Have you seen any Redcoats?
GABRIEL: Have you seen any Redcoats?
MARION: Not yet. What happened? Margaret brings water and linen to Marion who expertly cleans Gabriel's wounds and applies field-dressings.
GABRIEL: It wasn't like Saratoga. There, we stayed in the trees, but this time Gates marched us straight at the Redcoats. They fired two volleys into us and we broke like straw. I was given these dispatches. I saw Virginia Regulars surrender. as they laid down their weapons the British Green Dragoons rode into them and hacked them to bits. killed them all, over two hundred Marion's appalled.
MARION: They had surrendered? Gabriel nods. Marion's stunned. Gabriel tries to rise.
GABRIEL: I have to get these dispatches to You're in no condition to ride.
MARION: You're in no condition to ride.
GABRIEL: I have no choice, I. Gabriel passes out. Marion catches him and carries him to a day-bed in the parlor. As Marion lays him down, they hear HEAVY MUSKET FIRE, VERY CLOSE. Marion hurries to the door and looks out into the night, the children cluster around him, seeing a strange sight.
MARION: Margaret, take William and Susan down to the root cellar. Thomas, go to the back porch. Nathan and Samuel, the side windows. Keep out of sight. They hurry off. Marion steps into the house and opens his gun cabinet. He extracts two pistols and a pair of muskets. Then he steps back to the front door. He waits and watches.
MARION: He's dead. Marion moves on to another.
MARION: Thomas, help me turn him over. They turn over a young Continental and see a horrible wound on his back. Thomas, swoons.
MARION: A hard glare from Marion strengthens his son. Together they bandage the wounded man.
CONTINENTAL SERGEANT: Thank you. Marion nods, uncomfortable with the thanks.
MARION: Sergeant, there are seventeen wounded men here. Seven Redcoats and ten Patriots, counting my son inside. That puts me in a difficult The Continental Sergeant knows what's coming. The Privates and Marion's children don't.
MARION: You three are the least severely wounded. I have to ask you to leave and find care elsewhere. The Privates are stunned at the request. The Sergeant looks at Marion's children and nods.
SERGEANT: I understand. He struggles to his feet and jerks his head for the two Privates to do the same.
SERGEANT: Come on, boys. Nathan, Samuel and Margaret are confused.
THOMAS: But they're wounded.
NATHAN: But they're wounded.
MARION: There are rules, even in war. Marion motions to a large, old scar on his arm.
MARION: After the Battle of Ashuelot River, against the French, I got this and the one on my leg. I couldn't walk. Washington had to march north. He left me with other wounded men and a like number of French prisoners. Nine for nine. When the French found us, their surgeon gave me the best of care. We'll be safe this Marion's children are not convinced. The Sergeant and the two Privates gather themselves to leave.
MARION: Your best chance is in Bennington, seven miles east, along the river The wounded men nod grimly and start off down the road.
MARION: Thank you. Marion and his children watch them go.
TARLETON: You're surrendering.
CONTINENTAL SERGEANT: Yes, sir.
TARLETON: What unit?
CONTINENTAL SERGEANT: First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
TARLETON: Who cared for your wounds? They hesitate.
CONTINENTAL SERGEANT: We did.
TARLETON: With a lace table cloth? Tarleton turns to his second-in-command, MAJOR WILKINS.
TARLETON: Kill them. Tarleton rides off. Wilkins and several other Dragoons calmly FIRE THEIR PISTOLS, killing the three Patriots. The troops ride off, thundering past the bodies of the three men.
REDCOAT LIEUTENANT: These men are of my regiment. Thank Marion nods. ONE OF THE REDCOATS emerges from the house carrying Gabriel's dispatch case.
REDCOAT: Rebel dispatches, sir. Gabriel steps up.
GABRIEL: I carried those. I was wounded, these people gave me care, they have nothing to do with the dispatches.
REDCOAT LIEUTENANT: I understand. The SOUND OF HORSES HOOVES. All turn and see:
TARLETON: Lieutenant, have a detachment take our wounded to our surgeons at Camden crossing. Use whatever horses and wagons you can find here.
REDCOAT LIEUTENANT: Yes, sir. He hands the dispatch case to Tarleton.
REDCOAT LIEUTENANT: We found this, sir. Tarleton opens it and quickly scans the contents.
TARLETON: Who carried this?
GABRIEL: I did.
TARLETON: ( to Lt. re: Gabriel ) Take this one to Camden, he's a spy. He will be hung. Marion quickly steps between Tarleton and Gabriel.
MARION: Colonel, he's a dispatch rider and that's a marked dispatch case. Tarleton ignores Marion and continues speaking to the Fire the house and barns.
TARLETON: Fire the house and barns.
REDCOAT LIEUTENANT: Yes, sir.
MARION: REDCOAT LIEUTENANT And the Rebel wounded?
REDCOAT LIEUTENANT: And the Rebel wounded?
TARLETON: Kill them. The Redcoat Lieutenant and several of his men are shocked by the order. Marion is, also, but he's more concerned with Gabriel. He pushes past some Redcoats and stands at Tarleton's mount, looking up.
MARION: A dispatch rider with a marked case cannot be held for spying. Tarleton finally pays attention to Marion. He looks down at his anguished face and offers the barest of smiles.
TARLETON: We're not going to hold him, we're going to hang him.
MARION: Tarleton draws his pistol and points it at Marion. Gabriel tries to intercede but is held back by a burly Redcoat Corporal.
GABRIEL: Oh, he's your son. You should have taught him about loyalty.
TARLETON: Oh, he's your son. You should have taught him about loyalty.
MARION: Colonel, I beg you, please reconsider. By the rules of war, a dispatch rider with a marked case. Tarleton controls his shifting mount, keeping his pistol trained on Marion's face.
TARLETON: Would you like a lesson in the rules of war? Marion doesn't answer. He looks up at Tarleton coldly, taking his measure, waiting to see if he's going to pull the trigger. Tarleton walks his horse a couple of steps and shifts his aim, pointing the pistol among Marion's children.
TARLETON: Perhaps your children would. The children are terrified. Thomas is more angry than frightened. Marion quickly steps between the pistol and his children and speaks quietly to Tarleton.
MARION: No lesson is necessary. Tarleton sees the terrified expressions on the faces of Marion's children. He smiles at the effect. Then he holsters his pistol. Marion and his children watch as one of the Redcoats ties Gabriel's hands. Thomas is beside himself.
THOMAS: Father, do something. Thomas grows increasingly agitated. He sees that his father is going to do nothing. He gauges the distance between Gabriel and the cover of the nearby woods. Then suddenly, Thomas SPRINGS. He RUNS, THROWING HIMSELF, into the two Redcoats holding Gabriel, KNOCKING THEM DOWN.
THOMAS: Gabriel! Run! Gabriel is too shocked to take flight. A few of the Redcoats, including one of the ones knocked down, shake their heads with sad laughter at Thomas' ineffectual gesture. One of them grabs Thomas by the scruff of the neck and yanks him to his feet. TARLETON sees the commotion. Without pausing he DRAWS HIS
TARLETON: Tarleton spurs his horse and rides off without looking back. His GREEN DRAGOONS THUNDER after him. MARION'S CHILDREN begin to cry. Margaret tries to revive Thomas' lifeless body, gently caressing his cheek.
MARGARET: Thomas, please, Thomas. The Redcoats watch in silence. MARION LOOKS AT GABRIEL and turns to the Redcoat Lieutenant.
MARION: Lieutenant, please. The Lieutenant wavers, but he looks after the departing Tarleton and his resolve stiffens. He turns coldly to I have my orders. Sergeant! The Redcoat infantrymen scatter, some to get horses and wagons from the barn, others to torch the buildings. MARION stands among the children, all of whom look to Marion with pleading eyes, waiting for him to do Papa, look what they did to Father, they're going to take With stone-faced fury, Marion watches the Redcoats do their work. From the barns, they hear the sounds of MUSKETS FIRING and the SQUEALS OF THE LIVESTOCK being killed. Other REDCOATS TORCH THE HOUSE, BARN AND OUTBUILDINGS.

NATHAN: Father, you can't let them take MARION AND THE CHILDREN Watch as the Redcoats form up and move out, leading Gabriel on a tether. Gabriel looks back helplessly but a hard jerk on the rope by one of the Redcoats turns him around. They disappear around a bend in the road. THE INSTANT THE REDCOATS ARE OUT OF SIGHT, MARION speaks firmly to his weeping children.

Gabriel looks back helplessly but a hard jerk on the rope by one of the Redcoats turns him around. They disappear around a bend in the road. THE INSTANT THE REDCOATS ARE OUT OF SIGHT, MARION speaks firmly to his weeping children.
MARION: Don't move. MARION STRIDES to his front door and ENTERS THE BURNING
MARION: Nathan, Samuel. Without breaking stride, Marion throws muskets to Nathan and Samuel who catch them.
MARION: Margaret, take William and Susan to the river shed. Hide there. If we're not back by dawn, go up the river to the Richardson's house. They'll take you to your Aunt Charlotte's farm. Nathan, Samuel, and I are going to get Gabriel.
MARGARET: But what about Thomas?
MARION: Leave him. Take care of William and Marion runs off toward the woods, Nathan and Samuel follow. Margaret hesitates, then herds William and Susan toward the river. The house is enveloped in flames.
MARION: Nathan, there. Samuel, there. The boys go where they're told.
MARION: I'll fire first. Then, Nathan, kill whoever is standing closest to Gabriel. Samuel, kill the last man in the line. They stagger under the weight of the orders. Marion notices but continues.
MARION: After that, Samuel, load for Nathan. If something happens to me, put down your weapons and run as fast as you can, that way, downhill. Hide in the brush by the river, then make your way home, get the others and go to Aunt Charlotte's farm. The boys hesitate. Marion looks at them firmly.
MARION: Boys. steady.
REDCOAT SERGEANT: FORM BY TWOS! BACK-TO-BACK LINES. MARION KILLS the Sergeant with a shot to the throat. Samuel finishes reloading, swaps muskets with Nathan who
REDCOAT CORPORAL: Marion FIRES, killing the Corporal, the last man of Marion ducks to the side as a VOLLEY OF REDCOAT MUSKET FIRE tears into the spot marked by Marion's rifle smoke. FROM THIS MOMENT ON, MARION NEVER STOPS MOVING. He strides rather than runs, staying just inside the brush, offering only glimpses of himself. He changes his pace and direction repeatedly, ducking and weaving, firing and loading while moving. He never gives the Redcoats a stationary target, especially one marked by billowing smoke from his flintlock. It's an Indian tactic and it The Redcoats TRACK HIM WITH THEIR BARRELS, about to fire. Marion suddenly STOPS DEAD, REVERSES DIRECTION, several REDCOATS FIRE AND MISS. Six Redcoats left. Some primed, some reloading. A REDCOAT draws a bead on Marion who drops to the ground and FIRES, killing him. Samuel, WEEPING as he loads, hands a primed musket to Nathan who FIRES. The Redcoats turn their attention to THE SPOT MARKED BY
MARION: Samuel, reload. Nathan, untie They quickly do so as Marion picks up a loaded musket and scans the road and the underbrush. In a moment they're ready. Marion finds his own Pennsylvania rifle, then he and his sons disappear into the underbrush.
MARION: There, there. he's alright. he's with your mother now. He stiffens, speaking formally:
MARION: Lord, we pray that You accept this child, Thomas Marion and give him a place at Your side with his mother. We ask that You embrace him and help us to understand the manner in which Your mercy works. This we ask, in Your name. Amen.
MARION'S CHILDREN: Marion looks at Elizabeth's grave, then he gently eases his children away.
GABRIEL: The Morgans, the Halseys, Williams, The smoke from the separate fires joins together high in the sky, forming what looks like stormclouds. They walk EXT. CHARLOTTE'S FARM - NIGHT Marion and his children wait in the cover of the woods. They see a pair of shadowed figures coming toward them from the house, Gabriel and Charlotte.
GABRIEL: Father, it's safe. Marion hustles the children out of the woods.
MARION: Sleep, now. Marion moves on to Nathan.
NATHAN: Father. I killed those men.
MARION: Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.
NATHAN: I'm glad I killed them. I'm Marion isn't. He turns to Samuel who's cried-out. Marion reaches out to touch him but Samuel recoils from Marion's blood-streaked hand. Marion sighs and tucks him in.
MARION: Try to get some sleep. Marion moves to take Susan from Charlotte who shakes her I'll stay with them. Marion nods and leaves Charlotte with the children.
CHARLOTTE: I'll stay with them. Marion nods and leaves Charlotte with the children.
GABRIEL: How are they? Marion just shakes his head.
GABRIEL: Gates is at Hillsboro with the Continental Army. I'll leave in the morning to join him. Marion nods. Marion and Gabriel stand in silence for a long moment, neither one finding words. Then Gabriel speaks softly.
GABRIEL: I'll tend my horse. He leaves Marion alone.
CHARLOTTE: They're asleep. Marion is silent. Charlotte pours water into a washbowl and motions to Marion. He takes off his shirt. She begins cleaning away the blood and tending the wound on his neck.
MARION: How did this. how did I let this You couldn't have known.
CHARLOTTE: You couldn't have known.
MARION: I should have known. once I would have. I used to be wary. and today I watched my son killed before my eyes. your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be I've done nothing and for that I am She looks at him closely.
CHARLOTTE: Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be I've done nothing and for that I am She looks at him closely.
MARION: I've done nothing and for that I am She looks at him closely.
CHARLOTTE: If you go, I'll care for them as if they were my own.
MARION: I'll leave in the morning with He stares past her, looking at the flames in the fireplace. She tends his wounds.
WILLIAM: When will you be back?
MARION: I don't know, William.
WILLIAM: Marion winces. Margaret puts her arm around William.
MARGARET: No, not tomorrow. Marion kisses them both, then moves on to Susan, trying to coax a word out of the silent four-year-old:
MARION: She just looks at him.
MARION: Just one word? Goodbye? That's all I want. Susan shakes her head. He sighs, rises and turns to Charlotte. They hesitate, then embrace, hugging deeply but a bit awkwardly, holding each other just a moment longer than one would expect. She looks up at him. he kisses her on the cheek. Marion mounts up. And he and Gabriel head off, Susan, unnoticed and unheard, whispers:
SUSAN: Marion and Gabriel ride away.
MARION: No, it's too late. Gabriel stops. Marion points out brightly colored clusters of men behind each army.
MARION: Command posts. Patriot. The distant slash of red stops. Marion and Gabriel hear only a GENTLE WIND and some nearby SONGBIRDS. Then, from a black mass of the side of the red slash, a sudden, silent eruption of white smoke. An instant later, the blue slash quivers. A moment later the SOUND OF THE CANNONS, RUMBLES UP THE HILL and rolls over Marion and Gabriel. The RED SLASH STOPS moving. It darkens as thousands of Redcoats raise their muskets and the front ranks kneel into firing position. Marion's eyes dart. He knows what's coming.
MARION: Break for the trees. break for the A MASSIVE ERUPTION OF WHITE SMOKE billows from the red slash. An instant later, the blue line starts to break up as hundreds of distant Patriots fall. The SOUND OF THE BRITISH MUSKETS reaches Marion and Gabriel like the pattering of rain. Then the SMOKE OF INEFFECTIVE, SCATTERED VOLLEYS erupts from the Patriot lines. The red line holds firm.
MARION: Send them to cover! Goddamn you! But the blue line of the Patriots stays in the open field. From behind the Redcoats, FAST-MOVING GREEN AND RED MASSES move quickly onto the battlefield. CAVALRY.
GABRIEL: Father, we have to do something. The British cavalry slams into the blue line, shattering it. Tiny bits of blue move in every direction.
GABRIEL: It's already over. Marion watches, appalled. At this distance the moving slashes of color and billowing smoke are strangely beautiful. Marion turns his horse and heads down the hill, toward the rear of the Patriot lines.
MARION: It's already over. Marion watches, appalled. At this distance the moving slashes of color and billowing smoke are strangely beautiful. Marion turns his horse and heads down the hill, toward the rear of the Patriot lines.
LEE: Damn you, Sergeant, don't move the wounded twice, put them straight on the wagons from the surgeons.
PATRIOT SERGEANT: Yes, sir.
LEE: Lieutenant, detail men for outriders. We move out as soon as the wounded are ready.
LIEUTENANT: Yes, sir. The Lieutenant rushes off. Lee notices Marion and Gabriel, surprised to see them. He jerks his head for them to follow him into:
MARION: Green Dragoons came to my home, killed my son, Thomas. It was Tarleton himself.
LEE: I'm sorry.
MARION: I'm sorry I wasn't here for this.
LEE: There's nothing you could have done, Gates is a damned fool.
MARION: We saw.
LEE: I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle. He spent too many years in the British army.
MARION: Where is he now?
LEE: Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up.
MARION: Who's in command?
LEE: I am, I think.
MARION: What are my orders? Lee gives Marion a tired smile.
LEE: If you want orders, I've got some for you. Lee ROLLS OUT A MAP for Marion and Gabriel.
LEE: We're a breath away from losing this war. In the North, Washington is reeling from Valley Forge, running and hiding from Clinton and twelve thousand Redcoats. Here in the South, Cornwallis has broken our back. He captured over five thousand of our troops when he took Charleston and today he destroyed the only army that stood between him and New York.
MARION: So now Cornwallis will head north, link up with Clinton and finish off And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield. Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive. A treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga. The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops.
LEE: And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield. Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive. A treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga. The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops.
MARION: Fall, six months at the earliest.
LEE: Fall, six months at the earliest.
MARION: Long time.
LEE: The bigger problem is where, not when. The French fleet won't sail north of the Chesapeake for fear of early storms.
MARION: So you're going to try to keep Cornwallis in the South until then.
LEE: Not me, you. I'm going north with every Continental regular I can find to reinforce Washington or he won't last six weeks.
MARION: You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?
LEE: Not held, just slowed down.
MARION: They're nothing but farmers and you're asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard. They'd be better off letting it move on.
LEE: They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't be.
MARION: How many men does Cornwallis have under his command?
LEE: Four thousand infantry and around six hundred cavalry. . including the Green Dragoons under Tarleton. At the mention of Tarleton, Marion nods.
MARION: I'll do what I can. Lee quickly writes something.
LEE: I'm giving you a field commission as a colonel. He hands it to Marion. Gabriel steps forward.
GABRIEL: Colonel Lee, I request a transfer to Colonel Marion's command.
LEE: Lee scribbles another order and hands it to Gabriel. Then he turns to Marion.
LEE: Good luck. Marion nods. They duck out of the tent.
GABRIEL: What now, sir?
MARION: We put out the word. We'll start along the south side of the We'd cover more ground if we split It's safer if we stay together. Gabriel steps in front of Marion.
GABRIEL: We'd cover more ground if we split It's safer if we stay together. Gabriel steps in front of Marion.
MARION: It's safer if we stay together. Gabriel steps in front of Marion.
GABRIEL: Colonel, I didn't request this transfer because you're my father. I requested it because I believe in this cause and this is where I can do the most good.
MARION: I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
GABRIEL: I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
MARION: Is that so?
GABRIEL: Yes, sir. My father taught me. Marion looks at Gabriel closely.
MARION: Did your father teach you humility?
GABRIEL: He tried. It didn't take. Marion looks Gabriel up and down.
MARION: Alright, Corporal, you take Bennington, Harrisville, Acworth and the farms along Black Swamp. I'll take the north side of the river. We'll meet at Snow's Island.
GABRIEL: Yes, sir. They mount up.
MARION: And, Corporal. . be careful.
GABRIEL: ( beat ) . father. They ride off in different directions.
MARION: I'm looking for John Billings.
BARTENDER: He's dead. Marion looks closely at the grim, suspicious men.
MARION: If he comes back from the dead, tell him Francis Marion is looking for I'll be sure to do that. As Marion turns to leave he notices an open bottle of Madeira on one of the tables. He stops.
BARTENDER: I'll be sure to do that. As Marion turns to leave he notices an open bottle of Madeira on one of the tables. He stops.
MARION: I'll wait. Miracles happen. A stand-off. Then, a hulking FIGURE appears in the shadows at the back doorway. He's JOHN BILLINGS, big, coarse, about Marion's age. Billings jerks his head for Marion to join him in the back room.
BILLINGS: You expect to hold Cornwallis with I expect to try.
MARION: I expect to try.
BILLINGS: Trust you and Harry Lee. Remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit Fort Louis?
MARION: It worked. How many men can you Not many. Dalton, Scott, they've got their reasons; Rev. Oliver, he believes in the cause; some of the young bucks; a few like me with nothing to lose. What about you? You've got a lot to Marion drains his glass and stands up.
BILLINGS: Not many. Dalton, Scott, they've got their reasons; Rev. Oliver, he believes in the cause; some of the young bucks; a few like me with nothing to lose. What about you? You've got a lot to Marion drains his glass and stands up.
MARION: You coming, or not? Billings drains his glass. They walk out together.
GABRIEL: Father, this war is about more than Marion doesn't look up.
MARION: Is it?
GABRIEL: If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself.
MARION: How old are you?
GABRIEL: You know how old I am.
MARION: God help us all when you're forty. Marion puts some more lead soldiers into the pan. Gabriel shakes his head, turns away and goes to tend his horse.
MARION: REV. OLIVER I heard about your son. I'm sorry. Marion accepts his condolences. He notes GEORGE DALTON, a tough-looking, rustic man with an ice-cold, distant stare.
REV. OLIVER: I heard about your son. I'm sorry. Marion accepts his condolences. He notes GEORGE DALTON, a tough-looking, rustic man with an ice-cold, distant stare.
MARION: Dalton doesn't respond. Marion recognizes another face, ABNER BROWN, African-American, around thirty, rugged. Marion addresses the men who do not gather around so much as just give him their attention.
MARION: You all have your own reasons for being here. I lost a son and I intend to kill the man who killed Marion pauses and looks over at Gabriel.
MARION: . But I don't consider that man's life adequate payment for the life of my son, and killing him won't keep the sons of other men from Gabriel nods, approvingly.
MARION: Cornwallis has to move north. We have to keep him right here. If he's south of the Chesapeake when the French arrive, if the French arrive, we have a chance of winning this war. Marion looks from face to face.
MARION: Eat, get some rest, we move out in two hours. Marion heads back to his campsite, passing Gabriel without looking at him, but very aware of his son's eyes on him.
CORNWALLIS: The officers gather around the map.
CORNWALLIS: Major, this is not an adequate map.
MAJOR HUNTINGTON: We have better coming on the trailing supply convoy from A useful place for our maps.
CORNWALLIS: A useful place for our maps.
MAJOR HUNTINGTON: I'm sorry, sir, it won't happen Tarleton enters, followed by Wilkins.
CORNWALLIS: My harrier. Join us, Colonel.
TARLETON: Tarleton and Wilkins join them around the map.
CORNWALLIS: Gentlemen, celebration is premature. We have a difficult campaign ahead of us. We are in predominately hostile country and we cannot rely on forage. As we move north, the bulk of our supplies will reach us by sea, through Charleston, which will give us a long and vulnerable supply line, one that can only be secured if the locals are loyal to the crown.
CORNWALLIS' OFFICERS: ( multiple ) Yes, sir. Cornwallis turns to his field officers, paying particular attention to Tarleton.
CORNWALLIS: Nonetheless, we must remember that this is a civil war. Tarleton proudly holds Cornwallis' look.
CORNWALLIS: These colonials are our brethren and when this conflict is over, we will be reestablishing commerce with them. Surrendering troops will be given quarter and unwarranted assaults on civilians will cease. Wilkins shifts uneasily. Tarleton isn't cowed.
CORNWALLIS: I expect this war to be fought in a vigorous but civilized manner. Cornwallis looks at his other officers.
CORNWALLIS: Have I made myself clear, gentlemen?
OFFICERS: ( multiple ) Yes, sir. Cornwallis shifts his eyes back to Tarleton who was not among those who spoke. Tarleton pointedly pauses a moment, then says:
TARLETON: Yes, sir. Cornwallis turns his attention back to the map. His men gather around.
WILKINS: I believe he was speaking to us, Did you know that Lord Cornwallis' father was a tenant on the estate of my grandfather? Tarleton jerks his reins and rides off. Wilkins laughs and follows.
TARLETON: Did you know that Lord Cornwallis' father was a tenant on the estate of my grandfather? Tarleton jerks his reins and rides off. Wilkins laughs and follows.
GABRIEL: Less than a mile. Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear.
MARION: Flanking riders?
GABRIEL: I didn't see any. Marion nods and motions to his men who check their weapons and pass the word. Gabriel ties up his horse and takes a position near his father.
REDCOAT LIEUTENANT: Across the river! Covering fire! Double rank! Marion calls to his men.
MARION: Epaulets first. Kill the officers. Marion and his men FIRE A WITHERING VOLLEY, KILLING ALL REDCOATS OF RANK two lieutenants, a sergeant and several corporals. The LEADERLESS REDCOAT PRIVATES take cover as Marion's men OPEN UP on the Redcoats on their side of the river.
MARION: THE WAGONS! With half of his men FIRING COVER, Marion and the other half run to the wagons, passing Redcoat dead and DALTON, notices a WOUNDED REDCOAT and pauses. The Redcoat looks up imploringly at Dalton who finishes reloading, then coldly FIRES, KILLING THE helpless Marion, Gabriel and Rev. Oliver see Dalton kill the wounded Redcoat as they race toward the wagons, British musketballs SPLINTERING TREES all around them. The horses nearest the burning bridge are terrified, BUCKING AND REARING, STRUGGLING in their traces. MARION LEAPS INTO THE SEAT of one wagon. Gabriel and Billings grab the reins of two more wagons. The Redcoats keep up a STEADY FIRE. TWO OF MARION'S MEN FALL, one dead another wounded. Marion, Gabriel and Billings STRUGGLE TO CONTROL THE FRIGHTENED HORSES, backing them up around the curve to the cover of the woods.

REV. OLIVER: . two-hundred-sixty-six Brown Bess muskets, forty-one casks of powder, balls, tamping.
BILLINGS: We have enough arms for an army. Now all we need is an army. Marion checks out a wagon full of tools with DAN SCOTT and ROB FIELDING, a couple of sharp-eyed craftsmen. They overlap dialogue, rapidly speaking the private language of colonial artisans.
SCOTT: Reamer, boring tool.
MARION: Swage, broach, etching tool.
FIELDING: A rolling gunsmith's shop.
SCOTT: We can rifle those musket barrels.
FIELDING: Get another hundred yards out of We'll need a forge.
MARION: We'll need a forge.
SCOTT: Easy enough.
MARION: We've got clay to make a chamber.
FIELDING: Oak to make charcoal.
SCOTT: Oil cloth and barrel staves to make a bellows.
MARION: And we can yank a wagon wheel, weight it, rig a piston and drive shaft and we'll have a flywheel to power the bellows. Scott and Fielding exchange an impressed look.
SCOTT: ( to Fielding ) That's why he's a colonel. Scott and Fielding roll up their sleeves and get to work. Marion hears a COMMOTION OF BARKING DOGS AND YELLING MEN and strides over to find Billings cowering before TWO HUGE GREAT DANES who stand guard at one of the wagons.
BILLINGS: Shoot them! Shoot the damn things! Dalton prepares to do so.
MARION: Put that pistol down!
SCOTT: They followed us from the bridge. They won't let anyone near the Marion steps forward, speaking softly but firmly to the Stay. stay. stay. The dogs waver between obeying Marion and ripping out his Don't you growl at me! The dogs decide to obey. Marion lets them sniff his hand, then firmly pats them.
MARION: Stay. stay. stay. The dogs waver between obeying Marion and ripping out his Don't you growl at me! The dogs decide to obey. Marion lets them sniff his hand, then firmly pats them.
MARION: Don't you growl at me! The dogs decide to obey. Marion lets them sniff his hand, then firmly pats them.
MARION: Now let's see what's in this wagon. Rev. Oliver and Abner join him. Billings eases past the dogs. Abner opens a large case and finds it filled with Rum, French Champagne, Madeira, No wonder they were guarding it. Gabriel opens a trunk and finds it filled with powdered wigs, all perfectly coifed and stored on head-shaped wig- stands. Rev. Oliver opens one of several identical cases and finds it filled with papers.
ABNER: Rum, French Champagne, Madeira, No wonder they were guarding it. Gabriel opens a trunk and finds it filled with powdered wigs, all perfectly coifed and stored on head-shaped wig- stands. Rev. Oliver opens one of several identical cases and finds it filled with papers.
BILLINGS: No wonder they were guarding it. Gabriel opens a trunk and finds it filled with powdered wigs, all perfectly coifed and stored on head-shaped wig- stands. Rev. Oliver opens one of several identical cases and finds it filled with papers.
REV. OLIVER: My heavens, personal correspondence of. Lord Cornwallis. Marion grabs some papers, scans them, then finds matching cases on nearby wagons.
MARION: These four wagons must be his.
GABRIEL: And the dogs, too, I'll wager.
BILLINGS: I say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs, and use the papers for musket His journals, letters, maps, Abner calls from another wagon.
MARION: His journals, letters, maps, Abner calls from another wagon.
ABNER: Colonel, we got a wagon full of officer's uniforms and more powder and muskets here. Ignoring Abner, Marion, sits down on a stump with a pile of Cornwallis' papers and starts to read.
MARION: Today was hard earned but a good Marion looks at Dalton, then turns to the other men as In the future wounded British soldiers will be given quarters.
MARION: In the future wounded British soldiers will be given quarters.
DALTON: Like they gave quarter to my family? My wife and three children were hiding in our root cellar when they came. The Redcoats locked the door and torched the house.
MARION: You have my sympathy. but the order stands.
DALTON: And who are you to give an order like that? We all know what you did after Fort Wilderness. That hits home but Marion remains calm.
MARION: I'm your commanding officer. This is militia, not regular army. I can't hold you here, but as long as you stay, you'll follow my orders. Marion looks from face to face. Most begrudgingly nod. That's enough for Marion. As he heads back to his own campfire he's intercepted by Rev. Oliver who speaks to him out of earshot of the other men, except for Gabriel and Billings who overhear.
REV. OLIVER: Thank you.
MARION: For what?
REV. OLIVER: For trying to impose some decency on that sort.
MARION: Don't depend on my decency. I'm one of that sort. Marion walks on. Rev. Oliver exchanges a look with Gabriel, then heads off. As Marion joins Gabriel and Billings at his campfire, Billings grips his bottle.
BILLINGS: Am I one of that sort?
MARION: You're the worst of that sort. You're the sort that gives that sort a bad name. Billings considers that, then shrugs and takes a long drink. He hands the bottle to Marion who takes an equally long drink. Marion picks up his Pennsylvania rifle.
MARION: I'm going to check the watch. He disappears into the darkness leaving Gabriel and Billings at the campfire.
GABRIEL: He shouldn't make light. That Redcoat should not have been killed.
BILLINGS: He's not making light. Gabriel shoots Billings a dubious look.
BILLINGS: You don't know him very well, do He's my father. Billings looks closely at Gabriel.
GABRIEL: He's my father. Billings looks closely at Gabriel.
GABRIEL: I know him well enough?
BILLINGS: Don't fault him for having grown up on the frontier. It was a harder time and a harder place than you Gabriel looks at Billings, then turns back to the fire.
BILLINGS: I've just been inside the mind of a genius. Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen Cheerful news to greet the morn.
MARION: I've just been inside the mind of a genius. Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen Cheerful news to greet the morn.
BILLINGS: Cheerful news to greet the morn.
MARION: His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically. But he has a weakness. They all turn to Marion.
MARION: Lord Cornwallis is brilliant. His weakness is that he knows it.
GABRIEL: Pride is his weakness. The men consider that.
MARION: Pride is his weakness. The men consider that.
BILLINGS: Personally, I'd prefer stupidity.
MARION: Pride will do. BEGIN MONTAGE: Series of shots as follows: A VOLLEY OF MUSKET FIRE erupts from some thick Marion rides with about fifty men. A British supply convoy makes its way through the Marion rides with about seventy-five men. Cornwallis finishes reading a dispatch and furiously Marion rides with about one hundred men. Snow's Island. Marion and his men do an inventory of a Marion rides with about one-hundred-fifty men. Marion, Gabriel, and some of the other men watch as the A seething Cornwallis stands at the same spot, looking Snow's Island. Marion sits with his muddy feet on
CORNWALLIS: Why am I here, Colonel Halbert?
MAJOR HALBERT: For the ball, sir? Cornwallis holds his temper.
CORNWALLIS: Why, after six weeks, are we still here to attend a ball. By now, we should be attending balls in North Carolina, not South Carolina.
MAJOR HALBERT: Our supply line, sir?
CORNWALLIS: Excellent guess, Major. The valet puts a dress coat on Cornwallis who looks at the garment with deepest disdain.
CORNWALLIS: And what, praytell, is this?
VALET: Uh. I borrowed it from Colonel North. I took it in at the back, added wider epaulets, a court sash and looped gold braiding on the It's a horse blanket. First my personal baggage, then half the bridges and ferries between here and Charleston burned, a dozen convoys attacked. Colonel, if you can't secure our supply line against militia, how do you expect to do so against Colonial regulars or the French when they come?
CORNWALLIS: It's a horse blanket. First my personal baggage, then half the bridges and ferries between here and Charleston burned, a dozen convoys attacked. Colonel, if you can't secure our supply line against militia, how do you expect to do so against Colonial regulars or the French when they come?
COLONEL HALBERT: Sir, they're not like regulars, we can't find them and we don't know when or where they're going to How impolite. And who leads these clever, secretive fellows?
CORNWALLIS: How impolite. And who leads these clever, secretive fellows?
COLONEL HALBERT: We don't know, sir. He's called, the Commander by some, the Swamp Fox by others.
CORNWALLIS: Colonel, I'm a civilized man but I'm finding to difficult to remain civil. Secure my supply line.
COLONEL HALBERT: Yes, sir. Cornwallis looks at his reflection with dismay, sighs and strides out. Tarleton, amused, follows.
REDCOAT GUARD: Hey, what you got there? The drunken Redcoats look up, bringing their faces into the light THE DRUNKEN REDCOATS ARE BILLINGS AND DALTON.
BILLINGS: We got our own little party.
DALTON: To hell with the officers and their fancy dress ball.
GUARD: Give us a nip, here. Billings and Dalton walk over to the Redcoats guards. As the guards reach for the bottles, Billings SLAMS one of the guards back against the building. Dalton DRAWS A KNIFE and PLUNGES IT into the second guard's belly and HACKS HIM OPEN. Dalton shoves Billings out of the way, SLITS THE OTHER GUARD'S THROAT. Billings is taken aback by the speed and ferocity of Dalton's attack. Marion and Scott duck into the shadows of the doorway, pull out hammer-less carving chisels and quickly and silently start gouging out the wood around the hinges of the heavy door. Billings and Dalton take the posts of the guards while the other men drag the bodies of the real guards out of sight. Everything appears as it should.
MRS. TALBOT: No! The beasts took your dogs, as Fine animals, a gift from His Majesty. Dead now, for all I know.
CORNWALLIS: Fine animals, a gift from His Majesty. Dead now, for all I know.
MRS. TALBOT: Is there no decency?
MR. TALBOT: Among the rebels? We know the answer to that.
CORNWALLIS: Yes, we have learned.
MRS. TALBOT: You seem far away.
CORNWALLIS: It's the weight of command and the lot of a widower memories, . and long gazes at the moon. Mrs. Talbot sympathetically sighs and touches her fingertips to her heart which is conveniently located inches above her stunning cleavage.
MRS. TALBOT: Oh, you poor man. A MASSIVE EXPLOSION LIGHTS UP THE NIGHT as a FIREBALL erupts from the armory. British officers, including Major Halbert and Tarleton, RUSH OUT along with Mr. Talbot and other Loyalist civilians.
MAJOR HALBERT: Good God! Mr. Talbot tears his eyes from the flames and looks at his wife, clinging to Cornwallis' arm.
MR. TALBOT: These rebels seem to lack fear as well as decency, eh, General? Cornwallis registers the insult, glances at the hapless Major Halbert, then turns to Tarleton.
CORNWALLIS: Colonel Tarleton, you deal with these damned rebels.
TARLETON: Yes, sir. Tarleton smiles grimly and strides off the balcony.
GREEN: . four baskets of apples, salt pork, sweet potatoes, jerky, hard tack, salt and powder. It's not much, but I'll get you more.
MARION: We can't pay for this.
GREEN: I'll give you what I can, when I can. You pay me what you can. Green's daughter, ANNE, very attractive, around sixteen, joins them. Gabriel sees her and sidles over.
GREEN: Francis, you remember my daughter, Nice to see you again, Anne. Gabriel clears his throat. Anne looks at him coolly.
MARION: Nice to see you again, Anne. Gabriel clears his throat. Anne looks at him coolly.
ANNE: I know who you are, Gabriel Marion. The last time I saw you, I was nine and you put ink in my tea.
GABRIEL: I. uh. that wasn't me, it was Samuel. I mean Nathan.
ANNE: It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
GABRIEL: Uh. uh. I.
GREEN: He's sorry. Come. Green heads across the square where some townspeople are giving Marion's men provisions. Anne and Gabriel follow. Marion turns to some waiting men, new recruits. Billings, nearby, reads A POSTED BROADSHEET that announces: "Reward Offered: For the capture or death of the rebel known as 'The Swamp Fox'". He tears it down and walks over to Marion.
MARION: . and your terms of enlistment will be month-to-month. Every thirty days you can re-enlist or return to your families. REED, the sturdiest of the lot offers his hand to Marion.
REED: I'm in. The others nod in agreement.
MARION: Talk to Abner and Scott about provisions, powder and mounts. The recruits head off. Billings hands Marion the wanted poster which Marion glances at and crumbles up.
BILLINGS: Twenty men here, seventeen in New Brighton, a dozen along the Black River. We'll pass three hundred by week's end if this keeps up.
GABRIEL: If I'd known you were going to look like this, I never would have put ink in your tea.
ANNE: You call that a compliment?
GABRIEL: It's a start. She gives him a bit of a smile. He checks out her teeth.
GABRIEL: They look nice. As white as can be. She tries to glare but she can't help but laugh. MARION AND BILLINGS watch as Anne gives Gabriel some apples which he tosses into the air, one-by-one, catching them behind his back, a cocky move, executed with a disarming smile that makes Anne laugh again. Marion smiles at his son's flirtation. Billings smiles as well.
BILLINGS: He reminds me of you before you got old and ugly.
MARION: ( softly ) No, he takes after his mother. Billings is taken aback by the gentleness of Marion's . the younger ones barely remember her but Gabriel spent more time with Elizabeth. she taught him well, guided him, she was his North Star and mine. her father was a minister, in Boston, did you know Billings nods.
MARION: . the younger ones barely remember her but Gabriel spent more time with Elizabeth. she taught him well, guided him, she was his North Star and mine. her father was a minister, in Boston, did you know Billings nods.
MARION: . Gabriel's already a better man than I could ever hope to be. Marion hears himself and pulls his eyes from Gabriel, adopting a coarse, joking tone.
MARION: What do you mean, old and ugly?
BILLINGS: You got me beat on both accounts.
MARION: The hell I do. They mount up, grateful to leave the sincerity behind. Gabriel sees Marion and his men starting to ride off. He says goodbye to Anne, then RUNS TO HIS HORSE, MOUNTING WITH A DRAMATIC LEAP. He GALLOPS up, taking his place at his father's side. Marion doesn't turn to look at him, but he knows he's there.
MARION: Gabriel? Are you asleep?
GABRIEL: We're low on salt. I should go to Pembroke and get some.
BILLINGS: You got salt last week.
GABRIEL: Oh, right. Baking powder, we need baking We've got plenty of baking powder. You went to Pembroke and got five pounds two weeks ago. Gabriel sighs. They hear a SOUND APPROACHING, then see two British wagons round a curve with a guard of only SIX REDCOATS, commanded by a REDCOAT SERGEANT. The Redcoat Sergeant signals stop.
BILLINGS: We've got plenty of baking powder. You went to Pembroke and got five pounds two weeks ago. Gabriel sighs. They hear a SOUND APPROACHING, then see two British wagons round a curve with a guard of only SIX REDCOATS, commanded by a REDCOAT SERGEANT. The Redcoat Sergeant signals stop.
REDCOAT SERGEANT: Halt. Look alive, boys. The young Redcoat privates nervously UNSHOULDER THEIR
MARION: Sergeant, this road is closed. Those wagons now belong to the Continental Army.
REDCOAT SERGEANT: Ready arms! By twos! Marion's surprised by the Sergeant's order.
MARION: Sergeant, there's no reason for you and your men to die. Just leave the wagons and go.
REDCOAT SERGEANT: Steady, boys. Marion sighs and lets loose with a PIERCING WHISTLE. The underbrush parts and more of Marion's men show themselves, MUSKETS LEVELED at the outnumbered Redcoats.
REDCOAT SERGEANT: This is the King's highway and I advise you and your men to make way. Prepare to fire. Marion exchanges a look with Rev. Oliver who, like Marion, doesn't want to kill these men. Seeing no other option, Marion turns to give the order, then stops, hearing a
MARION: It's a trap. The canvas sides of the British wagons are THROWN UP and DOZENS OF REDCOATS, armed with muskets, spill out. Marion's unmounted men run to their horses, LEAPING into their saddles. Then GREEN DRAGOONS appear, galloping down the wooded slopes on both flanks, astonishing horsemen, weaving through the trees without slacking their pace, SWORDS
REDCOAT SERGEANT: A THUNDEROUS VOLLEY ERUPTS from the Redcoat infantry, KILLING several of Marion's men. Marion's men FIRE BACK from their BUCKING MOUNTS, most of their shots going awry. Behind the British wagons, a huge detachment of GREEN DRAGOONS appears, TARLETON among them.
FIRE!: A THUNDEROUS VOLLEY ERUPTS from the Redcoat infantry, KILLING several of Marion's men. Marion's men FIRE BACK from their BUCKING MOUNTS, most of their shots going awry. Behind the British wagons, a huge detachment of GREEN DRAGOONS appears, TARLETON among them.
MARION: Marion's men ride off, leaving him ALONE. a Dragoon is almost on him, SWORD RAISED. Marion, his weapon spent, sees a thick branch on the ground, two feet long. grabs The sword flashes and SINKS DEEPLY INTO THE WOOD. Marion YANKS, brings the rider off his horse, grabs the reins and SWINGS HIMSELF UP INTO THE EMPTY SADDLE. Marion rides down the embankment. The Dragoons rein back, slowed by the dead horses and men. They spur their reluctant mounts over the bodies and follow Marion and his men into the swamp.

TARLETON: Which way?
GASKINS: This way. no this. I think. Tarleton makes his own choice. rides off. the Green Dragoons follow, the Loyalists bring up the rear.
TARLETON: Tarleton glares into the impenetrable darkness of plant- choked water and swamp.
HALT!: Tarleton glares into the impenetrable darkness of plant- choked water and swamp.
TARLETON: Enough of this. There are other ways to run down a fox. Tarleton yanks on his reins, turns his horse and starts back the way they came. His grateful men turn their horses and follow. IN THE UNDERGROWTH, Marion, Gabriel, Billings and three badly wounded men, with only four horses between them, calm their mounts. They can hear, but not see the Dragoons. Then, through the thick undergrowth, MARION CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF
GABRIEL: Father, no. As Marion spurs his horse to ride after Tarleton, Gabriel grabs the bridle. He YANKS HARD, stopping Marion's horse dead. THE HORSE BUCKS, nearly throwing Marion.
MARION: That's him. Tarleton. MARION SPURS THE HORSE which tries to respond but is JERKED BACK AGAIN by Gabriel. Marion angrily turns on his Damn you! Let go! Gabriel looks up at his father, never loosening his iron grip on the bridles but speaking softly, almost Father, please. Marion looks down at Gabriel. Then Marion looks over at Billings and the three wounded men. One bleeds from an ugly neck wound. their shared mounts are nearly spent. Marion takes a last look in the direction of the departing Tarleton. Then he dismounts and hurries over to help the wounded. Gabriel watches his father for a moment, then joins him with the wounded.

GABRIEL: Fourteen dead, eleven wounded, eighteen captured.
MARION: I should have killed him when I had the chance?
GABRIEL: When was that? In the swamp at the expense of your men? Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your Or perhaps tomorrow at the expense of our cause. Marion is silent.
MARION: Or perhaps tomorrow at the expense of our cause. Marion is silent.
GABRIEL: Or perhaps tomorrow at the expense of our cause. Marion is silent.
GABRIEL: There will be a time and a place for revenge but killing Tarleton at the expense of your duty serves no one but yourself. Stay the course. The parental-sounding formality of Gabriel's words brings a thin smile to Marion's face.
MARION: Stay the course. your mother used to say that to me when I'd get drunk or lose my temper.
GABRIEL: She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas or Nathan.
MARION: You learned her lessons better than
GABRIEL: She got me at a more impressionable Marion smiles, nods a silent thanks to his son and heads over to help with the wounded.
ANNE: Next time we'll bring more blankets.
GABRIEL: That would be nice.
ANNE: Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.
GABRIEL: That would be nice, too. She takes a pot off the campfire and pours him a cup of Just because the French didn't come this fall, doesn't mean they're never going to come. He nods and takes a drink of the tea. She smiles. Gabriel smiles back to her, revealing a mouthful of ink- stained, black teeth. Before she has time to laugh. ROLLINS RIDES HARD INTO CAMP. Marion hurries over, accompanied by the Great Danes. The other men gather They're to be hung!

ROLLINS: They're to be hung!
GABRIEL: But they're prisoners-of-war! Marion isn't as surprised as Gabriel. He is, however, taken aback by Gabriel's black teeth. Gabriel notices everyone looking at his mouth. Anne is embarrassed and regretful, seeing her joke fly in the face of the troubling news.
REDCOAT SENTRY: INT. CORNWALLIS' HEADQUARTERS - FORT CAROLINA - DAY A temporary HQ has been set up in a commandeered farmhouse. Cornwallis stands uncomfortably while a tailor measures him and marks alterations on a partially completed uniform. Tarleton enters.
TARLETON: General, a message from the commander of the rebel militia. Cornwallis reads the message.
CORNWALLIS: It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley.
TARLETON: Are you going to meet with him?
CORNWALLIS: Most certainly. Arrange it.
MAJOR HALBERT: Lord Cornwallis will be with you Thank you.
MARION: Thank you.
MAJOR HALBERT: You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that.
MARION: ( interrupting ) I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.
MAJOR HALBERT: Yes, quite, but you should know That will be all, Major. I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
MARION: That will be all, Major. I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
MAJOR HALBERT: ( coldly ) Yes. you will wait. Major Halbert turns and starts to stride out.
MARION: One other thing. Major Halbert stops.
MARION: The proper form of address to a superior officer, even one of an opposing army, is "Yes, sir." Major Halbert sneers and strides from the room. MARION ALONE, EXCEPT FOR THE DOGS, allows himself a fleeting smile. Then he looks around the room. He notes a rocking chair. Curious, he hefts it. Too heavy. He puts it down, sits and rocks. The dogs walk over and lay at his INT. CORNWALLIS' HEADQUARTERS - DAY ( LATER ) Marion patiently sits rocking. One of the dogs has its head in his lap and Marion scratches it behind the ears.
CORNWALLIS: Jupiter! Mars! The dogs just look at Cornwallis. He holds out his arms, waiting for them to rush to him. They look up at Marion who nods to them.
MARION: The dogs run to Cornwallis and nuzzle him in a friendly but not enthusiastic manner. Cornwallis pats them vigorously, too vigorously for the moderate level of joy the dogs are showing at their reunion.
CORNWALLIS: My boys. my boys. you seem to have been well fed. Thank you for that, Colonel.
MARION: My pleasure, sir.
CORNWALLIS: Please forgive me for keeping you Apology accepted.
MARION: Apology accepted.
CORNWALLIS: Thank you, Colonel. I'm afraid I don't know your name.
MARION: Colonel will do.
CORNWALLIS: As you wish. TARLETON ENTERS with four Dragoons, all armed. Marion freezes. Marion and Tarleton lock eyes. Marion searches for some sign that Tarleton recognizes him. There's none.
CORNWALLIS: Colonel. Colonel Banastre Tarleton nods.
TARLETON: Marion, like ice, looks Tarleton up and down. Then he slowly turns and looks at the four Dragoons, two on either side of Tarleton. Marion measures the odds and finds them With a supreme effort of will, Marion forces himself to turn from Tarleton to Cornwallis and the matter at hand.
MARION: Shall we proceed?
CORNWALLIS: Let us. Unless you object, I would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and, as such, there are certain customary practices. Perhaps I could explain them to I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
MARION: I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
CORNWALLIS: I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War.
MARION: I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War.
CORNWALLIS: Oh. Very well, then. Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
MARION: Unless you would like to claim aggrieved status. Cornwallis is surprised. He exchanges a look with You are familiar with how these things are done. In fact, I would like to claim aggrieved status.
CORNWALLIS: You are familiar with how these things are done. In fact, I would like to claim aggrieved status.
MARION: Very well, proceed, sir.
CORNWALLIS: First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me.
MARION: I will do so as soon as possible. Cornwallis is surprised.
CORNWALLIS: Thank you.
MARION: Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
CORNWALLIS: Apology accepted. Now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable.
MARION: That one is a bit more difficult.
CORNWALLIS: Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile And what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention?
MARION: And what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention?
CORNWALLIS: Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other. There must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and That is a separate issue.
MARION: Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and That is a separate issue.
CORNWALLIS: That is a separate issue.
MARION: I consider them linked.
CORNWALLIS: I beg to differ. One is a command decision on your part. The other represents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult As long as your soldiers attack civilians, I will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement. And my men are excellent marksmen. Cornwallis sighs.
MARION: As long as your soldiers attack civilians, I will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement. And my men are excellent marksmen. Cornwallis sighs.
CORNWALLIS: Very well, let us move on to.
MARION: Prisoner exchange.
CORNWALLIS: You have eighteen of my men. I want them back.
MARION: You have eighteen of my men. I want them back.
CORNWALLIS: I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my What officers? Marion steps to the window, checks the view. A wooded hillside is visible in the distance. Marion reaches into his jacket. The Dragoons move on him. Marion extracts not a weapon, but a spyglass, which he hands to Cornwallis.
MARION: If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my What officers? Marion steps to the window, checks the view.

MARION: In the clearing, just down from the crest, to the left of the dark Cornwallis looks through the spyglass.
CORNWALLIS: Their names, ranks and posts?
MARION: They refused to give me their names. Their ranks are nine lieutenants, five captains, three majors and one fat colonel who called me a cheeky fellow. Their posts? We picked them up here-and-there last night. Cornwallis glares at Marion.
CORNWALLIS: You are not a gentleman. Marion can't help but laugh at the insult.
MARION: If your conduct is the measure of a gentleman, I take that as a Get my men. Cornwallis turns to Colonel Huntington.
CORNWALLIS: Arrange the exchange. Colonel Huntington leaves to do so.
MARION: Thank you, General. I'm sure your officers will thank you, as well. Marion salutes Cornwallis who doesn't return the salute. THEN MARION TURNS TO TARLETON. He walks up to him and looks him in the eye.
MARION: You don't remember me, do you? Tarleton examines Marion's face, finding him familiar, but unable to place him. then Tarleton remembers.
TARLETON: Ah, yes, that boy. Tarleton calmly holds Marion's glare.
TARLETON: Ugly business, doing one's duty.
MARION: Yes, ugly business. Marion takes a step closer to Tarleton, then speaks very softly, very slowly, very clearly.
MARION: If you are alive when this war is over, I'm going to kill you. Marion locks his eyes on Tarleton to make it perfectly clear that he means what he says. Tarleton tries to cover his reaction but it's apparent that he's taken aback by Marion's icy words. Marion turns and walks out. The two Great Danes start to follow, but Cornwallis SNAPS A COMMAND:
CORNWALLIS: Jupiter! Mars! THE DOGS FREEZE, looking after Marion, who doesn't turn back. The dogs reluctantly sidle over to Cornwallis' EXT. ASSEMBLY YARD - FORT CAROLINA - DAY Redcoats glare at Marion who sits, mounted, waiting. His eighteen men are led out of the prison blockhouse and directed to waiting horses. Surprised to be freed, they mount up. CORNWALLIS AND TARLETON step out onto the front porch of Cornwallis' headquarters and watch as Marion and his men ride toward the gate. THE TWO GREAT DANES, watch Marion from Cornwallis' side. Cornwallis motions to the Redcoat Sentries to OPEN THE GATES. They do so and Marion and his men, without hurrying, ride out. Then, just as the gates are closing behind him, Marion, without turning around, lets loose with a PIERCING
TARLETON: Take a detachment and go get our Wilkins hurries off.
CORNWALLIS: This fox believes himself clever. We shall see.
GASKINS: No one's been here for months.
WILKINS: No one's been here for months.
TARLETON: But now we have a name for our Colonel. Francis Marion. And with a name will come a family.
CAPTAIN MORROW: The Dragoons THUNDER UP THE STAIRS. Tarleton and Wilkins stride in, watching the search. the parlor. nothing. The kitchen. food is cooking. The dining room. the table is set, half-eaten food is on the plates, abandoned in mid-meal. TARLETON WALKS INTO THE DINING ROOM, touches some of the food, gauging its The Dragoons race outside.
UPSTAIRS!: The Dragoons THUNDER UP THE STAIRS. Tarleton and Wilkins stride in, watching the search. the parlor. nothing. The kitchen. food is cooking. The dining room. the table is set, half-eaten food is on the plates, abandoned in mid-meal. TARLETON WALKS INTO THE DINING ROOM, touches some of the food, gauging its The Dragoons race outside.
TARLETON: They can't be far. Check the outbuildings and the woods. The Dragoons race outside.
GABRIEL: It's all set. They follow Aaron, down an alley to A SHACK. Small. Barely standing. The children stop in their tracks, knowing this is to be their new home. Charlotte sees their hesitation. She walks up to the little structure, examining it with a critical eye. She looks on the doorway, seeing a single room, a dirt floor, wax-paper instead of glass in the windows, a rude, chimney-less fire-pit against the back wall. She smiles.
CHARLOTTE: This will do fine. She turns to Aaron and Abigail.
CHARLOTTE: Thank you. Charlotte walks inside without looking back. The children hesitate, then follow her inside.
CHARLOTTE: So he's the one they talk about, the Swamp Fox.
GABRIEL: I thought it might be him, the bits and pieces we heard, a veteran, fought in the French and Indian War, knows the swamps.
CHARLOTTE: I thought it might be him, the bits and pieces we heard, a veteran, fought in the French and Indian War, knows the swamps.
GABRIEL: They won't stop looking for you and the children.
CHARLOTTE: We'll be alright, here, for now. How is he? Gabriel searches for an honest answer.
GABRIEL: I don't know. I'm his son. Gabriel steps over to his saddlebags, opens his pack and pulls out a stack of letters which he hands to Charlotte.
GABRIEL: These are for you and the children. They sense someone behind them.
SUSAN: Why didn't father come? Gabriel is astonished to hear words coming from his heretofore silent sister. Charlotte nods, smiling.
CHARLOTTE: Speaking for months now.
SUSAN: Why didn't he come?
GABRIEL: He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men.
SUSAN: He left us.
GABRIEL: I know he did and he's sorry. He'll come back as soon as he can. Susan says nothing. Gabriel continues, hopefully.
GABRIEL: There are some letters here from him. Some are just to you.
SUSAN: I don't care. I hate him.
GABRIEL: You don't hate him.
SUSAN: Yes, I do. I hate him and I hope he never comes back. Gabriel kneels down and embraces her. She stands coldly with her arms at her sides.
MARION: She spoke? Susan spoke?
GABRIEL: Full sentences. As if she had been speaking all along.
MARION: I don't believe it. and I wasn't there for it. The cloud passes quickly.
MARION: Tell me everything she said, word for word. Gabriel hesitates.
GABRIEL: She said. she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her.
MARION: She said that? Oh, my Lord, she said Gabriel nods.
MARION: Isn't that something. Marion shakes his head at the thought, smiling to himself. Gabriel, uncomfortable with the lie, changes the subject.
GABRIEL: Father, there's something else I need to talk to you about.
MARION: Come with me. I'll tell you when we get there. Marion nods and curiously follows Gabriel.
GABRIEL: Come with me. I'll tell you when we get there. Marion nods and curiously follows Gabriel.
GABRIEL: Father, I'm looking for a best man. Marion is stunned but recovers quickly.
MARION: I'd be honored. They share a moment, then head down the aisle. Marion greets Anne's parents, shaking hands with her father and bowing to her mother. Abner, at the door, nods that the coast is clear.
REV. OLIVER: Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in the sight of God to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony. MARION feels every word, looking straight ahead but knowing that he's standing next to his son.
GABRIEL: Sir, I'd like to request a furlough. Two days?
MARION: Granted. Where are you going?
GABRIEL: Cheraw Falls.
MARION: It's beautiful there. Your mother and I were there once, before you were born.
GABRIEL: I know. They're silent for a moment.
MARION: She would have been pleased. Gabriel nods, then turns to his horse, unnecessarily checking his pack ropes. Anne joins them. Marion embraces her and gives her a fatherly kiss.
ANNE: I'm sorry we didn't give you more It's alright. I'm very happy for He helps her mount up. Abner, on guard near the road, motions them on. They all watch as Gabriel and Anne ride EXT. WOODED ROAD - NIGHT Marion, Rev. Oliver and Abner ride slowly down the road. It's a beautiful, moonlit night. Marion breaks the silence, speaking as much for himself as the others.

MARION: It's a good measure of a woman that she'll have her honeymoon under the For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do they Marion nods. They ride on.
REV. OLIVER: For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do they Marion nods. They ride on.
CORNWALLIS: From General Clinton in New York. ". your request to move north is denied until you have properly dealt with your militia problem." He underlined, 'militia'. "You have spent over six months dealing with a six-week problem. It is essential that you quell the Underlined again. ". insurgency, particularly because of the likely move south of Washington and the inevitable arrival of the French. Militia, as you have so often pointed out, is not worth the attention of a significant army, hence it is mystifying why militia has bedeviled you for so long." Tarleton smiles slightly, enjoying the show.
CORNWALLIS: ( reading ) ". it is my fervent hope that the vigor of your campaign comes to match the vigor of your correspondence with your Parliamentary and Court patrons. Only then might you share in the victory, on the verge of which I now ( beat ) "Your guardedly respectful Commander, General Sir George Cornwallis grows eerily calm and turns to Tarleton.
CORNWALLIS: If I fail, you fail.
TARLETON: And if I triumph, you triumph.
CORNWALLIS: And if I triumph, you triumph.
TARLETON: How can we end this madness?
CORNWALLIS: How can we end this madness?
TARLETON: Difficult, sir. This is, as you pointed out, a civil war. Cornwallis takes a moment, then speaks simply.
CORNWALLIS: Civility is a secondary virtue. It is superseded by duty.
TARLETON: I understand, sir. Tarleton salutes, yanks his reins, turning his horse, and rides off.
TARLETON: I believe they are almost ready.
GASKINS: I'm sorry, sir. He died. Tarleton sighs, irritated.
TARLETON: Very well, get one of the others. Gaskins and a couple of his men step into an attached woodshed where Billings sits, bound. They roughly grab him and drag him into the kitchen.
BILLINGS: Damn your eyes. Do your worst.
TARLETON: I intend to. They tie Billings to the table.
DALTON: You still want me to give wounded Redcoats quarter? Marion doesn't answer. Gabriel GALLOPS up. He reins back his lathered horse and speaks to them without dismounting.
GABRIEL: Tarleton has a list of our men, most are on it. A regiment of dragoons is going to the homes on the list, burning them, killing whomever resists, women and children, as Seven homes along the Black River so Rollins doesn't pause. He rushes to his horse, mounts up and rides off. Marion and the other men mount up and ride off fast after him.
MARION: Seven homes along the Black River so Rollins doesn't pause. He rushes to his horse, mounts up and rides off. Marion and the other men mount up and ride off fast after him.

REV. OLIVER: It's not time for vengeance, it's time to mourn and.
MARION: Five day furlough for all men. Abner, Dan, Reverend, spread the word. We'll reform at Acworth. Any man who doesn't come back won't be thought a coward or uncommitted to the cause. Attend to your families. The men mount up. Marion and Gabriel ride off together.
NATHAN: CHARLOTTE STEPS OUT OF THE SHADOWS, watching the reunion as Marion covers the children with kisses, trying to hug all of them at once as they cling to him as if they'll never let go. MARION AND CHARLOTTE LOCK EYES over the heads of the children.
WILLIAM: CHARLOTTE STEPS OUT OF THE SHADOWS, watching the reunion as Marion covers the children with kisses, trying to hug all of them at once as they cling to him as if they'll never let go. MARION AND CHARLOTTE LOCK EYES over the heads of the children.
MARION: Thank you. Charlotte smiles. Then Marion notices SUSAN peeking out from behind Charlotte's patched and mended skirt. He kneels down and opens his arms to her but she doesn't He smiles to her and speaks softly:
MARION: She looks coldly at Marion, tightens her grip on Charlotte's skirt and retreats further behind her. Marion looks to Charlotte who nods with guarded reassurance. Then his attention is drawn away by the demanding embraces of his other children.
MARGARET: I told you, things would get better. The children smile and dismount.
MARION: The overlook, up there should be where you post the watch. Work out a schedule. Short watches, especially at night. If you can catch some of those mockingbirds you can make cages and put them along there for alarms. Now let's find someplace to cache extra weapons. They follow Marion like soldiers.
MARION: Good apple. No response.
MARION: Very good. Sweet. He cuts a slice and offers it to her. She doesn't take it. He puts the slice between them. After a long moment she picks it up but as she's about to eat it, she stops, seeing something on it. She puts it back. Marion looks at the apple slice and sees a dark red splotch on it. He looks at his knife and realizes that it's dried blood. Off-balance, he turns to Susan who stares straight ahead, a thousand miles from Marion.
ANNE: May I ask you a question? Marion finishes with the knife and puts it away without Yes, of course. She speaks with a sly, withheld smile.
MARION: Yes, of course. She speaks with a sly, withheld smile.
ANNE: Do you think Frances with an "e" is too manly a name for a girl?
MARION: Do you think Francis with an "i" is too womanly a name for a boy?
ANNE: Do you think Francis with an "i" is too womanly a name for a boy?
MARION: Anne smiles and walks away. Marion figures out what she just told him.
ANNE: Anne smiles and walks away. Marion figures out what she just told him.
MARION: Late summer.
ANNE: Late summer.
MARION: Thank you. Marion laughs at the thought.
ANNE: Thank you. Marion laughs at the thought.
CHARLOTTE: I'm not my sister. Startled, Marion turns to Charlotte.
MARION: Excuse me?
CHARLOTTE: I said, I'm not my sister.
MARION: I know that.
CHARLOTTE: Do you?
MARION: Of course, I do.
CHARLOTTE: ( irritated ) Very well, then. She turns from him. Marion, tries to figure out what just happened. After a long moment he gets it. Stunned at first, his gears turn. After a very thoughtful moment he turns to Charlotte and offers a tentative smile. She rolls her eyes.
MARION: Just a little goodbye? One word? That's all I want to hear. Susan remains silent, standing with her arms at her sides, not responding to the embrace. Finally, Marion lets go of her. She just stares at him. Marion stands and turns to Charlotte.
MARION: Goodbye, Charlotte.
CHARLOTTE: They embrace. Though the hug is chaste, their eyes tell a different story. Only Anne and Margaret notice, but to them it's as clear as a bell. They exchange a knowing Marion and Charlotte break apart, self-consciously. Marion and Gabriel mount up and start to ride away. As they're about to round a curve and disappear, SUSAN CRIES
SUSAN: With halting steps, then faster and faster, she runs down the path toward Marion.
SUSAN: Papa, don't go, I'll say anything. Marion stops, turning in his saddle to see Susan running after him, her eyes filled with tears.
SUSAN: Please, Papa, I'll say anything you Marion yanks his reins, turning his horse.
SUSAN: Just tell me what to say! Tell me what to say! Marion spurs his horse straight toward her, GALLOPING toward the running, crying child.
SUSAN: Please, Papa, please don't go.
SUSAN: . I'll talk to you, I'll say anything you want, just tell me what you want me to say, I'll say anything, I promise, please, Papa, just stay. Marion envelopes the sobbing wisp of a girl, holding her, letting her cry, fighting his own tears. He reins back the horse, stopping in front of the He pleadingly looks to Charlotte who steps up to the horse. to take Susan. Marion gives Susan a final embrace, and covers her face with kisses.
MARION: I'll come back. I promise. Marion hands the still crying Susan down to Charlotte. Marion, in agony, averts his eyes, yanks his reins, and spurs his horse. As he rides away the children take off after him, running. Susan seeing the others running after Marion, struggles out of Charlotte's arms, and runs after them as well. Marion rides, now joined by Gabriel, faster and faster, leaving a trail of dust. The children slow, then stop, one after another, watching as they ride away.
MARION: How many came back?
REV. OLIVER: About a hundred and twenty. Less than a third. Marion nods. He and Gabriel join some of the men under one of the lean-to's.
REDCOAT SERGEANT: Excuse me, Ma'am, everyone has been requested to gather at the church.
ANNE: REDCOAT SERGEANT Colonel Tarleton wants to address, the whole village. The Redcoat Sergeant deferentially motions for Anne to follow him and his men. She sees several other townspeople, with Redcoat escorts, already heading down the street. She follows along.

REDCOAT: Into the church, please.
ANOTHER REDCOAT: Colonel Tarleton wishes to address all of you. Tarleton sees the last of the townspeople enter the church. He nods to the Redcoats near the door. The Redcoats CLOSE THE DOORS, chaining them shut. The DOOR IS POUNDED ON from the inside.
VOICE: Open this door!
ANOTHER VOICE: By what right are we made prisoners? TARLETON NODS TO GASKINS who, along with several rough- looking LOYALIST MILITIAMEN, disappear into the blacksmith shop. They reappear a moment later with FLAMING TORCHES and approach the church. Several Redcoats see what's about to happen and are appalled. Even some of the Green Dragoons, including Wilkins, are troubled. Wilkins rides over to Tarleton.
WILKINS: Yes, Major. Gaskins and the Loyalist Militia stop around the church, torches ready, waiting for the final go-ahead from Tarleton. The POUNDING AND CALLING from inside the church grows louder.
TARLETON: Yes, Major. Gaskins and the Loyalist Militia stop around the church, torches ready, waiting for the final go-ahead from Tarleton. The POUNDING AND CALLING from inside the church grows louder.
WILKINS: Sir, there is no honor in this.
TARLETON: The honor is found in the end, not the means. This will be forgotten. The Redcoats turn to the Redcoat Officers. The Redcoat officers turn to Wilkins, who struggles with himself. Tarleton calmly watches Wilkins' distress. Finally, Wilkins accepts it. Weakly steadying his horse, he takes his place next to Tarleton. The Redcoats and Dragoons follow his lead and watch as Gaskins and the Loyalist Militiamen light the church on fire, heaving their torches onto the roof, through the windows and under the raised foundation. SCREAMS are heard from inside. The DOOR THUDS with the shoulders of men trying to escape. The CHAINS HOLD. As the FLAMES RISE, another group of Loyalist Militiamen and some Redcoats drag half-a-dozen young women out of a Among the women, desperately pleading, kicking and screaming, is ANNE. The men drag her and the other women into the livery Tarleton watches them carried off, stone-faced. Then he turns and watches the church go up in FLAMES. A WINDOW SHATTERS, with a chair heaved from inside. SOME MEN TRY TO CLIMB OUT, but waiting Redcoats FIRE THEIR
GABRIEL: As Gabriel gets to the entrance of the livery stable, Marion walks out and intercepts him.
MARION: Don't go in there.
GABRIEL: Is it her? Is Anne in there?
MARION: She is. Don't go in there. Gabriel understands. he reels. growing faint. Marion grabs him. keeping him from falling. Marion holds Gabriel who begins to weep.
GABRIEL: Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?
MARION: You know what happened.
GABRIEL: No, I don't.
MARION: Everyone knows. It's what made me a hero. Me, Harry Lee, all of us. I got a medal. Men bought me drinks. They still do sometimes. Everyone knows what happened.
GABRIEL: Tell me what everyone doesn't know.
MARION: And what do they know?
GABRIEL: That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the That's right.
MARION: That's right.
GABRIEL: That's not enough. Tell me.
MARION: Your mother asked me the same question around the time you were born. I was drunk and I was foolish enough to answer her. Marion shakes his head to himself.
MARION: That's why it was four years between you and Thomas. It took me that long to regain her respect.
GABRIEL: I'm not my mother. I can't have the respect without the knowing. Marion's quiet for a moment. Then he speaks:
MARION: It was in '63. It was a bad time. The French and the Cherokee had raided along the Blue Ridge. All the English settlers took refuge at Fort Wilderness but the French captured it. We were sent in relief. Harry Lee, Billings, sixty of us. We already had something of a reputation for being. harsh. When we got there the fort was abandoned. Not a French soldier or Cherokee anywhere. They had left a week earlier. What we found was. Marion grows quieter with the memory of how bad.
MARION: They had left the settlers there. The men had been burned alive, the women were in pieces and the children were on stakes. Marion's silent for a moment.
MARION: We buried them, then we went to track. It was a cold trail and they were moving fast. We went faster. We caught up to them at Kentucky Go on.
GABRIEL: Go on.
MARION: We took our time with them and gave every one of them worse than they had given at the fort. It was two weeks before they were all dead, all except two. We put the heads on a pallet and had the two we let live take it to the French at Fort The eyes, fingers and tongues we put in a basket and sent that down the Asheulot to the Cherokee. The French stayed east of the Blue Ridge after that and the Cherokee broke their treaty with the French and stayed out of the fight. That seemed to make a difference. The war went another year, things went better. and men bought us Gabriel is silent. Marion looks at him closely.
MARION: It was a different time, son. And you're a better man than that.
GABRIEL: I see, do as I say, not as I do.
MARION: They hear HORSES HOOVES. Abner rides in from the opposite side of the village from the church, not having seen the results of the massacre. Excited, he dismounts.
ABNER: THEY'RE HERE! CONTINENTALS, THEY'RE Marion and Gabriel just look at him. Abner is confused by their reaction. Then he sees the remains of the church and the laid out, charred bodies.
HERE!: Marion and Gabriel just look at him. Abner is confused by their reaction. Then he sees the remains of the church and the laid out, charred bodies.
MARION: If this war is about more than Thomas, it's about more than Anne, as well. Stay the course.
GABRIEL: As you did at Fort Wilderness? Before Marion can answer they see HARRY LEE RIDE UP TO THEM. He dismounts, excited, voluble. He strides over, pleased to see Marion, oblivious to his and Gabriel's Look at you! I knew you could do Lee laughs, picks up a bottle and takes a big pull.
LEE: Look at you! I knew you could do Lee laughs, picks up a bottle and takes a big pull.
LEE: We have a chance! Better than a chance! Cornwallis is running to the Chesapeake, probably to meet his fleet at Yorktown. I wish I could see his face when he sees a dozen French ships floating there. And Washington should be a day or two behind him. And on top of everything, I have a son! Born last month in Alexandria. Gabriel rises and walks away. Lee finally tunes into the pall hanging over Marion and the just departed Gabriel. He turns to Marion.
MARION: His wife was killed yesterday. She was with child.
LEE: I'm sorry, I didn't know. Marion nods. They stand in silence. Lee hands Marion the bottle. He takes a drink.
DALTON: Gabriel and at least a dozen others. They must have left right after the watch change.
MARION: That means they have two hours on Marion strides to his horse. The other men follow him.
BROTHER JOSEPH: Fifty Green Dragoons, camped about a quarter mile from here. Sentries at four points. Suddenly they hear the SOUNDS OF MUSKETS FIRE ahead of them in the darkness. Marion takes off at a full run with his men right behind.
WILKINS: The DRAGOONS FIRE A MASSED VOLLEY, hitting Gabriel, Abner and several other Patriots. GABRIEL, BADLY WOUNDED, falls to his knees. The Dragoons pull their pistols about to fire again. Marion and his men OPEN FIRE. Staggering them. Marion sees Wilkins about to fire at Gabriel. Marion runs. Sees another Redcoat about to fire at Gabriel. MARION KILLS HIM with a pistol shot. Wilkins cocks his flintlock pistol, aims at Gabriel.

Wilkins cocks his flintlock pistol, aims at Gabriel.
GABRIEL: I'm alright, I. He tries to stand.
MARION: Let me help you. Gabriel weakens in Marion's arms. falters. Marion watches the life drain from Gabriel. He tries to hold the blood in, to no avail. Dalton plants himself next to Marion, defending him and Marion caresses Gabriel and watches as.
DALTON: Marion slowly stands and picks up Gabriel's body, cradling him like a child. They head off into the brush.
REV. OLIVER: May I help you try to find solace with the word of God? No response.
REV. OLIVER: Colonel, let us help his soul find it's place with the Almighty and.
MARION: He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?
REV. OLIVER: Yes, he does. Rev. Oliver pulls up a camp stool. He and Marion sit in EXT. MARION'S ENCAMPMENT - MORNING The Patriots, Continentals and Militia, are moving out. Most of the tents have been taken down. Wagons are rolling out. Companies of Continentals march off in good MARION'S TENT still stands. His men finish packing up, storing their heavy gear in wagons, tying their field gear onto their horses.
LEE: You have to bury him. No response.
LEE: I'll help you bury him. Lee moves toward Gabriel's body.
MARION: Don't touch him.
LEE: How many men have we seen die?
MARION: Two. Gabriel and Thomas.
LEE: They're gone. And there is nothing you or I can do to bring them back. But there is something you can do to help end all this.
MARION: It is ended.
LEE: No. It's not over yet. Two days ride, Yorktown, Virginia. Washington, the French, Cornwallis and Tarleton. It will end, one way or another. Francis, nothing will replace your sons but helping us will justify their sacrifice. Marion doesn't respond. Lee waits for a long moment, then he hears the SOUND OF THE DEPARTING TROOPS OUTSIDE THE
RUNNER: You called for me, sir? Marion reaches into his pocket and pulls out a single WALNUT which he hands to the boy.
MARION: Take this to General Washington. The boy looks at the walnut and then looks at Marion as if he's joking or crazy. He's neither. The boy shrugs and runs off with the walnut.
WASHINGTON: Did you bring me this?
RUNNER: Yes, sir. Washington scribbles something on a piece of paper and hands it to the boy.
WASHINGTON: Take this to Colonel Marion.
RUNNER: Yes, sir. The boy runs off. Washington smiles.
MARION: Colonel Francis Marion. Washington, leaning over the maps on his campaign table, hears the voice and turns around. The officers nearby stop and watch, curious.
MARION: Washington holds out a small bag to Marion who reaches in and pulls out a walnut.
WASHINGTON: Washington holds out a small bag to Marion who reaches in and pulls out a walnut.
WASHINGTON: Come. I have something I want to show you. Washington turns to his staff officers.
WASHINGTON: Washington and Marion walk off with Washington's officers and aides.As Washington and Marion walk, they both CRUSH THE WALNUTS SHELLS BETWEEN THEIR THUMBS AND FOREFINGERS, a prodigious display of strength that both men take for granted. They eat walnuts as they walk.
WASHINGTON: I was sorry to hear about your son.
MARION: I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen.
WASHINGTON: I've had no sons to lose, nor I lose the sons of other men. They look out at the vista, knowing that they're looking at the sons of thousands and thousands of other men.
WASHINGTON: Life was easier when we only had ourselves to get killed. They walk on, joining the others on the crest of the hill. The officers are looking out, some with spyglasses, at the British emplacements.
WASHINGTON: Gentlemen, what do we see?
HAMILTON: Mortars, center, with two lines of enfilading trenches.
PINKNEY: More along the right flank and behind the forward redoubts.
LAFAYETTE: A formidable defensive position. Very formidable.
HAMILTON: They could hold out for weeks. Washington nods and turns to Marion.
WASHINGTON: Francis, tell me about General Remember Braddock?
MARION: Remember Braddock?
WASHINGTON: That bad?
MARION: Proud, priggish and competent. A very bad combination in an Washington sighs.
WASHINGTON: Proud, priggish and competent. A very bad combination in an Washington sighs.
WASHINGTON: For those of you who don't know, we intercepted a British dispatch this morning. General Clinton has sailed from New York to relieve Cornwallis. That hits Washington's officers hard.
HAMILTON: How long before they arrive?
WASHINGTON: Less than a week. Sixteen ships and over nine thousand Redcoats.
LAFAYETTE: Sooner or later that message will get through to Cornwallis.
PINKNEY: And when it does, he'll just wait us And when the British ships arrive, the French ships will flee. And when the French ships flee, General Rochambeau and the French troops will flee as well. Marion speaks up.
WASHINGTON: And when the British ships arrive, the French ships will flee. And when the French ships flee, General Rochambeau and the French troops will flee as well. Marion speaks up.
MARION: Then you must let the message go They all turn to Marion, most of them looking at him as if he's insane.
WASHINGTON: If Cornwallis receives news that Clinton is coming, he'll simply hold tight and wait. He'll fight a purely defensive battle and he'll win that.
MARION: No, he won't. There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis. First, he is a very proud man, He would rather risk defeat than share a victory. If you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it.
WASHINGTON: And what is the second thing? Marion pulls Cornwallis' journal out of his haversack and leafs through it.
MARION: I'll let him tell you himself. ". but it is this colonial militia that is the most irksome. Not worthy of my attention, but demanding it; not worthy of British blood, but taking it; and not worthy of a soldier's honor, but sullying it. Those nights of mine that are not sleepless, are filled with dreams of a cavalry charge on the heels of fleeing farmers." Marion closes the journal.
MARION: He has no respect for citizen soldiers. That's your bait. Washington nods, considering it.
MAJOR HALBERT: Sir, a dispatch from General Clinton made it through the rebel lines. Cornwallis takes the dispatch and reads it. It staggers him. He sits down.
WILKINS: Cornwallis fumes. His jaw sets with anger. He slowly crumples the dispatch and speaks with quiet fury.
CORNWALLIS: Call a general staff meeting.
AIDE: Yes, sir.
MARION: The British army believes in officers. I believe in soldiers. After we engage, there will be no more orders. Every man here must know what I'm about to tell you. They listen closely.
MARION: We are the bait in a trap. We're militia. Cornwallis thinks we're rabble, nothing more than a bunch of undisciplined farmers. And if he thinks that's what we are, that's what we're going to give him. Listen up. They gather around closer.
CORNWALLIS: Do you see that, Colonel?
TARLETON: Unless I'm dreaming, I think I see irregulars at their center. Cornwallis and Tarleton exchange a pleased look.
CORNWALLIS: Fix bayonets. dispatch the Green The Signalman raises his semaphore flags and snaps the MARION AND HIS MEN are caught in the middle of the chaotic THE BRITISH LINE advances at a quickstep, bayonets From behind them, THE GREEN DRAGOONS appear, at a full gallop, Tarleton at their head.
THE BATTLEFIELD: It's an astonishing sight. total madness. hell. a painting by Hieronymous Bosch. The mass of the British infantry charges after the fleeing Patriot militiamen. The Redcoat infantry grows disorderly as it runs. TARLETON AND THE BRITISH CAVALRY THUNDERS to the head of the Redcoats, closing in on the fleeing Patriots. The cavalry swords are drawn and raised for a slaughter.
THEN SUDDENLY: Stepping into view from behind a low, grass covered rise, a SOLID LINE OF BLUE APPEARS, rock solid. It open up, allowing the fleeing Patriots to pass through it like water. then it closes again, becoming a solid blue wall.
DALTON: COLONEL! OUR LINE! Marion finishes reloading. distracted he turns to Dalton for an instant.
DALTON: OUR LINE IS FALTERING. Marion takes a quick glance at the Continental line, Scott, Rev. Oliver, Abner and a dozen more of his men, in the middle of a confused battle, with a larger mass of Redcoats who are advancing through the broken Continental MARION IS TORN. He looks to Tarleton, seeing him distracted, vulnerable but too distant a target for the pistol. Then Marion looks to Rev. Oliver and the others. Dalton can't wait. he runs off. Marion wavers. Then he takes a last look at Tarleton and heads off to help the faltering Patriots. TARLETON sees the movement of Marion and his men and sees Marion himself, his back exposed.
LEE: Goodbye, Francis.
MARION: Goodbye, Harry. Marion reaches down. They shake hands.
MARION: And congratulations on the birth of your son.
LEE: Thank you. Maybe all of this will buy him some peace.
MARION: I hope so. As Marion starts to ride off, he reins back and stops, speaking back to Lee over his shoulder.
MARION: Your son, what did you name him?
LEE: Robert. Robert E. Lee. Marion smiles.
MARION: A good name for a farmer. Lee nods. Marion rides off.
MARION: Two pounds, fourteen ounces.
CHARLOTTE: He smiles and make a minute adjustment in the chair's position. Then he sits down, settles back and begins rocking. Not a creak. Marion and Charlotte watch Susan run out of the yard, calling as she joins the other children.
SUSAN: Wait for me. As the CAMERA CRANES UP, Marion and Charlotte disappear beneath the overhang of the porch roof. Suddenly, the
