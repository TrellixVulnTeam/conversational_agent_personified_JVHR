SPIROS: It was so strange. Oh, James - more lemon son.
MRS PARRINGTON: Still so charming.
SPIROS: So, I'm sitting there watching the telly and suddenly I see Papadopoulos & Sons. On the TV.
THEO: Daddy over leveraged himself.
SPIROS: Look at this little Englezo. Hey! I'm your Uncle Spiros re. I'm your uncle, re manga! I'm going to eat him he's so Please don't eat me.

SPIROS: But we should be celebrating. Yeah? I don't drink anymore. Just so you know. But you don't have to be drunk to dance. That's what I say now. You don't have to be drunk to dance!
HARRY: Fantastic. So. Look. We're losing the house and well everything. It's only temporary. I'm in negotiations with a top corporate finance team to buy it back. But in the meantime, I need to free up some capital.
SPIROS: I'll give you whatever I've got but you know, I don't have much money.
HARRY: I don't want your money Spiro. I want to sell the Three Brothers. We'll split it 50/50. I get enough money pay the rent, pay a few bills off and it's great for you because you get some cash to do whatever it is you want to You can't sell the Three Brothers.
SPIROS: You can't sell the Three Brothers.
HARRY: I knew it! I knew you'd be difficult. I knew it, I knew it, I knew it. You haven't changed.
SPIROS: No, it doesn't feel right.

MRS PARRINGTON: Gentlemen, please. May I suggest we sleep on this? Before it gets out of Yeah. This is good advice Mrs P.
SPIROS: Yeah. This is good advice Mrs P.
MRS PARRINGTON: Harry? Harry?
HARRY: Okay. Whatever.
SPIROS: I couldn't sleep last night. Not a wink. Over and over, in my mind, I was trying to imagine selling the shop. Something here was saying, no, no. I want to help you. All of you. So I prayed for guidance. I asked the Universe. Please help me. Please help me help these people. And I must've fallen asleep not long after. A crazy sleep. And then this dream. Banayia mou. There was this, this music. The most incredible music. And you and me Harry. Running the shop. I woke with tears in my eyes and I knew.
HARRY: Sorry. What are you going on about?
SPIROS: We are going to reopen the Three Is he talking about us?
THEO: Is he talking about us?
KATIE: Is he talking about us?
JAMES: Yeah, I think he is.
HARRY: There's nothing there.
SPIROS: Exactly. It's empty. Useless. We'd get nothing for it. But if we made the Three Brothers great again. Hey! That is our destiny! Okay. It needs work. Sure. But destiny need work.
HARRY: You're still crazy.
SPIROS: We have. You. You have a better chance of getting through this if we increase the value of the shop.
HARRY: I'm not opening a fish and chip shop, I'm Papadopoulos & Sons, I'm on supermarket shelves.
KATIE: God. What would I tell my friends?
JAMES: Don't know, maybe the truth?
KATIE: ( Mimicking ) I don't know, maybe the God. Fuck off.
JAMES: God. Fuck off.
KATIE: F.. f.. fuck you.
MRS PARRINGTON: People! Hear me out. If we get it up and running again, we can sell it as a going concern instead of an empty shop. This deal you're working on could take ages. In the meantime, you're getting cash in and you're saving money because it's got two bedrooms. Eh? The Three Brothers is a goldmine. Used to be. Can be again.

SPIROS: Let's go look at the shop. Let me go and start working on it now.
HARRY: You're out of your mind. I know what you're up to. You want to make some money for yourself. That's fine. It's okay. It's okay. At least you're thinking smart these days. But don't involve us in all I want to help.
SPIROS: I want to help.
MRS PARRINGTON: Given the current situation, I think it's worth consideration.
HARRY: What? I'm not opening a fish and chip shop. I'm not. I'm not! I'm not! I'm not! Not! Not! What?
MRS PARRINGTON: May I have a private word? Now.
MRS PARRINGTON: You're behaving like a child.
HARRY: Mrs Parrington, with all due You are the father of this family.
MRS PARRINGTON: You are the father of this family.
HARRY: I'd rather boil my own head than go back to a chip shop.
MRS PARRINGTON: What a terrible thing to say. Really.
HARRY: He's unreliable Mrs P. He's irresponsible, he's a talker. He sings. He dances. He plays the bongo drums. He's a waiter. He'll drive us all mad and leave us broke.
MRS PARRINGTON: He seems reformed to me. He doesn't drink anymore. I think he wants to Moving back to a chip shop will destroy my children's confidence.
HARRY: Moving back to a chip shop will destroy my children's confidence.
MRS PARRINGTON: Seeing you behave like a spoilt brat will do that perfectly well.
HARRY: We're going to smell of fish and The children need a home. I don't give a fig for your bourgeois snobbery. Look at you. Everything has to be a drama with you Greeks. Show some gumption man.
MRS PARRINGTON: The children need a home. I don't give a fig for your bourgeois snobbery. Look at you. Everything has to be a drama with you Greeks. Show some gumption man.
SPIROS: So many memories.
KATIE: Are we really going to live in that?
THEO: I'm trying to find something good.
JAMES: I'm trying to find something good.
KATIE: No. Nothing.
JAMES: No. Nothing.
SPIROS: Nonsense. You'll love it! We're going to have a crazy time. We're going to fix this place up. I'm going to teach you how to do some Greek dancing, some singing. We'll fry some good fish. We'll laugh. Good times.
HASSAN: I don't believe it.
MEHMET: The Greeks are back.
HASSAN: The Greeks are back.
MEHMET: What Greeks?
HASSAN: Those Greeks. Hello my old friends. Mehmet. Find out what they're up to.

( Silence ) It's good to have these little chats. Shouldn't always be about work. Society is so work obsessed. Tragic. Right. Back to work.
HARRY: Some big names.
ROB: ( CONTINUED )
HARRY: What's the potential deal structure?
ROB: That's the pisser.
SOPHIE: You'd still be key to running the business, but.
HARRY: Money isn't cheap Harry. These guys will want at least 95% of the company.
ROB: Money isn't cheap Harry. These guys will want at least 95% of the company.
HARRY: Leaving me with nothing. I'd do the same thing. I'd be CEO of Papadopoulos & Sons. Get a salary. Get my house back. My children's It beats fish and chips.
ROB: It beats fish and chips.
SOPHIE: You'd be working for someone else.
HARRY: I'd be working for someone else. By the way, I'm not actually running a fish and chip shop. Just helping my brother relaunch.
ROB: Sure. Listen, there maybe another way. Came up in conversation with the Norske Velconan Bank. It'd be along the lines of a straight loan to buy back the business.
HARRY: Why would they lend me the money?
ROB: Well. Let's ask them. Want me to look into it?
HARRY: Sure, no choice.
ROB: Okay. Cool. Got to go. Got an emergency with - get this - a high tech portable toilet company - that has literally gone down the tubes. ( ROB holds up a flyer for the company ) An internet ready, wireless, crapper with a waterproof keyboard and screen. For the love of God. Because taking a dump needed an overhaul. Still, somebody's got to bury them. Inomine patre, Spiritu, Sanctu. etc, etc.
SOPHIE: Got to love a downturn.
ROB: ROB exits. SOPHIE starts to pack her files.
SOPHIE: I think what you're currently doing with your brother sounds liberating.
HARRY: I'm liberating myself of my last 25 grand on a disused chip shop.
SOPHIE: But its like a startup. Isn't that the most exciting phase of any venture? Taking a bit of a risk. Developing your products and your services. Learning about your market. Look, some of the largest companies on the planet never make a profit. Like a real profit. It's all accounting tricks and leveraged debt. What I'm trying to say is, does it matter if the business is a small one? As long as it makes a profit and the people who work there are happy?
HARRY: What are you doing working in a place like this?
SOPHIE: This is only temporary. I got divorced recently. Came to London for a fresh start. I'm actually looking into setting up my own business.
HARRY: Well, I'm sorry about that. About the divorce, I mean. Not.
SOPHIE: I've been meaning to ask. Can I come and visit your shop sometime?
HARRY: There isn't one.
SOPHIE: When it's up and running.
HARRY: It's a chip shop. It's hot. On your feet all hours. Verbal abuse from customers on a Friday night.
SOPHIE: I wasn't applying for a job Harry. Just wanted to stop by.
SPIROS: It's late. What are you doing little Trading. I watch trends. Making trades based on patterns. I don't even look at the fundamentals.
THEO: Trading. I watch trends. Making trades based on patterns. I don't even look at the fundamentals.
SPIROS: The fundamentals?
THEO: You know, capital employed, gearing ratios etc. Not even turnover or profit. It's short term, but I can spot a trend. I know what's going to So, you can see the future? And?
SPIROS: So, you can see the future? And?
THEO: Same as the past. The pursuit of order from chaos. I'm done for today.

THEO: Uncle Spiros? You knew my Mummy.
SPIROS: Yes. She was. She was beautiful. And she was very kind to me.
THEO: I wish I had my Mummy sometimes.
SPIROS: It's very hard for you.
THEO: I'd have made her laugh, Uncle Spiro.
SPIROS: You make me laugh.
THEO: I've come out with some classics. Real gems. Wasted on this family.
SPIROS: Ha! You are something else.
KATIE: We can hear everything..
JAMES: Don't fall for him Spiros. He's a little tinker.
KATIE: Say the magic release poem!
THEO: Actually, say it the magic release Theo Papadopoulos is a hippopotamus, who's always making such a fuss from his top to bottomus!!!
JAMES: Actually, say it the magic release Theo Papadopoulos is a hippopotamus, who's always making such a fuss from his top to bottomus!!!
THEO: KATIE/ JAMES
SPIROS: Ah, your kids are something else.
HARRY: Remember how excited we felt when we got this place? It feels like that again. Hey. My gut says. push Alaskan Pollock. Over Cod! What do you I should never have taken out that Ah. We'll talk fish after we fix this place. ( Singing ) We'll talk fish after we fix this place. Katie's got some good thoughts. Says we should keep the old look. And she had some beautiful ideas about the uniforms.

HARRY: But then, you know. The potential yield of the Plaza. Papadopoulos Plaza. Fully developed with a thousand year lease. I would have kept the freehold. I'm telling you Spiro. It was good. I'd have been worth a fortune. Worth, I don't know. One billion five. One billion six. One billion six. Big numbers Spiro. Big, big numbers.
SPIROS: We were children when we came to the UK with nothing. We start again. Fat Laki. The weight you lost is an inspiration. Phil The Till. You've helped many Greeks with your tax friendly till machines. Eh, only two things are certain in life - death and taxes. Unless you're Greek. Then it's only death! ( The crowd cheer ). Nikos, Kyriaco, Androniki, Loula, Uncle Panikos, Aphrodite, Maria and of course, Father Jimmy. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
HARRY: Didn't Father Jimmy get done for selling illegal copies of Rambo?
SPIROS: He's got three liquor stores in Palmers Green.
HARRY: He always hated me.
UNCLE PANIKOS: What did he say?
UNCLE PANIKOS: James, music. Thank you. I officially announce the renovation of the Three You're supposed to do that after you launch something.
SPIROS: James, music. Thank you. I officially announce the renovation of the Three You're supposed to do that after you launch something.
HARRY: You're supposed to do that after you launch something.
SPIROS: To hell with convention.
SPIROS: Hade re Laki. Tell us.
FAT LAKI: Entaxi. Don't rush me. Its been a long time since I had meat like this.
THEO: What's he doing?
MRS PARRINGTON: He's assessing the competition.
SPIROS: E belame mas ( He's driving us crazy ).
FAT LAKI: There's a reason Hassan's still in business. Texture, very good. Way above average. Meat content. High. Mechanically recovered cheap rubbish? You wish. This is a quality donner, nicely cooked with all the right combination of herbs. It's beautiful.
SPIROS: It doesn't mean we can't take them on.
FAT LAKI: No. I'm not saying we can't.
HARRY: Sorry. I. I.
MEHMET: Sorry. I. I.
HARRY: What do you want?
MEHMET: That's a lot of Greeks.
KATIE: What? We're going out.
MRS PARRINGTON: Not too late.
HARRY: We'll make a better product at a cheaper price with larger portions. We'll lose money on the kebabs in the short term, put Turks out of business within a year, make our margins on the fish and when the rest of this crummy street has packed up we'll raise our prices and cut our portion sizes.
SPIROS: The entrepreneur has spoken.
HARRY: Hey, it's temporary, but as long as we're here we'll do some business.
SPIROS: You know, when he was a little boy, he'd come home from school and sit there - just like that.
JAMES: Who was the third b.. brother?
HARRY: Michael. He died in the fire. With our parents, your grandparents, in Cyprus. In the war between the Greeks and How did you both escape?
JAMES: How did you both escape?
HARRY: Spiros climbed down and Michael who was. six?
SPIROS: Dropped me down. I was just a baby.
HARRY: Dropped me down. I was just a baby.
SPIROS: I caught him. But Michael. He. I told Mihalis to jump. But he. he ran right back into the house. We'll never know why. One night and everything He probably wanted to save his Mum and You know what? I never thought about that. You could be right. Yeah. You are a wise boy James. Your soul is old. Tell me. This has always been a big question for me. For many years. Do you think. do you think. I could've done something else? For Michael?
JAMES: He probably wanted to save his Mum and You know what? I never thought about that. You could be right. Yeah. You are a wise boy James. Your soul is old. Tell me.

JAMES: No. You were holding a baby.
SPIROS: And how old were you?
JAMES: And how old were you?
SPIROS: I was nine.
JAMES: Well, you were only a boy. Like Theo.
SPIROS: H? Hello? What's wrong with him? Hey. Don't worry. It's temporary!
HARRY: Excuse me.
SPIROS: Did I say something wrong?
HARRY: He was only nine. I never thought about how young he was.
JAMES: I got you this. Tea.
HARRY: James. Come here. Sit down. I've let you and your brother and your sister I made a promise to your mother that I'd take care of you.
JAMES: I made a promise to your mother that I'd take care of you.
HARRY: I made a promise to your mother that I'd take care of you.
JAMES: And you're doing that.
HARRY: This is humiliating for you.
JAMES: Dad, we'll get through this. Like. I don't know. Like King Lear.
HARRY: I don't know the story.
JAMES: Well, King Lear loses everything. Absolutely everything and he finds himself in the middle of this storm with nothing and all his kids h.. h.. hate him. They think he's a prick.
HARRY: What happens to him?
JAMES: Well. He dies.
HARRY: But it has to end like that because its a tragedy.
JAMES: But it has to end like that because its a tragedy.
HARRY: I'm sorry about your plants.
JAMES: I can grow new ones.
HARRY: Why didn't you bring more with you?
JAMES: I didn't want to get in the way.
HARRY: You're such a sweet boy. You get that from your mother. Your stammer is getting better. You know what? I'm going to go and get your plants. Now. From the house.
JAMES: What? Right now?
HARRY: I'm going to get your plants. Like King Lear. Yes?
JAMES: Er. Yeah. Sort of.
THEO: Hello. What's going on?
HARRY: Hello. What's going on?
JAMES: We're making b.. batter.
SPIROS: Uncle Spiros' special mix.
HARRY: That's all I could find.
JAMES: Thank you.
HARRY: It's very late.
SPIROS: I said they could help.
KATIE: It is the holidays.
THEO: Uncle Spiros said I could make beer and vodka batter.
SPIROS: It doesn't sound very good.
HARRY: Hey. You can stay up. It's the holidays. Tomorrow, we'll look through the newspapers and pick out some stocks. How does that grab you?
THEO: Natural resources is a good buy.
KATIE: Hey, wait. Show us your frying skills.
SPIROS: I was telling them how you were born with a timer in your head. How you fried to perfection every time.
HARRY: Not tonight.
JAMES: Come on Dad, show us how to fillet a Go on Daddy.
KATIE: Go on Daddy.
SPIROS: Yes H. Come on. Show us. Show us. Show us! Show us!
HARRY: You should really be thinking about bed, all of you. Good night.
SPIROS: HARRY exits. SPIROS tastes his batter and is happy.
SPIROS: Alright, that's it. Where we going?
HARRY: City. Get a loan. Get the business back, get the house back. Does this suit look alright?
SPIROS: Yeah. It's a suit.
HARRY: It doesn't. I don't know. It doesn't
HARRY CONT: I don't believe it. They're kissing.
SPIROS: Ah. Kids. Come on.
HARRY: In the street?
SPIROS: They're smoking. They're hanging out.
HARRY: Are they? Are they?
SPIROS: Are they screwing?
HARRY: Are they screwing?
SPIROS: No. They're just kissing.
HARRY: I've got to get out of this place.
SPIROS: Come on. He's a sweet guy.
HARRY: Out! The family is in the gutter.
SPIROS: You're overreacting Harry.
HARRY: The thought of her pregnant. In a kebab shop.
SPIROS: Harry. Don't worry about Katie. She can look after herself.
HARRY: What are you doing?
SPIROS: I've got something to say.
HARRY: About Katie? Is she pregnant?
SPIROS: Oh God. Have you've got cancer?
HARRY: Oh God. Have you've got cancer?
SPIROS: SPIROS pulls out eight or nine A4 pages of hand written notes. He takes out his reading glasses. Reading the piece of paper.
HARRY: What now?
SPIROS: ( Reading ) There were aspects of my behaviour which were unacceptable. This includes, and is not limited to.
HARRY: Why now?
SPIROS: I've been carrying this. Well, if you don't want to hear we can do it later.
HARRY: No. Now is fine. Now is good.
SPIROS: Just. ( Reading note paper and turning over pages ) Oxi. Oxi. Skip that. ( Beat ) I have abused your I agree with that statement.
HARRY: I agree with that statement.
SPIROS: When we were children and got to London I looked after you. Got you ready for school. Made you do your homework. I taught you to cook, ride a bike, speak Greek. Dance. ( Beat ) Why don't you speak Greek re?
HARRY: You were reading your list.
SPIROS: I fought with Stephen Klein, when he accused you of stealing his orthopedic shoe. Remember that?
HARRY: Did you take it?
SPIROS: Did you take it?
HARRY: You can tell me now.
SPIROS: You can tell me now.
HARRY: I didn't steal the shoe. Are you going to read all of that?
SPIROS: I don't have to.
HARRY: Why did it go wrong with us Spiro? We may as well get to it. Why did you turn against me after I left the shop?
SPIROS: I never turned against you.
HARRY: That's what it felt like.
SPIROS: I was jealous of you.
HARRY: You were my brother.
SPIROS: Brothers get jealous.
HARRY: You were more than a brother.
SPIROS: You were my life and then you left. I set up the business. I wasn't going to stay in the shop. You could've come with me.
HARRY: I set up the business. I wasn't going to stay in the shop. You could've come with me.
SPIROS: Harry, you were so fast. You were like a plane, like a supersonic But I gave you everything you wanted. Did I ever once turn you down? In all the years after I left the business. Did I? And after it went bust? But it was never enough. Every week something new. Writing a cheque to. I don't know. You had some weird friends. Who was that bloke with the pin head? Kept turning up at the house.
HARRY: But I gave you everything you wanted. Did I ever once turn you down? In all the years after I left the business. Did I? And after it went bust? But it was never enough. Every week something new. Writing a cheque to. I don't know. You had some weird friends. Who was that bloke with the pin head? Kept turning up at the house.
SPIROS: None of my friends anymore.
HARRY: And then drunk at Elizabeth's funeral? And your big 'tell it as it is' I heard about it.
SPIROS: I heard about it.
HARRY: That was it for me. For us.
SPIROS: You were right to cut me off.
HARRY: She never had a bad word for you Elizabeth. Always forgave you. And she made me forgive you. Every time.
SPIROS: She did. I always had a way back when she was with us. Elizabeth was so good to me. She was our world. She was our world.
HARRY: I'm sorry, I can't.
SPIROS: It's okay H.
HARRY: I've got to get to this meeting. It's an important meeting.
SPIROS: It's okay to miss her.
HARRY: Oh man. ( Silence ) Just give me a
ROB: With the help of Lars and the Norske Velconan Bank, we aim to buy Pap and Sons back from the receivers.
LARS: Also, I have to say Harry that I believe there is an intuitive bond between the Greek and the Nordic peoples, yah? And so, maybe the very first vikings were descended from Ancient Greeks, somewhere in the deep mists of time. And so it's so. so Wagnerian, yah?
SOPHIE: We should point out the new approach.
ROB: To buy Papadopoulos the food manufacturing side of the Divest the food manufacturing? What else is there?
HARRY: Divest the food manufacturing? What else is there?
ROB: Sell off the food but keep the Papadopoulos Plaza. It's going to be worth a fortune.
LARS: Papadopoulos Plaza. It's going to be worth a fortune.
HARRY: That's not what I had in mind.
SOPHIE: It's an asset breakup.
LARS: Tusk. Tusk, yah? Makes us sound like With the new loan, you'd buy back your old assets and then sell off the brands in the Pap & Sons stable.
ROB: With the new loan, you'd buy back your old assets and then sell off the brands in the Pap & Sons stable.
LARS: Yah. And you know how to squeeze the value Harry.
SOPHIE: That's a break up.
HARRY: Please. I know what it is.
LARS: The pitta bread, the cakes get sold to a bakery.
ROB: The halloumi and feta to a dairy I love your halloumi! Grilled. It's. ( Kisses air )
LARS: I love your halloumi! Grilled. It's. ( Kisses air )
ROB: The sell off value of these brands will exceed the new loan.
LARS: So my bank will get its money back faster than you can say 'knife'.
HARRY: And what do you get?
ROB: Lars wants 50% of the Plaza development. Which is what will remain after the debts have been settled.
HARRY: So you get 50% of the development for Sure, yeah. But you get 50% of the same development yah, also for What do you want Harry?
LARS: Sure, yeah. But you get 50% of the same development yah, also for What do you want Harry?
SOPHIE: What do you want Harry?
HARRY: I want my food business back.
ROB: Guy, guys, guys. Reality check. Harry. It's not going to happen. Okay? The best you can hope for is to work with Lars here and save something.
HARRY: I can't say no.
LARS: Okay. So. Yah. I need to take this to the board. Take two, three months. But pish, yah?
SOPHIE: It seems criminal to buy the business back only to break it up.
ROB: Can I just point out that you are skating. Figuratively speaking. On thin fucking ice.
HARRY: I'll do whatever the bank wants.
LARS: Okay! Harry, we are going to take this to the hoop, yah? Three points! Yah? Three points!
SOPHIE: Taking out a loan to pay off a loan? So you can remortgage a property? It's got nothing to do with business. It's got nothing to do with making stuff.
HARRY: I get my life back.
SOPHIE: No. You get a loan for some land.
HARRY: My children get their lives back.
SOPHIE: I'm sorry. This isn't very Do you give all your clients a hard time Sophie?
HARRY: Do you give all your clients a hard time Sophie?
SOPHIE: No. Just the interesting ones.
HARRY: You got five minutes?
SOPHIE: Yeah. Of course.
HARRY: Just want to talk about the shop and make sure my brother's got the right plan before I go.
SOPHIE: Okay. Let's grab a coffee.
SOPHIE: So it's 30% on materials. The fish, the potatoes, the packaging etc. Would you include energy? Light, heat?
HARRY: Yeah. But not rent because we already own the building.
SOPHIE: Okay. And 30% on labour?
HARRY: So it's 30/30/30. Classic restaurant That's right.
SOPHIE: So it's 30/30/30. Classic restaurant That's right.
HARRY: That's right.
SOPHIE: What are your weaknesses?
HARRY: The price of fish can vary. Can you vary the menu?
SOPHIE: Can you vary the menu?
HARRY: You don't want to complicate it.
SOPHIE: It doesn't have to be complicated Harry. ( Beat ) What are your fears?
HARRY: My fears? Oh. Just that it just won't work out. That fish and chips has maybe had its day.
SOPHIE: No. Hang on a second. ( They stop ) Fish and chips is a British classic. It's much more than just a quick meaningless experience. It's something to be savoured. Just think of the soft, white, cod flakes, gently falling away as your fork pierces the hard, crunchy shell of the golden batter. The rich smells of a fryer's delight. The tangy smack of salt and vinegar on your lips. Hell yeah. I'd pay for that.
HARRY: Yes. We should
MEHMET: This time last year I was in We'll go tonight.
KATIE: This time last year I was in We'll go tonight.
MEHMET: We'll go tonight.
KATIE: It's not a nightclub. It's America.
MEHMET: Oh. Look. The shop's where I'm from but it's not where I'm going to end My Dad must've said that to my Mum once. Maybe even on this bridge.
KATIE: My Dad must've said that to my Mum once. Maybe even on this bridge.
MEHMET: See. Look where he ended up?
KATIE: So, what's your plan?
MEHMET: Property. Got an eye for it.
KATIE: I'll probably be a pop star one Yo, yo, yo! It's time to die. Yo, yo, blue bottle fly.
MEHMET: Yo, yo, yo! It's time to die. Yo, yo, blue bottle fly.
KATIE: Yo, yo, yo! It's time to die. Yo, yo, blue bottle fly.
MEHMET: That is well sick!
KATIE: Yeah. I wrote something for you too. It's a poem. It's called, 'Sometimes I want for nothing else'. Just you and me. In an ever expanding Universe. Sharing a cup of tea. Sometimes, I want for nothing else.
MEHMET: Fuck. You're amazing.
MRS PARRINGTON: Lovely. Come and try. Fresh fish. Lovely hot chips. Come and try. Little boy. Battered inside. Special chip for you? And one for you. Fish and chips, come and try. We batter our own fish.
HASSAN: It's not just fish and chips.
SPIROS: There's room for all of us.
HARRY: What do you want Hassan?
HASSAN: Remember when we were children? When we were friends. We weren't Greeks, Turks. Respectfully, I would like you to take your kebabs off the menu. This is a fish and chip shop.
SPIROS: What do we get?
HASSAN: I won't do fish.
HARRY: You don't do fish Hassan.
HASSAN: You are going to put us on the street.
HARRY: It's business.
HASSAN: It's not about business. Perhaps you would not be like this if we were I'll tell you what. We'll take kebabs off the menu, if you ask your son to stay away from my daughter.
HARRY: I'll tell you what. We'll take kebabs off the menu, if you ask your son to stay away from my daughter.
SPIROS: More tea?
HASSAN: No. Thank you. This is very Come on. It's easy.
HARRY: Come on. It's easy.
HASSAN: My son is his own man.
HARRY: Right. There's no deal.
HASSAN: Is this because he's Turkish? Because he's a Muslim?
HARRY: Oh no. I don't have a problem with Harry's not like that.
SPIROS: Harry's not like that.
HASSAN: Because he works in a kebab shop? Is that it?
SPIROS: Yeah. Harry's more like that.
HARRY: I would ask you - both of you - to respect a man's aspiration for his I have similar aspirations for my son. Spiro, perhaps you should remind your brother where he is now. Tell him to look around. Perhaps he still sees a big mansion with gardens and servants. Well, I don't. But more importantly, neither does my son.
HASSAN: I have similar aspirations for my son. Spiro, perhaps you should remind your brother where he is now. Tell him to look around. Perhaps he still sees a big mansion with gardens and servants. Well, I don't. But more importantly, neither does my son.
HARRY: This is only. We'll be gone in a couple of months.
HASSAN: I hope so. It's going to be a very long couple of months.
HARRY: For both of us.
THEO: Say cheese!
HARRY: So, here we are.
SPIROS: Here we are.
MRS PARRINGTON: I'm sure it will be good news.
HARRY: If it's good news Spiro, I want you to have the shop. All of it.
THEO: Will we get to visit Uncle Spiros Yes, of course we will.
MRS PARRINGTON: Yes, of course we will.
SPIROS: Who's going to help me to run the store? I'm going to need you little I expect Uncle Spiros will always find you a holiday job here.
MRS PARRINGTON: I expect Uncle Spiros will always find you a holiday job here.
HARRY: Hello. Lars. Yeah. I'm just.
MRS PARRINGTON: What is it?
THEO: Did you get the loan?
HARRY: Bad news I'm afraid.
KATIE: Yeah. We're going home! We got it! We're going home.
HARRY: Yeah. We're going home! We got it! We're going home.
SPIROS: What's wrong? We're leaving, we're out of here. We got the loan. We should be
HARRY: What's wrong? We're leaving, we're out of here. We got the loan. We should be
SPIROS: He's right. It's a good day. You, you made it. You're a survivor. Sorry.
HARRY: What is it with you Spiro? Why can't you be happy for me? Whenever I have any kind success you always have to stamp on it. ( Spiros gets up ) Where are you going?
SPIROS: I am happy for you. I am.
HARRY: What is it? What's wrong?
SPIROS: There is this.
THEO: He looks dead to me.
MRS PARRINGTON: No, he's not dead. He's sleeping. He's still sleeping.
THEO: Like sleeping beauty?
MRS PARRINGTON: Yes. That's a good way of looking at it.
SOPHIE: Sorry. I hope I'm not.
HARRY: No, no. Come in. ( Indicating to James to get a chair ) James, James. And take the erm. ( Refering to cake )
SOPHIE: Yeah, I heard the news and I really wanted to bake something so I made a Greek Easter cake. Don't ask.
HARRY: No. That's really. lovely. Thank you very much. We'll, we'll have some of that. He's in a mild coma apparently and we have to talk to him and play music and. James, put the. turn the music on. ( To SPIROS ) Hey, wake up. The accountant's here. You've got to wake up.
KATIE: Jesus Christ!
MRS PARRINGTON: Sorry. It won't turn off.
JAMES: Sorry. It won't turn off.
KATIE: You're such a spanner!
JAMES: Fuck off slag.
MRS PARRINGTON: Katie! James!
THEO: Let me do it!
HARRY: Wait! I can felt something. Katie. Get the doctor.
KATIE: I don't want to ask.
JAMES: Oh for fuck's sake, I'll go shall I?
HARRY: Doctor. I felt something just now. A gripping movement.
DOCTOR: Anything else?
HARRY: No, just a slight squeeze, is that a sign?
DOCTOR: It could be a decorticate response. It's difficult to tell.
HARRY: Right. How long's he going to be like He's suffered a heart attack. It's hard to predict. You should all take a break. I'm sorry about him.
DOCTOR: He's suffered a heart attack. It's hard to predict. You should all take a break. I'm sorry about him.
MRS PARRINGTON: Yeah. Okay. We'll leave you to it. Come on. We'll just say goodbye to Uncle Spiros.
HARRY: Would you mind staying around?
SOPHIE: Of course.
HARRY: So, he saved me twice. Once in the fire, and once after the banks. I was always embarrassed by him, you know. By his thing that he does. You know, his. 'thing'. But the thing that he does. It's a good thing really. These last few months. This year actually. This whole year. God. What a year. What a year. And yet. I've never felt so alive. I've never felt so engaged. Why is that? I mean why? I mean, I'm frying chips.
SOPHIE: It's okay. It's okay.
HARRY: It's a crazy, crazy, world. It's up, it's down. You fight. You win.
SOPHIE: I'll get someone.
HARRY: Spiro mou. Spiro mou.
SPIROS: Ella bethi mou. Ella tho. You have to let me go. It's good. Michael's with us. Michael. O Mihalis. He was always there. Always with us. Always. Three brothers.
HARRY: When I was a little boy. You cooked for me. Every time I came home. They were good times Spiro. Itan Kali zoi. A good life. Now you understand. Levendis mou.
SPIROS: Itan Kali zoi. A good life. Now you understand. Levendis mou.
HARRY: Did you do this?
JAMES: It was for you. And Uncle Spiros. And Thank you James.
HARRY: Thank you James.
JAMES: This is the Ivy you saved, that night.
HARRY: We meet again.
JAMES: They can all go back to the house if you want. The plants. They're quite easy to move. But they're also very happy to grow here as well. If we choose to stay.
KATIE: It's whatever you want to do Daddy. We're all really proud of you.
HARRY: Theo mou. Good day at school?
MRS PARRINGTON: Very good day. Impressed the teacher with his ability to solve quadratic That is fantastic.
HARRY: That is fantastic.
THEO: Your friends are outside.
ROB: As you won't come to me, I thought I'd come to you.
HARRY: I'm not changing my mind Rob.
ROB: I just want to talk.
ROB: Tell me this is a joke.
HARRY: I don't want to do the deal.
ROB: Harry, you have seriously lost the plot on this one.
HARRY: It just doesn't feel right.
ROB: We worked hard on this.
SOPHIE: If he doesn't want to do the deal, he doesn't want to do it.
ROB: Shut up.
HARRY: Hey. No need for that.
ROB: I don't understand.
HARRY: I've got everything I want. And I've got no debt. And that feels good. When I lock up my shop at night, it feels good. I've got no debts, no loans. I own it 100 per cent.
ROB: Come on. A percentage of something that could be worth millions. You'd walk away from that? For a chip shop?
