As they tumble off the counter onto the floor, Alex gets in several furious punches before Lou's gang can pry him loose. Two of the gang pin Alex against the counter. Wiping blood from his mouth, Lou grins maliciously and slugs Alex in the stomach. The boy groans and doubles over. Lou grabs Alex's hair and slams his head back against the glass shield of the counter. As Lou rears back to throw another punch, his two friends suddenly release Alex and scatter. The boy crumples to the floor. Lou turns around to see two MALE TEACHERS rapidly approaching. The larger teacher grabs Lou.

KIM: My mother's all upset, as usual. My father too. he doesn't show it so much. It's hard to get over something like that. Robin would have been a junior, like Alex. This would've been her first prom. I guess that's'why it seems so much worse this year. She stops, turns and faces Nick. It's hard for him to meet her gaze.

Jude looks about as stoned as she can get. She spots Nick, waves.

WENDY: You're all. children. She storms out. Melanie looks at Kim and Kelly, shrugs, follows Wendy. A DOOR SLAMS in the locker Kim and Kelly look at each other, laugh, turn their faces back to the steaming water. Neither one hears the SOUND across the room, a HARSH RHYTHMIC HEAVY
KIM: Watch it. Kelly covers her breasts with her arms, presses against the wall, terrified. Suddenly there's an EXPLOSION of SOUND. Kim screams, jumps back, stares. There's a jagged hole in the cen- ter of the mirror, huge cracks radiating from it, spidering across its surface. For a moment no one moves. Splinters of GLASS TRICKLE down to the floor. There's no other sound. Kim grabs for her towel, steps out of the shower, looks. There's no one. She heads for the locker room door. Kelly runs after her.
KELLY: KIM 1
KIM 1: 72 INT. LOCKER ROOM 72 Kim rushes into the room, Kelly right behind her. There's no one. Kelly is quivering. She clutches at Kim's arm. Kim looks at her.
KIM: What did you see? Kelly just shakes her head.
KELLY: Just. just. a shadow or.,. Kim heads for the exit door across the room. Kelly stays with her.

ALEX: My sister?
ALEX: Kiss the king?
NICK: On the mouth! Kim laughs at Alex's discomfort.
STUDENT: I'll find them, Miss Benton. Henri-Anne turns back to Nick and Kim.
KIM: Adele twists her head around to look at Kim. Her "Rainbow" collapses. Spinning around, Adele sits cross-legged on the floor and smiles at Kim.
ADELE: You okay?
KIM: Yeah. I've calmed down a bit.
ADELE: This works for me.
KIM: Has my father been back?

KIM: Oblivious, Hammond buries the axe in the stump. Kim moves around to face him. When he sees her, Hammond jumps, startled.
HAMMOND: I didn't hear you.
KIM: ( SMILES )

HA",24OND: She's had a bad day, Kim. I'm not sure she can handle it. See if you can talk to her. Hammond picks up the axe and sends it crashing into the 89 INT. KITCHEN - DUSK 89 Kim enters from the backyard. Looking around, she no- tices that nothing is being prepared for dinner. Curious, she moves toward the living room.
KIM: Hi, Mom.
VIVIAN: ( WITHOUT TURNING AROUND )
AROUND ): Hello, Robin. Don't eat anything. Dinner's almost ready. Disturbed, Kim frowns and slowly crosses the room to her mother.
KIM: Nothing's cooking, Mom. You must've forgotten. Slipping out of her reverie, Vivian turns around to face Kim.

HAMMOND: Vi. there's no time.
VIVIAN: I'm not going to look ridiculous!
IAMMOND: You don't look ridiculous, you look fine.
HAMMON D: Vi.. this is a big night for the school, it's a big night for me. I know how you're feeling. I understand. It's difficult for all of us. But we've got to make a special effort, Vi. We can't let the. terrible memories of this day affect us. That may seem cold and. insensitive to you, but it's the way it has to He pauses, staring down at his wife.

ALE: er's face is revealed. It is the nine-year-old Alex. Kim cradles the killer on the ground. She turns his head toward the light. We SEE his face full-on.
VIVIA N: She rushes forward, lunging for the body. Hammond grabs her, restraining her. Alex's dark eyes stare back unseeing at his family. His resemblance to his dead twin sister is uncanny. His hair falls onto his forehead in bangs, as Robin's had done seven years before. His makeup has been slop- pily applied. The rouged cheeks and the smudged red lips amplify the grotesque impersonation. Kim strokes her brother's hair. Hammond presses his hysterical wife to him. The onlookers slowly close in. We SLOWLY DISSOLVE FROM Alex's face TO a photograph of the Hammond family taken seven years earlier. We MOVE IN CLOSE ON the twins. Alex and Robin are smiling.
