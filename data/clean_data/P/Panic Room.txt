PANIC ROOM: David Koepp
LYDIA: seventeen feet wide, fifty-five feet deep, forty-two hundred square feet, four floors with a rentable basement apartment, so five altogether, courtyard in back
MEG: Could you slow down a little? Or we could wait for the car.
LYDIA: No cars. Feet are faster.
MEG: How many more do we have after this?
LYDIA: None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
MEG: This is it? I told you on the phone, I have to be moved in in two weeks. Sarah, please don't bounce that here.
SARAH: Mom, it's the sidewalk.
LYDIA: Oh, that miserable little prick is already leaving.
EVAN: One day you will learn to respect other people's time, Lydia, one day Evan, I am so sorry, you were a saint to wait for us!
LYDIA: Evan, I am so sorry, you were a saint to wait for us!
EVAN: This is the middle of the house, the entry floor, living room's over there. The kitchen floor's below us and there's two bedroom floors
EVAN: It's an enormous amount of space for the money and I'll be perfectly honest, the family is in no hurry
EVAN: I don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in Manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property.
LYDIA: No ball, kid.
EVAN: Working elevator. Mr. Pearlstine, the previous owner, was disabled the last ten years of his life. Highly unusual, the elevator, you will not find this in ninety percent of Will they take asking price? I need a two week escrow and I'm already approved for the loan.
MEG: Will they take asking price? I need a two week escrow and I'm already approved for the loan.
EVAN: What say we see the house before we dicker, hmm? I have to warn you, this is exactly the response we expected to get. It's a very emotional property.
LYDIA: Who taught you to negotiate?
SARAH: It's not like Saks', Mom, you don't have to pay the price on the tag.
MEG: I'm sorry. Apartments, and. money, and. this is more my husband's area.
MEG: Was. His area. I'm not very good
MEG: Things, and if I can't prove to my soon to-be ex-husband that I can provide a suitable place for our daughter to live in the next fourteen days, it's going to get ugly between us. Uglier.
EVAN: Top floor. Two bedrooms, one
EVAN: Third floor, spare bedroom, den, what have you. Mr. Pearlstine used it as an office.
LYDIA: ( low voice, to Meg ) He's talking about Bernard
EVAN: ( moving, through a Master bath.
LYDIA: The hotel guy? It's been in the papers lately. His kids are all suing each other over his estate. He was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it. Somebody took something didn't belong to them!
EVAN: I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
LYDIA: ( low, to Meg ) Stop calling it the property, you sound ridiculous.
EVAN: ( through a closet ) Master closet.
EVAN: Could the child please stop that?
LYDIA: KID! NO ELEVATOR!
EVAN: And we emerge in the master bedroom.
MEG: Something's weird.
LYDIA: I don't know, doesn't that corner seem funny to you?
MEG: I don't know, doesn't that corner seem funny to you?
EVAN: I was waiting to see if you'd notice! On caravan, no one from our office had the slightest idea.
EVAN: It's called a panic room.
MEG: A what?
EVAN: A safe room. An inner sanctum. A castle keep, in medieval times.
LYDIA: Oh, I've seen these.
EVAN: It's quite in vogue in high end construction right now. One really can't be too careful about home
LYDIA: Hey, this is perfect for you. Absolutely! You're a woman, you're living alone now. Your alarm goes off, or you head glass break, or for whatever reason you think someone's broken into your home in the middle of the night. What are you going to do? Call the police and wait until they get here on Tuesday? Traipse downstairs in your sexy little underthings and check it out? I think not!
EVAN: Reinforced steel core walls. Buried phone line, completely separate, not connected to the house's main line and never exposed throughout the house's infrastructure or outside the house you can call the police; nobody can cut you off. Your own ventilation system, complete with oxygen scrubber, so you've got plenty of fresh air for as long as you like. And a bank of video monitors
EVAN: covering almost every corner of the house.
MEG: Makes me nervous.
LYDIA: Ever read any Poe?
MEG: Ever read any Poe?
LYDIA: I don't think so, but I love her No, Edgar Allen.
MEG: No, Edgar Allen.
LYDIA: ( thinks ) The furniture guy?
MEG: ( giving up ) What's to keep them from prying open the door?
EVAN: Steel, four inches thick.
EVAN: Everything's spring-loaded, even if the power's out it's fully Open it.
MEG: Open it.
LYDIA: Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?
MEG: Open the door.
LYDIA: And with kids like he's got, no wonder he wanted a place to hide.
EVAN: That's highly inappropriate.
MEG: I said open the door.
SARAH: My room. Definitely my room.
LYDIA: That door is a safely hazard.
EVAN: Not at all.
EVAN: Infrared. Like the beam in an elevator doorway. Won't let the door close if something's blocking and one at shin height. Even bend down, blocks the one at
EVAN: He reaches up, to push the close button, but with one hand anchored at the floor, he can't quite reach it.
EVAN: ( to Lydia ) Push that button for me, will you?
MEG: Lydia pushes the close button, nothing happens. Evan pulls his hand put of the beam, takes a step back. Lydia pushes the button again.
SARAH: Too many stairs.
MEG: Got us in here, didn't I?
SARAH: Shoulda got an apartment.
MEG: Well, I know that now.
SARAH: Meg raises her hand to her face, she's got her cell phone in her palm.
MEG: Battery's dead.
MEG: The phone works. Hey, I hooked up the phone.
SARAH: ( sarcastic ) The crowd goes wild.
MEG: ( ignoring the slight )
SARAH: Meg finishes dialing. It rings, someone answers.
VOICE: Perry's Pizza, please hold.
SARAH: Fuck him.
MEG: Fuck her too.
SARAH: Fuck her too.
MEG: I agree. But don't.
SARAH: "Tom's throat felt so dry and tight that it was a moment before he could make any sound come out. "Dad!" He croaked. "I'm - inside - the - machine!" "Great Scott!" The elder scientist gasped. He dashed across the laboratory and switched off the repelatron's motor. "What happened, son?" "The Durafoam hardened, Dad. Get a solvent, quick you know the

MEG: Bypass non-ready zones. ah, shunt, enter, shunt again, zone number.

BURNHAM: A woman and a little girl, both asleep upstairs.
JUNIOR: Keep your voice down.
BURNHAM: Keep your voice down.
JUNIOR: They're not supposed to be here!
BURNHAM: This was your department, Junior.
JUNIOR: They're not supposed to be here!
BURNHAM: That's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
JUNIOR: Fourteen day escrow, man, that's almost three weeks! They shouldn't be here for another week! They don't own this house yet!
BURNHAM: ( pause ) Exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?
JUNIOR: Fourteen business days. Escrow is always business days.
JUNIOR: I mean, right? Isn't it?
BURNHAM: You're an idiot.
RAOUL: Watch your mouth.
JUNIOR: It's okay, Raoul.
BURNHAM: ( to Junior ) Who is this guy?
JUNIOR: Raoul is cool. That's all you need to know.
BURNHAM: This is insane. I'm outta here.
JUNIOR: Wait a minute, wait a minute. We can still handle this. Can we still handle this?
RAOUL: It's just the woman and the kid?
BURNHAM: Unless Daddy comes back later.
JUNIOR: Daddy's not coming back, she's in the middle of a divorce, it's just the two of them. We're okay, here. We can do this, right?
RAOUL: You're fuckin' A we can do this.
BURNHAM: Not with me. Not with people.
JUNIOR: Forty-five minutes. That's all you said you need. That's like nothing.
BURNHAM: She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
JUNIOR: So we keep an eye on her. Raoul can totally administrate that part.
RAOUL: No problem.
BURNHAM: I don't want Raoul to administrate that part.
JUNIOR: They won't get hurt.
BURNHAM: What about us? What if she has a Raoul, what in God's name do we do if she has a gun?
JUNIOR: Raoul, what in God's name do we do if she has a gun?
BURNHAM: A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you insult him? Hey, who's the idiot? Huh?
JUNIOR: A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you insult him? Hey, who's the idiot? Huh?
BURNHAM: Where did you get this clown?
JUNIOR: I met him at the tables, same as you. And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about What tables? I've never seen him Different tables.
BURNHAM: What tables? I've never seen him Different tables.
JUNIOR: Different tables.
BURNHAM: ( to Raoul ) The fuck did you bring a gun for?
RAOUL: You're welcome.
BURNHAM: Peace out.
JUNIOR: We can't do it without you, Burnham.
JUNIOR: It's still a good plan. It's just. got a twist.
BURNHAM: Yeah. Kidnapping.
JUNIOR: Not if we keep 'em here. You can't kidnap somebody in their own house. It's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace. Or something like that, I'm pretty Pure idiot.
BURNHAM: Pure idiot.
JUNIOR: I am. I'm an idiot's son. An idiot's grandson. I'm third- generation idiot. But for once in my life I had a good idea, and I'm not giving up so easy. You are? Are you actually telling me that for the first time in your life you're gonna throw your cards on the table and go home early? I can't believe my eyes. Fourteen million dollars upstairs, Burnham. You'll be out of the hole. Baby, you'll be so far out of the hole you could draw bricks every night for the next twenty years and still shit green. Come on, Buddy. One more hand.
RAOUL: ( whispers ) No face.
JUNIOR: Top floor, get the little girl and keep her there. I'll bring the woman up. Gimme.
JUNIOR: ( points to Burnham ) Stay here. Nobody gets past you.
MEG: Wake up. wake up.

RAOUL: IN THE ELEVATOR! BOTH OF 'EM HEADED TOWARD YOU!
TOWARD YOU!: INT. THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT Junior turns from the open doorway of the master bedroom and races back down the hall, toward the elevator. He reaches the door, peers through the window.
MEG: He's going down.
SARAH: That room!
MEG: PANIC ROOM!
SARAH: PANIC ROOM!
PANIC ROOM!: Meg thinks, then punches the button for three, to go back up.
SARAH: No. you gotta.
JUNIOR: SHE'S COMING BACK UP TOWARD YOU!!
MEG: Damn it!
SARAH: It doesn't work?!

MEG: Feel okay?
SARAH: Huh uh.
MEG: Huh uh.
SARAH: Huh uh.
MEG: Huh uh.
SARAH: Huh uh.
SARAH: Don't worry about me.
MEG: Sarah joins her, looks at the buttons. Each one is labeled with a different room name den, kitchen, master bedroom, etc. Up in the corner there is a button that says "ALL PAGE," down in the opposite corner there's a button marked
"TALK.": Meg looks at Sarah.
SARAH: Go ahead.
SARAH: You can do it.
MEG: I suggest you leave.
MEG: How'd he know that?
MEG: ( into speaker ) Take what you want and get out.
MEG: "What we want is in that room."
SARAH: They're coming in here, aren't they?
MEG: No, I told you, they can't. It's not a possibility.

MEG: ( into speaker ) "Get the fuck out of my house."
SARAH: "Get the fuck out of my house."
MEG: ( into speaker ) Get the fuck out of my house!
SARAH: Meg follows Sarah's eyes back to the screen, where another message is being held up for them.
MEG: Oh, please.
SARAH: Give me a break.
BURNHAM: Got her right where you want her, Shut up.
JUNIOR: Shut up.
BURNHAM: When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.
JUNIOR: Shut up and let me think.
BURNHAM: I'm afraid to let you think, Junior. Things get worse when you think. Oh, that's gonna help.
JUNIOR: ( holding in a hit ) Okay, fuckball, you think. What are we gonna do?
RAOUL: What if she called the cops?
BURNHAM: She didn't.
JUNIOR: She said she did.
BURNHAM: She lied. Cops woulda been here by now if she called 'em. Besides, Junior cut the phones.
RAOUL: What the fuck is funny about this?
BURNHAM: There is not one thing funny here.
RAOUL: There is not one thing funny here.
BURNHAM: Who else but God could think this shit up? I spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now I gotta figure out how to get in. God, man, He just loves the Yes. Yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing. You fuck. Now how are you gonna get us into that room?
JUNIOR: Yes. Yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing. You fuck. Now how are you gonna get us into that room?
BURNHAM: Can't. Whole point. Can't get in the room.
RAOUL: So what the fuck are we supposed to Make her come out. And when she does, that's when we gotta be careful. She can't get out of this house. She can't even think she can get out of this house. We just keep them here and keep them quiet for forty-five minutes. And I don't Joe Pesci here standing over them with his fat sweaty finger on the trigger. That's a sure way for us to end up with two dead bodies and little puffs of smoke burning out of our heads up in Greenhaven. So we're gonna seal the place up. They wanna hole up in here? Fine, we'll help 'em. Make it impossible for them to leave. Once they come out of that room.
BURNHAM: Make her come out. And when she does, that's when we gotta be careful. She can't get out of this house. She can't even think she can get out of this house. We just keep them here and keep them quiet for forty-five minutes. And I don't Joe Pesci here standing over them with his fat sweaty finger on the trigger. That's a sure way for us to end up with two dead bodies and little puffs of smoke burning out of our heads up in Greenhaven. So we're gonna seal the place up. They wanna hole up in here? Fine, we'll help 'em. Make it impossible for them to leave. Once they come out of that room.
JUNIOR: And why exactly would they want to come out?
BURNHAM: Workin' on it.
MEG: Hey. Relax, okay?
MEG: I mean it, lie down. You get your adrenaline up and you know what's gonna happen.
SARAH: Are you freaking out?
MEG: Little bit. Yeah.
SARAH: Small space?
MEG: ( nods, fast ) Don't though. ( talk about it, that is )
SARAH: Why did the chicken cross the road?
MEG: What am I, a five year old?
SARAH: Why did the chicken cross the road?
MEG: I don't know, why?
SARAH: To prove he wasn't chicken.
MEG: What the hell are they doing?
MEG: ( barely audible ) . locking us in.
SARAH: But Sarah's voice is hollow, seems far away.
SARAH: Are you okay?
SARAH: ( barely heard )
MEG: Not here. not here. someplace else. someplace else.
BAM!: Now the perfect spring day is shattered suddenly by a deafening CRUNCH. The smile vanishes from Meg's face, she turns. Where did that come from?
SARAH: THEY'RE COMING IN! THEY'RE COMING
IN!: Meg looks to the wall, watches it seem to vibrate as another deafening BANG crunches into it from outside.
SARAH: YOU CAN'T DO THAT! YOU CAN'T FREAK OUT LIKE THAT! YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE WITH ME! I am. I'm here.
MEG: I am. I'm here.
SARAH: YOU HAVE TO! I'm here. I'm here.
MEG: I'm here. I'm here.
MEG: We're fine. We're okay.
BAM!: In the master bedroom, a claw hammer CRUNCHES into the sheetrock on the outer wall of the panic room.
PROPANE: CAUTION - FLAMMABLE Along with a number of other dire warnings.
JUNIOR: Open it.
BURNHAM: I did.
RAOUL: He said open it.
BURNHAM: Just sending a message. She'll get the point.
RAOUL: We ain't playin', here.
SARAH: What, what, what is it?!
MEG: On the floor! Get on the floor!
BURNHAM: Look, don't be stupid.
JUNIOR: Be quiet.
BURNHAM: We're trying to scare them, not kill They're coughing.
JUNIOR: They're coughing.
BURNHAM: They're gonna die in there!
JUNIOR: Nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea? Think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?! Huh? We're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes, forty-five fucking minutes! The worst that's gonna happen is they pass out, we drag 'em out here into the fresh air, and they'll be fine.
BURNHAM: Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are we supposed to get into the room if they pass out?
JUNIOR: Cut it back a little bit.
RAOUL: No fucking way.
JUNIOR: He's right, we can't get into the room if they're dead!
BURNHAM: He tears himself away from the wall
BURNHAM: I'M COMING IN THERE, BITCH, I AM COMING IN THERE! I AM COMING IN
THERE!: INT. PANIC ROOM - NIGHT Meg whirls, goes to the door herself, SCREAMS right back. We can hardly make out a word she's saying, but it sounds Suddenly, she stops, hearing something else. Outside the door, Burnham continues to rant, but there's a second sound, a sound coming from the long wall of the panic room, the wall that's shared with the brownstone next door.
SARAH: Meg and Sarah leap as one, facing the common wall, SHOUTING at the tops of their lungs get help, call the police, please, call the police, that sort of thing.
RAOUL: ( to Junior ) We're gonna talk. Downstairs.
RAOUL: You stay. Make sure she don't come
MEG: Morse code?
SARAH: ( nods ) Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
MEG: Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
SARAH: THROUGH THE TUBE, the flashes continue dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot. But the Man continues to sleep, the light on the wall behind him has no effect.
MEG: Got him!
SARAH: Come on, come on.
MEG: Yes, yes, yes, yes.
SARAH: We're never getting out of here.
MEG: She looks at the wristwatch again.
JUNIOR: We're not gonna do anything about him, he's fine.
RAOUL: If you think I'm gonna let my half of the fourteen million bucks slip away because of
JUNIOR: "Half?" What did you, take a nap in math class? Three people, three shares, one third. Four point six six six repeating.
RAOUL: I'm just saying, the man is a problem. And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
JUNIOR: That's right, Raoul, it wasn't your idea, none of this was your idea, it was mine, it's my family we're ripping off, it's my prick grandfather who built that fucking room, it was my idea to get the plans, I found the floor safe, and it was my idea to ask a guy who builds these rooms to help break into one! Me, me, me, I, I, I, at no point did I say "you" or Raoul," got it?
RAOUL: He puts his hands on me again I'll bury a slug in his ear.
JUNIOR: No, you will not, because without Burnham there's no way in hell we're gonna get into that safe, so as far as I'm concerned he can paint your ass blue and run it up a flagpole and you won't lay a finger on him, you understand me?
RAOUL: Don't take no tone of voice with me, What is this shit you're talking all of a sudden? You're a bus driver, "Homes," you live in Flatbush, so please don't start spouting some Elmore Leonard shit you just heard because I saw that movie too,
JUNIOR: What is this shit you're talking all of a sudden? You're a bus driver, "Homes," you live in Flatbush, so please don't start spouting some Elmore Leonard shit you just heard because I saw that movie too,
MEG: She turns away from the monitors, to check on Sarah, who's settled into a corner of the room, looking pale.
MEG: Oh yes, yes.
MEG: . the hell is he?
SARAH: Do it.
MEG: Yeah, but where's the third guy?
SARAH: Not in the bedroom. Do it!
MEG: If it looks like I can't get back, just close the door.
SARAH: Close it!
MEG: Close it!
SARAH: Meg freezes. She looks at the monitor, wide-eyed. Close IN THE HALLWAY, Burnham can't take it anymore.
WAIT!: Meg freezes. She looks at the monitor, wide-eyed. Close IN THE HALLWAY, Burnham can't take it anymore.
BURNHAM: Oh, hell.
SARAH: GO GO GO!
BURNHAM: What'd she get, what'd she get, what'd she get.
BURNHAM: Cell phone.
JUNIOR: INT. PANIC ROOM - NIGHT Meg raises the cell phone to her ear

SARAH: Huh uh.
MEG: Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
SARAH: What if I keep dropping?
MEG: Not an option.
SARAH: What if I do?

SARAH: ( pause ) I'm sorry, Mom.
MEG: Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack.
SARAH: She lays back, oddly passive, her lips changing color. She stares at the monitors.
BURNHAM: Would you wait? Would you please just wait a minute?
BURNHAM: You walk out that door and you lose your share of the money.
JUNIOR: Yeah, whatever.

RAOUL: I have the gun.
BURNHAM: Remember that.
RAOUL: Remember that.
BURNHAM: Raoul pulls the gun back, just an inch. The skin around Burnham's eye is an angry red. His eyes dart, strain to look over at Harris, MOANING on the floor. And at Junior, dead.
BURNHAM: What? What do you want me to do?
RAOUL: What do you think? Get us into that I can't.
BURNHAM: I can't.

BURNHAM: Or I can't stop what he's gonna do. Do you understand?
BURNHAM: Burnham stands up, turns to the video camera, and SHOUTS.
BURNHAM: OPEN THE GOD DAMN DOOR!
BURNHAM: OPEN UP!
OPEN UP!: ON THE MONITORS, they see Burnham, standing over Harris; they faintly hear him call to them to open the door.
DADDY!: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT Harris is SHOUTING against the closed door.
HARRIS: DON'T DO IT! NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, DON'T OPEN THE DOOR! DON'T O
DON'T O: He's silenced by a vicious kick to the ribs. Raoul begins to beat him.
BURNHAM: STOP IT, MAN, STOP IT, THAT'S HIS KID IN THERE, HIS KID IS WATCHING
THIS!!: But Raoul whips the gun up, into Burnham's throat, backing him off, shutting him up.
MEG: Oh God, oh my God.
SARAH: You gotta jab me, Mommy.
MEG: Oh. oh.
BURNHAM: ( into speaker ) I just. I just need forty-five
RAOUL: Saw my face, man. Saw my face.
RAOUL: Shut up.
MEG: ( shouting into the camera ) cine, she needs the MEDICINE!
BURNHAM: It's gonna be cool, kid. Be outta here before you know it.
BURNHAM: Are you okay?
RAOUL: Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
BURNHAM: The hell does she want?
RAOUL: I don't know, she keeps screamin' the same thing over and over.
RAOUL: Drugs. She wants drugs. What the
BURNHAM: Oh, man.
BURNHAM: What is it?
SARAH: I need.
BURNHAM: . 'jection.
SARAH: . 'jection.
BURNHAM: An injection?
BURNHAM: That stuff?
BURNHAM: Can you do it yourself?
BURNHAM: Well, I don't know how.
RAOUL: I don't fucking believe this. You gotta wait.
BURNHAM: Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a little more, and your mom'll give it to you. You can wait a half hour, can't you?
RAOUL: Yeah. She can. She's fine, she's just like, tired, she's gotta rest. You rest, Kid. Half an hour.
RAOUL: Come on.
BURNHAM: Tell me the truth, okay? What's gonna happen if you don't get this?
SARAH: Coma. Die.
RAOUL: You're wasting your fucking time, man, you're wasting my time. You don't know how to do this, and the longer we stay in here, the more likely she's gonna lose it and call the cops!
BURNHAM: Are you gonna open the safe?
BURNHAM: Then shut up and get out of my way.
RAOUL: Don't look at me.
BURNHAM: Okay, kid, all I know about this is what I've seen on TV, you gotta talk me through it.
BURNHAM: Okay. No talking. No problem. TV don't lie, right?
BURNHAM: You seem like a good kid. Your mom. only saw her for a second, but, woah. Beautiful, huh?
BURNHAM: Hey, nod or something, show me you're still alive, will ya?
BURNHAM: Attagirl. That too tight?
BURNHAM: You guys are pretty rich, huh?
BURNHAM: Yeah, you don't think about that stuff. Good for you.
BURNHAM: I know, I know. I really screwed the pooch this time. I never did anything like this before. Break into somebody's house? Not even close. Bad cards, Kid. I swear to God, I been on the wrong end of maybe six straight years of bad cards. House. Car. Wife. Those are some seriously bad cards. And still, every time I pick up a fresh hand I swear to God, the rush comes so hot and prickly I feel it right down to my toes because this time, this one time, it might be there, this time it might be that hand, that perfect hand, that monster hand. And you thought you were sick.
BURNHAM: Feel better?
BURNHAM: Woulda been a hell of a dad.
RAOUL: Congratulations. You saved her life for ten minutes.
HARRIS: ( gasps ) You called the police?
MEG: ( gasps ) You called the police?
HARRIS: You. scared.
MEG: Don't. Say. A word.
RAOUL: Holy shit. holy shit.
RAOUL: She's fuckin' crazy, she killed the kid! She just killed her own kid!
BURNHAM: It's not her fault, it's not her fault, the guy must have called them. Look, look, look, she's telling us.
BURNHAM: She's gonna handle it.
RAOUL: She better.
MEG: COP 1
COP 1: Everything okay?
MEG: COP 2
COP 2: Are you all right?
MEG: What are you guys what time is 'Bout four o'clock.
COP 1: 'Bout four o'clock.
MEG: I don't get it.
COP 2: We got a call.
MEG: Somebody called you?
COP 1: Can we come in?
MEG: What do you want?
COP 1: We'd like to come in.
MEG: No, you can't come in.
COP 2: Are you okay?
MEG: I'm fine.
COP 1: Can we come in?
MEG: Stop asking me that. I'm fine. Who called you?
COP 1: You don't look so good.
MEG: You wake me out of a sound sleep at four in the morning and then tell me I look like hell? Of course I look like hell, you don't look so hot yourself, Jack. I'm freezing here, thank you for checking, can I go?
COP 1: Your husband says you said "There are three." right before you got cut off.
MEG: Oh, that phone call.
COP 1: Ma'am, if there's something you want to say to us right now that maybe you can't say to us right now, maybe you just want to make a signal, by blinking a few times, something like
COP 1: That's something you could do.
MEG: Man, you are good! You mean, like, if somebody was in the house or something? That's great, they really train you guys these days, don't they?
MEG: No. I'm fine. Cross my heart.
COP 1: May I ask what the rest of that sentence was going to be?
MEG: ( stalling ) The sentence that started "There are three." What was the rest?
COP 1: The sentence that started "There are three." What was the rest?
MEG: Okay, look. My husband and I just broke up. It's my first night in the new house, and I was feeling a little lonely and a little drunk. The sentence, if you insist on knowing, was going to be "There are three things I'll do for you if you come over right now and get in bed with me."
MEG: But thank God I came to my senses before I said all that and hung up instead, so nobody would ever know what I was thinking, unless, of course, two policemen showed up in the middle of the night to interrogate me about it.
COP 2: You want her to show you which three things, Rick, or should we just go?
RAOUL: She saw my face. The kid too.
BURNHAM: That's your problem.
RAOUL: That's their problem.
BURNHAM: Let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.
RAOUL: You finish. Then we finish.
BURNHAM: You know how this gotta end.
RAOUL: You know how this gotta end.
MEG: She hurries out of the bedroom. What's she doing?
MEG: No camera, no camera, no camera.
RAOUL: He turns, away from the monitors.
SARAH: Sorry. Can't control it sometimes.
SARAH: ( to Raoul ) Won't happen again.
NEIGHBOR: What the hell do you think you're doing, young lady?!
RAOUL: The walls are steel, right?
BURNHAM: Not that one.
RAOUL: NOT THAT ONE?! Hey man, it's the neighbor's house, who breaks in through the neighbor's
BURNHAM: Hey man, it's the neighbor's house, who breaks in through the neighbor's
BURNHAM: WHO THE FUCK BREAKS IN THROUGH THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?! We've got the Kid! WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!! What the fuck is she thinking?!
NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?!: We've got the Kid! WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!! What the fuck is she thinking?!
RAOUL: We've got the Kid! WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!! What the fuck is she thinking?!
BURNHAM: She's got your gun, that's what she's thinking! The FUCK you had to bring a gun for?!
BURNHAM: Almost there.
BURNHAM: ALMOST THERE.
CRUNCH!: The sledgehammer head strikes again, opening up a hole about a foot across. Light spills through from the other side, as well as the voice of the hysterical Neighbor.
BANG!: A gunshot whizzes right through one of the bonds, setting it aflame before it SLAMS into the far wall, sending up a little cloud of plaster dust.
BURNHAM: He whirls, sees an arm poking through the hole in the wall, gun extended.
JESUS!: He whirls, sees an arm poking through the hole in the wall, gun extended.
BURNHAM: I GOT THE MONEY, LET'S GO!!!
BURNHAM: GO, LET'S GO, OUTTA HERE!!
RAOUL: YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO! FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!
BURNHAM: FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!
COP 1: Put your hands up.
BURNHAM: Monster hand.
SARAH: I mean, uptown is close to Dad's place, but somebody at school said the Village is really cool, so. I don't know, it's so great to be close to the park and everything. What do you think, I mean, give me a clue, here, where are we gonna live?
