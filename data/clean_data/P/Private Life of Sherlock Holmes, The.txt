WATSON'S VOICE: Somewhere in the vaults of a bank in London is a tin dispatch box with my name on it. It is not to be opened until fifty years after my death.
WATSON'S VOICE: It contains certain mementos of my long association with a man who elevated the science of deduction to an art the world's first, and undoubtedly most famous, consulting detective.
WATSON'S VOICE: It was August of 1887, and we were returning from Yorkshire, where Holmes had solved the baffling murder of Colonel
WATSON'S VOICE: You may recall that he broke the murderer's alibi by measuring the depth to which the parsley had sunk in the butter on a hot day.
WATSON'S VOICE: He was the most brilliant man I have ever known and I dare say people have envied me for sharing that flat with him in Baker Street.
WATSON'S VOICE: I'll grant you he was stimulating but he could also be moody, unpredictable, egocentric, and more often than not, completely infuriating as our landlady, Mrs. Hudson, can attest bless her kind soul.
MRS. HUDSON: I do wish you'd give me a little more warning when you come home unexpected. I would have roasted a goose and had some flowers for you.
HOLMES: My dear Mrs. Hudson criminals are as unpredictable as head-colds. You never quite know when you're going to catch
MRS. HUDSON: I'll unpack your bags.
WATSON: Here's an advance copy of Strand They've printed 'The Red-Headed League!'
HOLMES: ( offhand ) Very impressive.
WATSON: ( leafing through the Would you like to see how I treated it?
HOLMES: out all sorts of fascinating things about the case that I never knew before.
WATSON: you have a tendency to over-romanticize. You have taken my simple exercises in logic and embellished them, exaggerated whereas I am barely six-foot-one.

HOLMES: virtuoso. Here

HOLMES: own in the pit orchestra of a second-rate music hall.
WATSON: ( busy with the mail ) You have given the reader the distinct impression that I am a misogynist. Actually, I don't dislike women I merely distrust them. The twinkle in the eye and the arsenic in the soup.
HOLMES: ( busy with the mail ) You have given the reader the distinct impression that I am a misogynist. Actually, I don't dislike women I merely distrust them. The twinkle in the eye and the arsenic in the soup.
WATSON: me as a hopeless dope addict just because I occasionally take a five per cent solution of cocaine.
HOLMES: me as a hopeless dope addict just because I occasionally take a five per cent solution of cocaine.
WATSON: you've been diluting it behind my back?
HOLMES: you've been diluting it behind my back?
WATSON: strongly disapprove of this insidious habit of yours.
HOLMES: My dear friend as well as my dear doctor I only resort to narcotics when I am suffering from acute boredom when there are no interesting cases to engage my mind. Look at this an urgent appeal to find six missing midgets.
WATSON: Did you say midgets?
HOLMES: Six of them the Tumbling Piccolos an acrobatic act with some circus.
WATSON: Disappeared between London and Bristol . Don't you find that intriguing?
HOLMES: Extremely so. You see, they are not only midgets but also anarchists.
WATSON: ( nodding ) By now they have been smuggled to Vienna, dressed as little girls in burgundy pinafores. They are to greet the Czar of all the Russias when he arrives at the railway station. They will be carrying bouquets of flowers, concealed in each bouquet will be a bomb with a lit fuse.

WATSON: You really think so?
HOLMES: Not at all. The circus owner offers me five pounds for my services that's not even a pound a midget.
WATSON: ( crestfallen ) Oh. And it sounded so promising
HOLMES: There are no great crimes anymore, Watson. The criminal class has lost all enterprise and originality. At best they commit some bungling villainy, with a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard official can see through
HOLMES: ( angrily ) Mrs. Hudson! ( even angrier )
MRS. HUDSON!: Mrs. Hudson comes hurrying out of the bedroom.
MRS. HUDSON: Yes? What is it? What have I done now?
HOLMES: ( sternly ) There is something missing from my desk.
MRS. HUDSON: Something very crucial. You have been tidying up against my explicit orders.
HOLMES: Something very crucial. You have been tidying up against my explicit orders.
MRS. HUDSON: Oh, I made sure not to disturb anything.
HOLMES: Dust, Mrs. Hudson, is an essential part of my filing system. By the thickness of it, I can date any document immediately.
MRS. HUDSON: Some of the dust was this thick.
HOLMES: ( promptly ) That would be March, 1883.
MRS. HUDSON: How can you stand this? Why don't you let me air the room out?
WATSON: Please, Mrs. Hudson he's working on a definitive study of tobacco ash.
MRS. HUDSON: ( drily ) I'm sure there's a crying need for that.
WATSON: In our endeavors, it is sometimes vital to distinguish between, say, the ashes of a Macedonian cigarette and a Jamaican cigar. Sor far he has classified 140 different kinds of ashes.
MRS. HUDSON: All of which will end up on my rug. That'll be enough, Mrs. Hudson.
WATSON: That'll be enough, Mrs. Hudson.
MRS. HUDSON: ( heading for door ) All right. If you gentlemen want to stay here and suffocate. She's right. I am suffocating.
HOLMES: She's right. I am suffocating.
WATSON: Let me open a window.
HOLMES: Not from lack of air from lack of activity. Sitting here week after week blowing smoke rings staring through a microscope there's no challenge in Personally, I consider it a major contribution to scientific criminology. How I envy you your mind, Watson.
WATSON: Personally, I consider it a major contribution to scientific criminology. How I envy you your mind, Watson.
HOLMES: How I envy you your mind, Watson.
WATSON: You do?
HOLMES: It's placid, imperturbable, prosaic. But my mind rebels against stagnation. It's like a racing engine, tearing itself to pieces because it's not connected up with the work for which it was built.
WATSON: Holmes pays no attention, continues into the bedroom. Watson crosses to the open door. Inside the bedroom, Holmes has put down the cocaine bottle on the washstand, and is rolling up his left sleeve.
WATSON: Holmes, where is your self-control?
HOLMES: Fair question.
WATSON: Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
HOLMES: Thoroughly. But this will take care of
WATSON'S VOICE: Naturally, I don't mean to imply that my friend was always on cocaine sometimes it was opium, sometimes it was hashish. And once he went one of these dreadful binges, there was no telling how long it would last.
WATSON: The only reason you moved in with me is to have a steady supply of stimulants.
HOLMES: Now, now, Watson you mustn't underestimate your other charms.
WATSON: Holmes, I warn you. If you lock yourself in there once more
HOLMES: I intend to do nothing of the sort.
HOLMES: Not until you replace this needle. It is getting rather blunt.
MRS. HUDSON: I made you some tea and cress sandwiches.
WATSON: Mrs. Hudson, I want you to pack my bags.
MRS. HUDSON: Are you going away for the weekend?
WATSON: And beyond. I'm moving out.
MRS. HUDSON: Moving out?
HOLMES: I'm just as surprised as you are.
WATSON: You heard me, Mrs. Hudson. And let's not waste any time.
HOLMES: May I be so bold as to ask where you'er I don't know yet. But I intend to resume my practice. I am, after all, a doctor. And quite a competent one, if I say so as You'll find it very dull snipping out tonsils and flushing out kidneys If you're looking for your medical bag, you hid it under the Moorish table. Which shows a little more imagination than last time when it was under your

WATSON: I will, of course, continue to pay my half of the rent until you find someone to share these rooms with you.
HOLMES: Where am I going to find anyone who will put up with my rather eccentric habits?
WATSON: ( taking hypodermic needle out Here's a fresh needle and here's my farewell present to you. If you want to destroy yourself, go right ahead. But I won't sit by and watch you doing it.
WATSON: If you want to destroy yourself, go right ahead. But I won't sit by and watch you doing it.
HOLMES: Watson disappears into the bedroom, slamming the door. Holmes looks after him, then looks at the bottles of dope on the mantelpiece. He starts pacing. After a moment he stops at the chemistry table, studies the assorted glassware on the shelves above.
MRS. HUDSON: It's so sad. You and Mr. Holmes after all these years
WATSON: Please, Mrs. Hudson none of that.
MRS. HUDSON: I'll wash this and send it on to you.
WATSON: I'll be at Brown's Hotel.
MRS. HUDSON: ( still sniffling ) I know how it feels I once went through a divorce myself.
WATSON: ( removing diploma from wall ) Actually, I'm rather looking forward to it. Leading a normal life again. Regular office hours nine to three and if occasionally there's an emergency call in the middle of the night, I know it's going be appendicitis and not an ax murder. Let Holmes go mucking about in the fog and the sleet, looking for a bloodstained collar-button out on the moors, with some demented hound snapping at his behind
MRS. HUDSON: Mr. Holmes.
HOLMES: Please, Mrs. Hudson. You're in my line of fire.
MRS. HUDSON: ( outraged ) How many times have I told you I will not tolerate pistol practice on my premises? I should have evicted you when you shot them holes in my wall.
HOLMES: Merely celebrating Her Majesty's Golden Look at that mess you made It's all right, Mrs. Hudson. I'll clean it up while you unpack my things.
MRS. HUDSON: Look at that mess you made It's all right, Mrs. Hudson. I'll clean it up while you unpack my things.
WATSON: It's all right, Mrs. Hudson. I'll clean it up while you unpack my things.
MRS. HUDSON: You heard him.
HOLMES: You heard him.
WATSON: Thank you, Holmes. I know how difficult it must've been for you
HOLMES: Not really. It was simple choice between a bad habit and a good companion.
WATSON: You've made me very happy.
HOLMES: I've often been accused of being cold and unemotional. I admit to it. And yet, in my cold, unemotional way, I'm very fond of you, Watson.
WATSON: I know that. But one likes to hear these things occasionally.
WATSON: Look at this. Covered with that nasty stuff. I'd better dry it off.
HOLMES: I'll do it.
WATSON: For a moment, I was worried that you were going to let me walk out that you weren't even going to try to stop me.
HOLMES: Now, Watson you know there's nothing I wouldn't do to keep you here.
WATSON'S VOICE: It was not the first not the last time he tricked me like that. Normally, I was inclined to forgive him.
WATSON'S VOICE: But on one occasion, he did something that was so utterly unforgivable, that I would gladly have murdered him had it not been for my saintly disposition.
WATSON: Why are you being so stubborn, Holmes? Why won't you go? It's the final performance of the Imperial Russian Ballet the house has been sold out for
WATSON: seats are going for a guinea apiece
HOLMES: That's precisely it. Why should someone send up two free tickets? Anonymously, at that.
WATSON: Whoever sent them must be in great distress. The note says
HOLMES: I suspect it's some sort of plot.
WATSON: You mean somebody wants to lure us into a Somebody wants to kill me.
HOLMES: Somebody wants to kill me.
WATSON: Kill you?
HOLMES: That's right. It's a plot to bore me to death. I detest ballet.
WATSON: But this isn't just any ballet. It's Swan Lake.
WATSON: ( confidentially ) You know, of course, Holmes that swan isn't really a swan it's an enchanted ( bored )
HOLMES: ( bored )
BOX: Watson trains his opera glasses on the stage, Holmes stifles a yawn.
STAGE: PETROVA, as the Queen of the Swans, makes her entrance to loud applause. She is in her forties, but splendidly preserved, undoubtedly the greatest ballerina around.
BOX: Watson nudges Holmes, who has dozed off.
WATSON: Fabulous woman, don't you think so, The great Petrova.
HOLMES: ( coming to ) The great Petrova.
WATSON: The great Petrova.
STAGE: Petrova is making an exit, backwards, on points.
BOX: Holmes lowers the glasses, returns them to Watson.
HOLMES: Very strong arches, I must admit.
WATSON: They say twelve men have died for her.
HOLMES: Six committed suicide, four were killed in duels, and one fell out of the gallery in the Vienna Opera House.
WATSON: Six committed suicide, four were killed in duels, and one fell out of the gallery in the Vienna Opera House.
HOLMES: That's only eleven.
WATSON: The man who fell from the gallery landed on top of another man in the orchestra.
HOLMES: That makes an even dozen in a messy sort of way.
STAGE: Petrova and the dancer playing the Prince go into the famous pas-de-deux.
BOX: Watson enjoying himself immensely, Holmes sitting there dourly. The red plush curtain at the rear of the box parts, and a man in evening clothes and a top hat enters. He is in his middle fifties, extremely soigne, and somewhat sinister. His name is ROGOZHIN, and he is Russian. Holmes and Watson look around.
ROGOZHIN: Mister Holmes?
HOLMES: I am Nicolai Rogozhin, director-general of the Imperial Russian Ballet. So glad you accept invitation.
ROGOZHIN: I am Nicolai Rogozhin, director-general of the Imperial Russian Ballet. So glad you accept invitation.
HOLMES: This is Dr. Watson.
ROGOZHIN: Pleased to meet you. You are enjoying?
WATSON: ( abruptly ) Tell me, Mr. Holmes, how is your health?
ROGOZHIN: ( abruptly ) Tell me, Mr. Holmes, how is your health?
HOLMES: My health? Better consult my doctor.
WATSON: ( to Rogozhin ) Oh, he's in excellent shape.
ROGOZHIN: ( to Holmes ) Any insanity in your family? Diabetes? Would you mind telling me what this is all about?
HOLMES: Would you mind telling me what this is all about?
ROGOZHIN: Certainly. Madame Petrova, she has Could you be more specific?
HOLMES: Could you be more specific?
ROGOZHIN: Certainly not.
WATSON: A liason with a crowned head? Compromising letters? Blackmail?
STAGE: The pas-de-deux finished, to a rousing ovation.
BOX: Rogozhin rises, turns to Holmes.
ROGOZHIN: After performance, there will be little celebration backstage and Madame requests your presence.
WATSON: We'd be delighted.
ROGOZHIN: ( to Watson ) You are invited, also.
STAGE: The performance is over, the curtain is up, the party is on. Tables have been set up, with caviar, vodka and champagne. The members of the orchestra are now playing balalaikas, and crew and cast ( the ballerinas still in costume, the male dancers in tights ) seem in high Holmes and Watson, in silk hats with canes, appear from the wings, stop, survey the scene. Watson's eyes are shining with anticipation. In contrast, Holmes' face is sober and quizzical. Rogozhin spots the two, detaches himself from a group, hurries over to join them.
ROGOZHIN: There you are, Mr. Holmes. Madame is expecting you in her dressing room. Dr. Watson, you will amuse yourself meanwhile we have vodka, caviar, girls.
WATSON: No, thank you.
ROGOZHIN: No girls?
WATSON: No caviar. Makes me break out in hives.
ROGOZHIN: Dievushki. Siude, siuda, dievushki. Posnakomtes s docktorum Watsonom.
WATSON: Any of you girls understand English?
GIRLS: Not one single word?
WATSON: Not one single word?
GIRLS: In that case, I don't mind telling you that you all have lovely po-pos.
WATSON: In that case, I don't mind telling you that you all have lovely po-pos.
BACKSTAGE: Rogozhin is leading Holmes toward Madame Petrova's dressing room.
ROGOZHIN: Mr. Holmes, I must prepare you this is no ordinary case.
HOLMES: It is only the extraordinary that interests me.
ROGOZHIN: Good. Because you will find this extra-

PETROVA: ( to Holmes ) Vi menshe rostom chem ja ozhidala.
HOLMES: Madame says you are shorter than she I didn't mean to be.
HOLMES: I didn't mean to be.
PETROVA: No eto nie vazhno. Menia interessujut glavnim obra som vashi mosghi.
ROGOZHIN: Short, tall, who cares? It is the brains that count.

PETROVA: Nikolai, pokazhite iemu skripku.
ROGOZHIN: Mr. Holmes, you know about fiddles. What is your opinion of this?
HOLMES: ( reading ) 'Antonius Stradivarius Cremonesis, Anno 1709.' Well, the label is authentic. ( examines violin, plucks Judging from the shape, the color of the varnish, and the tone, I would say it is a genuine Stradivarius of the best You like?
ROGOZHIN: You like?
HOLMES: It's magnificent.

HOLMES: For services you will render.
ROGOZHIN: For services you will render.
HOLMES: My fees as a detective are not exactly trifling but a Stradivarius you're not serious.
ROGOZHIN: I am not. But Madame is.
PETROVA: Nalejte vodki i obiasnite jemu v chom
ROGOZHIN: ( starts pouring vodka; it is Mr. Holmes, what you have seen tonight is last and positively final performance of Madame Petrova. She is retiring.
HOLMES: years old. And after all, she is now I must say she doesn't look thirty-eight.
ROGOZHIN: years old. And after all, she is now I must say she doesn't look thirty-eight.
HOLMES: ( gallantly ) I must say she doesn't look thirty-eight.
ROGOZHIN: ( he hands her a glass of So Madame has decided to leave ballet and spend life bringing up her child.

HOLMES: ( puts down violin ) About my medical history when you asked me I neglected to mention a small detail. There is hemophilia in my family. We're all bleeders.
ROGOZHIN: ( to Petrova ) On govorit, chto v jevo semie stradajut
PETROVA: Madame says not to worry. She will not scratch you.
ROGOZHIN: Madame says not to worry. She will not scratch you.
HOLMES: That's reassuring to know. But

ROGOZHIN: Madame says you talk too much. You find her attractive or no?
WATSON: Excuse me. What does prokanzik mean?
ROGOZHIN: It means 'You little devil.'
WATSON: It does? I am? Thank you.
ROGOZHIN: ( to Holmes ) I repeat question. You find Madame attractive or no?
HOLMES: ( turning to Rogozhin ) Oh, I find her most attractive for a woman, that is.
ROGOZHIN: Then no problem.
HOLMES: free man.

HOLMES: ( imitating Rogozhin's accent ) It would have been catastrophe.
PETROVA: ( screaming ) Potchemu vi nie vijasnili eto eto ranshe, prezhde chem posoritj menia!
STAGE: The party has built into a real wingding by now. It's wild drinking, laughing, singing. Everybody is turned on especially Watson. He is dancing with a dozen of the ballerinas to madly accelerating balalaika music. Flower behind ear, hair mussed, tie undone, short of breath he is in paradise. Holmes makes his way through the revelers, approaches
HOLMES: ( Watson pays no attention ) Watson, are you coming?
WATSON: ( without missing a step ) What is it, old boy?
HOLMES: We're going home.
WATSON: Home? Not a chance. Not the slightest not the remotest chance. Toodle-ooo. Hold on! Just a moment!
WATSON: Hold on! Just a moment!
WATSON: ( bewildered ) What's going on? What happened to the Why? Do you not prefer it this way?
ROGOZHIN: Why? Do you not prefer it this way?
WATSON: What way?
ROGOZHIN: You don't have to pretend. Mr. Holmes told us everything about you and him
WATSON: About me and him?
ROGOZHIN: Come now, no need to be bashful. We are not bourgeois. Maybe with doctors and detectives is unusual but in ballet, is very usual.
WATSON: What is?
ROGOZHIN: Caprice of Mother Nature. Look at Pavel and Mischa and Boris and Dmitri
ROGOZHIN: And Ilya and Sergei Sergei half and half.
WATSON: He races up the stairs and across the landing, flings open the door of the flat.
WATSON: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Watson, grim and breathless, stands in the open doorway. Over the back of the wing chair, he sees smoke curling up from Holmes' pipe.
WATSON: There you are, you wretch! You rotter! You blackguard! Of all the vile, unspeakable fabrications. What do you have to say for yourself?
WATSON: Don't just sit there speak up, man!
WATSON: Holmes.? Are you all right, Holmes?
HOLMES: From the sound of your footsteps, I gathered that you were not in a particularly amiable mood.
WATSON: ( with renewed fury ) How could you do a dastardly thing like that to me? What the deuce were you thinking of?
HOLMES: Watson, you have my most abject apologies. But have you ever been cornered by a madwoman? It seemed like the only way to get out of it without hurting her feelings.
WATSON: What about my feelings? And my reputation? Do you realize the gravity of what you have done? The possible So there'll be a little gossip about you in St. Petersburg.
HOLMES: So there'll be a little gossip about you in St. Petersburg.
WATSON: These things spread like wildfire. I can just hear those malicious whispers behind my back. I'll never be able to show my face in polite society.
HOLMES: Watson, you're running amok.
WATSON: Dishonored, disgraced, ostracized. What am I to do?
HOLMES: Well, for one thing, I'd get rid of that
WATSON: You may think this is funny, but we're both in the same boat. We must take desperate measures. We must stop this Maybe if we got married.
HOLMES: Then they'd really talk.
WATSON: ( starts pacing ) Obviously, we cannot continue to live under the same roof. We must move apart.
HOLMES: Of course, we can still see each other clandestinely on remote benches in Hyde Park, and in the waiting rooms of suburban railway stations
WATSON: ( a change in attitude; The whole thing is ridiculous. We have nothing to hide.
HOLMES: That's what I've been trying to tell you.
WATSON: Let somebody start a rumor just one ugly word and we'll sue them for Nobody would dare. After all, you have an enviable record with the fair sex.
HOLMES: Nobody would dare. After all, you have an enviable record with the fair sex.
WATSON: Damn right. I can get women from three continents to testify for me. And you can get women to vouch for you, too can't you, Holmes? Can you, Holmes?
WATSON: Can you, Holmes?
HOLMES: Good night, Watson.
WATSON: Holmes, let me ask you a question I hope I'm not being presumptuous but there have been women in your life?
HOLMES: The answer is yes. You're being presumptuous. Good night.
WATSON: DISSOLVE TO:
WATSON'S VOICE: What, indeed, was his attitude toward women? Was there some secret he was holding back or was he just a thinking machine, incapable of any emotion?
WATSON'S VOICE: I was not to get the answer until we became involved in what I consider to be the most outrageous case in all our years
WATSON: Were you expecting someone?
HOLMES: Not at this hour.
WATSON: Maybe Mrs. Hudson is entertaining.
HOLMES: I never found her so.
WATSON: What is it, Mrs. Hudson?
MRS. HUDSON: ( looking up ) There's a cabbie here he says you owe him two-and-six.
WATSON: For what?
CABBIE: ( to Watson ) For the fare, guv'nor. The young lady doesn't have any money.
WATSON: What young lady?
CABBIE: This one.
WATSON: Well. What have we here? Who are you, miss? What happened to you?
GABRIELLE: ( slight accent ) I don't know.
CABBIE: That's all she keeps saying I don't know, I don't know.
WATSON: Where did she come from?
CABBIE: From the river. I was driving down the Embankment, just below Westminster Bridge, and there she was in the water
CABBIE: It wasn't easy, guv'nor what with the cold water and her fighting me
HOLMES: ( from the upper landing ) Why did you bring her here?
CABBIE: Because I found this in her hand 221B Baker Street that's right, isn't it?
HOLMES: ( to Gabrielle ) Young lady what did you want at this ( looking up, trying to focus ) I do not remember.
GABRIELLE: ( looking up, trying to focus ) I do not remember.
WATSON: ( to Holmes ) Rather perplexing, wouldn't you say?
HOLMES: Well, gentlemen, you want her? it's two-and-six or shall I throw her back in the river?
CABBIE: Well, gentlemen, you want her? it's two-and-six or shall I throw her back in the river?
MRS. HUDSON: Mr. Holmes. You can't let him
HOLMES: Watson, you'd better accept delivery.
WATSON: Keep the change.
CABBIE: Thank you, guv'nor.
CABBIE: No extra charge for the use of the horse-
WATSON: You're shivering, my dear.
WATSON: Sit here, my dear.
WATSON: She's suffering from shock and exposure.
HOLMES: There was some printing on the back of this but it seems to have come off in the water.
WATSON: Look at this she's had a nasty blow on the head.
HOLMES: Could she have hit her head when she fell or jumped into the river?
WATSON: No. The blood has already coagulated. So it would appear that she was the victim of a deliberate attack. Get my bag, will you?
GABRIELLE: Who are you?
WATSON: I'm Dr. Watson and this is Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Do the names mean anything to you?
GABRIELLE: I'm trying.
WATSON: I'm trying.
GABRIELLE: I'm trying.
HOLMES: Can you think of your own name?
GABRIELLE: ( a beat, then shakes her She's obviously had a concussion which often leads to temporary amnesia.
WATSON: She's obviously had a concussion which often leads to temporary amnesia.
HOLMES: So all we know is that she was coshed on the head, dumped into the Thames, and subsequently dumped into our laps.
WATSON: We know a lot more than that. From her accent, we know she is foreign from her ring, we know she is married and there is one other clue we have. Something I deduced while I was helping her up the stairs. No corset.
HOLMES: Good work.
HOLMES: ( to Gabrielle ) Are you French? ( in Berlitz French ) Vous etes Francaise?
GABRIELLE: ( concentrating then ) Non, je ne suis pas Francaise.
WATSON: How can she say she's not French, in Vous etes Suisse?
HOLMES: Vous etes Suisse?
GABRIELLE: Alors, vous etes Belge.
HOLMES: Alors, vous etes Belge.
GABRIELLE: ( haltingly ) Je suis pas sure. Vous etes Belge de Bruxelles!
HOLMES: Vous etes Belge de Bruxelles!
GABRIELLE: Bruxelles? Oui. Je pense que oui.
MRS. HUDSON: Oh, dash. Will someone remove the violin, please?
WATSON: We just found out that she's Belgian.
MRS. HUDSON: Poor thing.
WATSON: From Brussels.
HOLMES: ( taking Gabrielle's hand ) If you don't mind. Your name is Gabrielle, is that right? I don't know.
HOLMES: Your name is Gabrielle, is that right? I don't know.
GABRIELLE: I don't know.
HOLMES: And your husband's name is Emile?
GABRIELLE: ( vaguely ) Where is he? What are you doing in I don't know.
HOLMES: Where is he? What are you doing in I don't know.
GABRIELLE: I don't know.
HOLMES: When did you arrive from Brussels? Where are you staying?
GABRIELLE: I don't know.
HOLMES: What happened at the river? Think! Pensez! Concentrez vous!
WATSON: ( stepping forward ) That's enough, Holmes. I will not permit you to question her in this condition. ( helps the sobbing Gabrielle Mrs. Hudson, put her to bed. My bed. ( Mrs. Hudson gives him a I'll sleep on the couch.
MRS. HUDSON: Come, my dear.
WATSON: I'd better mix her a sleeping potion. Watson, I think we should arrange to have her removed to a hospital.
HOLMES: Watson, I think we should arrange to have her removed to a hospital.
WATSON: Under no circumstances.
HOLMES: She should have medical attention.
WATSON: She can get that from me. But more importantly, she must be protected there has already been one attempt on her This temporary amnesia how temporary is it?
HOLMES: This temporary amnesia how temporary is it?
WATSON: It depends on the extent of the injury. It's like veils shrouding her memory. It could clear up in a few days or a few Watson, this is a very small flat we don't want to clutter it up with women.
HOLMES: Watson, this is a very small flat we don't want to clutter it up with women.
WATSON: Holmes, we've never had a case like this. A woman comes to us with a problem we don't know who the woman is and we don't know what the problem is. Don't you find that challenging?
HOLMES: Quite. But we can't afford to wait for those veils to lift we must break through them as quickly as possible.
WATSON: You really feel it's that urgent?
HOLMES: I do. The sooner we solve the case, the sooner we can get rid of her.
WATSON: He picks up the cup of tea with the sedative in it, carries it toward the door of his bedroom.
GABRIELLE: She starts to get out of bed.
GABRIELLE: Holmes looks up as Gabrielle appears in the open doorway.
GABRIELLE: Emile? Is that you, Emile?
HOLMES: ( stepping into shadow ) Yes, Gabrielle.
GABRIELLE: ( hurrying toward him ) Ah, Emile. I thought I'd never find you. ( embracing him ) Hold me. Hold me tight. ( Holmes puts his arms around It's been such a long time. So many nights. You know what I did before I left Brussels?
HOLMES: I hope you won't be angry with me. I bought myself an expensive negligee.
GABRIELLE: I hope you won't be angry with me. I bought myself an expensive negligee.
HOLMES: Did you?
GABRIELLE: ( moving toward bed ) A pink negligee with maribou feathers. Don't you think that's a foolish thing for a married woman? ( she gets into bed, beckons Where is the negligee?
HOLMES: Where is the negligee?
GABRIELLE: In my luggage. Come here.
HOLMES: ( moving toward her ) And where is your luggage?
GABRIELLE: ( impatiently ) I don't know. Come, my love. Come. What is it, Emile? What are you doing?
GABRIELLE: What is it, Emile? What are you doing?
MRS. HUDSON: Dr. Watson! Your porridge is getting lumpy. Hadn't you better get up?
WATSON: I would like to very much. But Mrs. Hudson, would you mind planting your knee in the small of my back?
MRS. HUDSON: Yes, I would.
WATSON: Please! I'm in excruciating pain.
WATSON: A bit higher just below my seventh That's good. Put your arms under mine fold them behind my neck Bless you. That damn couch. You'd better see if our patient is awake.
WATSON: Bless you. That damn couch. You'd better see if our patient is awake.
MRS. HUDSON: Dr. Watson. She's gone.
WATSON: He jumps up from the table, joins Mrs. Hudson, looks past her. The bed is empty. Gabrielle's clothes are in evidence, but there is no sign of her. Watson strides towards Holmes' bedroom.
WATSON: Holmes! Holmes! She's gone!
MRS. HUDSON: ( scandalized ) Well, I never!
HOLMES: ( inhaling deeply ) Mmmmm. I smell porridge. Lumpy as usual, I suppose.
WATSON: Oh, there you are, Holmes. We were just wondering how
MRS. HUDSON: ( sternly ) We certainly were.
HOLMES: Mrs. Hudson, why don't you go down to the kitchen get a towel and wipe that look of disapproval off your face.
MRS. HUDSON: Liberties in my house!
WATSON: You can't really blame her I mean, the way it looks if I didn't know you better, I might suspect you'd taken advantage of the young lady.
HOLMES: As a matter of fact, I did take advantage of her. Would you hand me the butter- knife, please?
WATSON: Of course.
WATSON: You did what?
HOLMES: ( taking butter-knife from Thank you. ( spluttering ) Holmes, this is reprehensible! Where are your professional ethics? Have you no sense of decency, no shame
WATSON: ( spluttering ) Holmes, this is reprehensible! Where are your professional ethics? Have you no sense of decency, no shame
HOLMES: None whatsoever. If you must know, I found her body quite rewarding.
WATSON: You cad!
HOLMES: Especially the palm of her right hand.
WATSON: I'd rather not hear about it!
HOLMES: Very well. Then I won't bother to tell you how I traced her suitcase.
WATSON: That's her suitcase?
HOLMES: Remember that piece of soggy cardboard with our address on it? It was a luggage ticket the number rubbed off on her hand. And since she must have arrived from Brussels by the boat train, I concluded that she had checked her belongings at Victoria Station.
WATSON: By Jove! If you're right, we should find a clue to her identity.
HOLMES: Or at least a pink negligee with maribou Let's see - what else is in here?
HOLMES: Let's see - what else is in here?
WATSON: Let's see - what else is in here?
HOLMES: Now we're getting somewhere.
WATSON: Who do you suppose this is?
HOLMES: Come in, Madame Valladon. You are Gabrielle Valladon.
GABRIELLE: ( holding up photo ) And this is your husband, Emile Valladon?
HOLMES: ( holding up photo ) And this is your husband, Emile Valladon?
GABRIELLE: Her eyes fall on the open suitcase.
HOLMES: Sorry to have ransacked your valise. But since you came to us for help
GABRIELLE: Where am I?
WATSON: 221B Baker Street.
GABRIELLE: Oh, yes. Which of you is Mr. Holmes and which is Dr. Watson?
HOLMES: Dr. Watson is the handsome one.
HOLMES: That's the way he affects most women.
WATSON: ( to Gabrielle ) Coffee. You want strong coffee.
GABRIELLE: It's all so confusing.
HOLMES: Let's try to sort it out. You came to London looking for your husband.
GABRIELLE: Yes. He's a mining engineer. We were married five years ago, in the Congo.
HOLMES: Where your husband was working in a copper mine.
GABRIELLE: How did you know?
HOLMES: Your wedding ring it's made of copper.
GABRIELLE: Last year he invented a new kind of air pump, and was hired by an English company, Jonah Limited.
WATSON: ( handing her cup of of Here you are.
HOLMES: Jonah Limited. Go on.
GABRIELLE: We've been writing to each other regularly. Then suddenly, three weeks ago, his letters stopped. I kept writing . but no answer. Finally I decided to go to that address
HOLMES: 32 Ashdown Street.
GABRIELLE: Yes. It's just an empty store nobody there. Then I tried to find Jonah Limited. No such company exists.
WATSON: How decidedly odd.
HOLMES: Madame Valladon, can you think of any reason why your husband should have lied to you about theses things?
GABRIELLE: Emile? Never. He loves me and I love So I gathered.
HOLMES: So I gathered.
GABRIELLE: I went to the police they said they would send out a missing persons report but they didn't sound too encouraging. Then I went to the Belgian embassy and explained the situation to them and they suggested that I consult you.
WATSON: You could have done worse.
GABRIELLE: I was on my way here and suddenly there were footsteps behind me and a hand over my mouth and the smell of choloroform and the next thing I knew I was in the water and then a man was wrapping me in a blanket
HOLMES: Madame Valladon, somebody tried to kill you last night. Do you have any idea who could have done it?
GABRIELLE: I don't understand any of it. What does it all mean, Mr. Holmes? Where is my husband? You must help me find We'll do our best, I assure you.
WATSON: We'll do our best, I assure you.
HOLMES: Madame Valladon, I want you to send one more letter to your husband.
HOLMES: To Emile Valladon Ashdown Street what was that number?
GABRIELLE: ( addressing envelope ) 32. What do you want me to say in the
HOLMES: He folds the blank sheet of paper, and as Gabrielle finishes addressing the envelope, he inserts the paper in it, starts to seal it.
WATSON: You're sending an empty sheet of paper to an empty shop?
HOLMES: That empty shop is obviously being used as an accomodation address, or letter- drop. But what gets dropped must be picked up. The question is how? and by whom? and why?
HOLMES: Hammer. Chisel.
WATSON: He hands the tools to Holmes, jumps to the floor. Gabrielle is looking around the shop.
GABRIELLE: It's so strange to think I've been writing to a place like this all these
WATSON: Look at all these canaries. Do you suppose this could have been a pet shop?
HOLMES: ( pointing off ) Here comes our letter.
HOLMES: Now we are faced with the most nerve- wracking part of the detective's job doing nothing.
GABRIELLE: Mr. Holmes
HOLMES: I don't know how I'm going to pay you for all this. The purse with my money is somewhere at the bottom of the Thames.
GABRIELLE: I don't know how I'm going to pay you for all this. The purse with my money is somewhere at the bottom of the Thames.
HOLMES: It could be worse. You could be at the bottom of the Thames much to your discomfort and much to my chagrin.
WATSON: I don't understand how anybody picks up letters here. No footprints just tracks. What does it mean?
HOLMES: I would surmise somebody is using ice- skates if it weren't for a conspicuous absence of ice.
WATSON: ( in a frantic whisper ) What do we do now?
HOLMES: ( unfazed ) This way.
FIRST CARTER: Morning, Duchess.
SECOND CARTER: What have you been doing with yourself?
FIRST CARTER: Two dozen.
SECOND CARTER: Look, Duchess, we don't know and we don't want to know.
FIRST CARTER: When you work for Jonah, it's better not to ask questions.
FIRST CARTER: ( counting as he transfers . twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty- How about that letter? Does that go, No. That's going to be picked up in
SECOND CARTER: How about that letter? Does that go, No. That's going to be picked up in
WATSON: ( a sigh of relief ) I really thought we were done for.
HOLMES: ( casually ) The art of concealment, my dear Watson, is merely a matter of being in the right place at the right time.
GABRIELLE: Did you hear what she said? You really think Emile is going to pick up the letter himself?
HOLMES: It certainly would simplify things, wouldn't it?
WATSON: ( shaking his head ) Maildrops and canaries and wheelchairs. And what was all that about Jonah? And what do you suppose they're doing up there? And where is up there?
HOLMES: My guess would be Scotland. Inverness, to be more precise.
WATSON: Didn't you notice the paper at the bottom of their cage? The Inverness Courier. Mr. Holmes! This letter
HOLMES: Didn't you notice the paper at the bottom of their cage? The Inverness Courier. Mr. Holmes! This letter
GABRIELLE: Mr. Holmes! This letter
HOLMES: What about it?
GABRIELLE: ( holding it out to him ) It's addressed to you.
HOLMES: With the saw-end of his cane, he slits the envelope open, removes the enclosure, unfolds it. We see the letter in his hand as he reads it out loud. The letterhead says: DIOGENES CLUB, St. James's, London.
HOLMES: ( reading ) My Dear Sherlock: I expect you and Dr. Watson to join me at the club immediately upon reciept of this note. According to my calculations, that should be at 11:40 a.m. Your brother, Mycroft. ( looking up ) What time do you make it, Watson?
WATSON: ( consulting watch )
HOLMES: Either your watch is wrong, or Mycroft has miscalculated. And knowing Mycroft, I suggest you reset your watch.
WATSON: I don't mind telling you I'm a bit apprehensive about this.
HOLMES: I'm rather curious myself as to what is going on in that Machiavellian mind of I don't mean Mycroft, I mean Madame Don't worry. She's perfectly safe with Mrs. Hudson.
WATSON: I don't mean Mycroft, I mean Madame Don't worry. She's perfectly safe with Mrs. Hudson.
HOLMES: Don't worry. She's perfectly safe with Mrs. Hudson.
HOLMES: ( to porter ) To see Mr. Mycroft Holmes.
PORTER: Right you are. He's expecting you in the upstairs study. Now if you gentlemen will sign in Surname, Christian name, address, nature of business
PORTER: READING ROOM - DIOGENES CLUB - DAY A huge room, with more marble than a mausoleum, and just about as lively.
HOLMES: Jamaican, no doubt either Tropical or Golosina I'm not quite sure.
MYCROFT: ( without turning ) Come in, come in, Sherlock Dr. Watson. Sit down. ( Holmes and Watson seat You're looking very fit, both of you.
WATSON: Thank you.
HOLMES: ( putting down hat and cane ) And how are you, Mycroft? How's your Under control. Except for the occasional I have a treat for you a very old Madeira 1814. There are only six bottles left in the world. I have two of them, and am negotiating for a third.

MYCROFT: I have a treat for you a very old Madeira 1814. There are only six bottles left in the world. I have two of them, and am negotiating for a third.
WATSON: If you don't mind my saying so, anybody who's susceptible to gout shouldn't be
MYCROFT: The last doctor who warned me about that was crossing Piccadilly, slipped on an orange peel, and was run over by a delivery van from the Fortnum and Mason. Your very good health.
HOLMES: Why are you wasting this precious stuff on us?
MYCROFT: Well, I see you so rarely. How long has it been? Not since the case of the Greek Isn't it ridiculous? Two brothers living in the same town.
HOLMES: In the same town, perhaps but not the same world.
WATSON: ( taking another sip ) Mmmm. Superb. How old did you say it ( turning to Holmes ) And speaking of Belgium, it has come to my attention that you are interested in the whereabouts of a certain engineer.
MYCROFT: ( turning to Holmes ) And speaking of Belgium, it has come to my attention that you are interested in the whereabouts of a certain engineer.
WATSON: ( turning to Holmes ) And speaking of Belgium, it has come to my attention that you are interested in the whereabouts of a certain engineer.

MYCROFT: security. We are handling this matter
WATSON: The Diogenes Club, of course.
HOLMES: The Diogenes Club, of course.
MYCROFT: I didn't say that.
HOLMES: I have always suspected that there was some underground connection between this stodgy and seemingly calcified establishment and the Foreign Office in That's neither here nor there.
MYCROFT: That's neither here nor there.
HOLMES: It seems to me that The Diogenes Club is here, there and everywhere. When there are rumblings of revolt in the Sudan, an expedition subsidized by your club conveniently shows up to study the source of the Nile. When there is trouble along the Indian frontier, some of your fellow members pop up in the Himalayas, alledgedly looking for the Abominable
MYCROFT: ( to Watson ) What a fertile imagination my brother has. At the age of five, by carefully observing a neighbor's house, he deduced that babies were brought not by the stork, but by the mid-wife in her As good an explanation as any.
WATSON: As good an explanation as any.
MYCROFT: Yes, Wiggins?
YOUNG MAN: An immediate answer is requested, sir.
MYCROFT: Tell them that the three boxes go to Glennahurich, and the red runner goes to the castle.
YOUNG MAN: The three boxes to Glennahurich, the red runner to the castle. Very good, sir.
HOLMES: Why don't you crumple it up and swallow it to make sure.
MYCROFT: My dear Sherlock, there are certain affairs that do not come within the province of the private detective. They have to be dealt with on an altogether different level.
HOLMES: In other words, you want me to stay within my limits.
MYCROFT: I do indeed.
HOLMES: Speaking of limits, what exactly is Jonah Sherlock, when I said drop this case, it was not merely a suggestion it was an By whose authority?
MYCROFT: Sherlock, when I said drop this case, it was not merely a suggestion it was an By whose authority?
HOLMES: By whose authority?
MYCROFT: By the authority of Her Majesty's government. I hope I've made myself
WATSON: In his nervousness he drops his bowler, which rolls along the floor.
MYCROFT: Now if you'll excuse me, gentlemen
WATSON: Goodbye, sir.
HOLMES: A pleasure, as always.
MYCROFT: ( to Holmes ) Just a minute. ( picks up Holmes' cane ) You forgot your tool-kit.
WATSON: You will be gentle, won't you, when you tell her you're dropping the case?
HOLMES: Watson, what does the word Glennahurich suggest to you?
WATSON: Absolutely nothing.
HOLMES: It's Scottish.
WATSON: Is it?
HOLMES: And like all Scottish names, it's really a word picture. Glen means valley, na means of the, and Hurich, if memory serves me, means yew tree.
WATSON: You're just trying to impress me.
HOLMES: So the three boxes go to the Valley of the Yew Tree.
WATSON: ( singing along ) And I'll be in Scotland before ye. ( breaks off, looks at Holmes You are dropping the case, aren't you, Open the door. Don't shoot, Mrs. Hudson you're liable to lose two excellent tenants.
HOLMES: Open the door. Don't shoot, Mrs. Hudson you're liable to lose two excellent tenants.
HOLMES: Don't shoot, Mrs. Hudson you're liable to lose two excellent tenants.
MRS. HUDSON: Oh, at last. It's been a ghastly Why? What happened?
WATSON: Why? What happened?
MRS. HUDSON: Did you ever try doing embroidery with a gun in your hand?
HOLMES: ( taking gun from her ) You'll be relieved to know it was not
WATSON: Holmes, you didn't answer my question. Are you planning to disobey Mycroft's orders? He's not just your brother, you know. You'd be defying Her Majesty's
GABRIELLE: Any news? Did you find out anything?
HOLMES: Let's just say I know what the next step will be.
GABRIELLE: ( anxious ) I want you to pack your things.
HOLMES: I want you to pack your things.
GABRIELLE: Where are we going?
WATSON: Holmes, let me caution you -
HOLMES: ( to Gabrielle ) At 7:30 this evening, Dr. Watson and I are going to take you to Victoria Station, and put you on the boat-train.
GABRIELLE: The boat-train?
WATSON: Well, that's better.
GABRIELLE: You're sending me back to Brussels? Is that it?
WATSON: Madame Valladon, you must understand.
GABRIELLE: ( to Holmes, agitated ) I came here to find my husband you were going to help me
WATSON: Yes, my dear. But circumstances have The great detective! Well, maybe this case is too small for you
GABRIELLE: The great detective! Well, maybe this case is too small for you
WATSON: On the contrary. It's being handled at a much higher level
GABRIELLE: Well, I won't go back to Brussels. Maybe you're giving up, but I'm not. I'm going to go on looking for him. And nobody's going to stop me even if they try to kill me.
HOLMES: ( looking up from railway Are you quite finished? If you recall, what I said was that we're going to put you on the boat-train I didn't say you were going to stay on it.
WATSON: She's not?
HOLMES: At 7:30, Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson will be seen waving goodbye to Madame Valladon at Victoria Station. At eight-twelve, Mr. and Mrs. Ashdown accompanied by their valet John will appear at Euston Station, and board the Highland Express to Inverness.
WATSON: Mr. and Mrs.. ?
GABRIELLE: ( moving toward Holmes ) Thank you. I'm sorry for what I said. ( kisses him on cheek )
HOLMES: That's not necessary.
GABRIELLE: ( smiling through tears ) I'll go and pack.
WATSON: ( acidly ) Maybe I should do it, since I'm the
WATSON: Holmes, what exactly are you up to?
HOLMES: As you like to put it in your chronicles, the game is afoot.
WATSON: But what game? Are you really that interested in the Belgian engineer?
WATSON: Or the wife of the Belgian engineer? You don't like me very much, do you?
GABRIELLE: You don't like me very much, do you?
WATSON: Nothing of the sort. Quite the opposite. But there's more to this case than meets the eye
WATSON: Looking for something?
GABRIELLE: My other glove.
WATSON: Let me help you.
WATSON: Here it is.
GABRIELLE: Thank you.
HOLMES: All right. You can look now.
GABRIELLE: Am I embarrassing you, Mr. Holmes?
HOLMES: Not at all. Would it surprise you if I told you I once spent the night with 121 On a very interesting case in a harem in Constantinople.
GABRIELLE: On a very interesting case in a harem in Constantinople.
HOLMES: On a very interesting case in a harem in Constantinople.
WATSON: Sorry, father I mean, friar or is it abbot?
WATSON: Going to Scotland, you gentlemen? So are
WATSON: I'm a valet. My master and mistress and I are our way to Inverness. Ever been there? Beautiful country.
WATSON: Oh, forgive me. You must be one of those orders that's taken the vow of silence. Trappists, I believe you're called.
WATSON: I see you're reading the book of Jonah. Funny - we were just talking about Johan this morning. Never mind.
GABRIELLE: Women are never to be trusted entirely not the best of them.
HOLMES: What did you say?
GABRIELLE: I didn't say it you did. According to Dr. Watson.
HOLMES: words into my mouth.
GABRIELLE: words into my mouth.
HOLMES: words into my mouth.
GABRIELLE: admirer of womankind.
HOLMES: admirer of womankind.
GABRIELLE: was a murderess.
HOLMES: was a murderess.
GABRIELLE: at odd hours right in my laboratory. And all the time, behind my back, she was stealing cyanide to sprinkle on her husband's steak and kidney pie.
HOLMES: at odd hours right in my laboratory. And all the time, behind my back, she was stealing cyanide to sprinkle on her husband's steak and kidney pie.
GABRIELLE: involved with. And I don't just mean professionally kleptomaniacs, nymphomaniacs, pyromaniacs. Take my fiancee, for instance
HOLMES: involved with. And I don't just mean professionally kleptomaniacs, nymphomaniacs, pyromaniacs. Take my fiancee, for instance
GABRIELLE: She was the daughter of my violin teacher we were engaged to be married the invitations were out, I was being fitted for a tail-coat and twenty-four hours before the wedding, she died of I'm sorry.
HOLMES: She was the daughter of my violin teacher we were engaged to be married the invitations were out, I was being fitted for a tail-coat and twenty-four hours before the wedding, she died of I'm sorry.
GABRIELLE: I'm sorry.
HOLMES: It just proves my contention that women are unreliable and not to be trusted. Good night, Mrs. Ashdown.
GABRIELLE: Good night, Mr. Ashdown.
MONK: ( in a whisper ) Die Spur fuehrt nach Inverness. Die steigen dort aus. Dort muessen wir ihn finded den Valladon!
WATSON: Let's see two, three, four
GABRIELLE: I'll take that.
HOLMES: ( to baggageman ) How do you get to Glennahurich? How far is it?
BAGGAGEMAN: You know a valley with a yew tree. ?
WATSON: You know a valley with a yew tree. ?
BAGGAGEMAN: It's about a mile out of town. Why would you be wanting to go there?
WATSON: Well, if it's got a view, it might be a nice place for a picnic.
BAGGAGEMAN: It's got a view, right enough but it's no place for a picnic.
HOLMES: Why not?
BAGGAGEMAN: Because it's a cemetary.
WATSON: ( a note of excitement ) The three boxes. Is that it, Holmes?
HOLMES: I would think so.
GABRIELLE: The two small ones they must be children's coffins.
MINISTER: . earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
GABRIELLE: It's so sad.
HOLMES: Sad and rather odd. There are no flowers and no mourners.
HOLMES: ( looking up ) Working you hard, Dad?
HOLMES: Working you hard, Dad?
HOLMES: What happened?
HOLMES: Local people?
HOLMES: What do you believe?
WATSON: Are you trying to tell us it was the Damn right. MacLarnin saw the kids' faces when they were pulled out of the water looked like old men must've died of fright.
WATSON: Is it? Last Easter Sunday my wife and me, we were on our way to services, when suddenly. But what's the use?
HOLMES: ( taking some coins out of his Here you are, Dad. ( hands them to the grave-
WATSON: ( snorting ) To think that people still believe in that nonsense. Here we are, living in the Nineteenth Century
GABRIELLE: I'm ashamed to admit it but I was relieved when he mentioned a father and two boys. It could possibly have anything to do with Emile.
HOLMES: It would appear not.
WATSON: However, there still remains the clue of the castle and the red runner wherever it may be.
WATSON: If they're unidentified graves, why are those boys bringing flowers?
HOLMES: Because it's their brothers who have just been buried.
WATSON: Their brothers?
HOLMES: And they're not boys. They're as tall as they'll ever grow. Hand me some pebbles, will you?
WATSON: He picks some up from the ground, hands them to Holmes, who tosses them in the direction of the graves. The pebbles strike a granite cross. At the sound, the four boys simultaneously turn their heads over their shoulders. Despite their slight bodies they have the features of mature men. Gabrielle and Watson react to the sight.
GABRIELLE: They are how do you say it in English? Boys with the faces of old men.
WATSON: ( nodding ) Boys with the faces of old men.
HOLMES: ( nodding ) Boys with the faces of old men.
WATSON: I still don't see
HOLMES: Would it help if I told you they were Not at all.
WATSON: Not at all.
HOLMES: Do you remember a tumbling act six brothers missing from the circus?
WATSON: Oh, yes that case you turned down I completely forgot.
HOLMES: Some of us are cursed with memories like flypaper. And stuck there is a staggering of miscellaneous date, mostly
GABRIELLE: ( worriedly ) Mr. Holmes, is those are not children, then ?
HOLMES: Quite. The question now is who's in the third grave?
WATSON: Holmes! She's fainted.
HOLMES: ( preoccupied ) Hand me that lantern.
WATSON: It is Valladon, isn't it?
HOLMES: Obviously. What is not so obvious is why his wedding ring has turned green
HOLMES: and why there are three dead canaries in the coffin. White canaries.
MANAGER: You have a lovely view of the loch from here as soon as the morning mist rolls If you've a mind to do any sight-seeing, here's a guide to the local points of Thank you.
HOLMES: Thank you.
MANAGER: This way, please. I will show you to your

MANAGER: No, your room is in the attic.
WATSON: It's the privy that's in the basement.
MANAGER: It's the privy that's in the basement.
HOLMES: May I have your wedding ring, please?
HOLMES: Just as I thought. There is a distinct difference in color between your ring and your husband's. Which leads me to believe that the cause of death was not drowning. I wish you would stop that. Stop it!
GABRIELLE: I'm sorry.
HOLMES: I know it's not easy. But you must remember that we're that nice couple from London, on Holiday in the Highlands.
GABRIELLE: ( a final sniffle ) I'll try.
HOLMES: That's much better.
GABRIELLE: Thank you.
HOLMES: ( gruffly ) Now, if I may proceed without further ( from off ) Mr. Ashdown!
WATSON'S VOICE: ( from off ) Mr. Ashdown!
WATSON: Mr. Ashdown!
WATSON: Holmes! I saw it! I saw it from the attic! It's out there in the lake!
HOLMES: You saw what?
WATSON: ( looking around desperately ) The telescope. Where's the telescope?
HOLMES: What did you see?
WATSON: The monster!
HOLMES: The monster?
WATSON: There it is! There it is!
WATSON: Look for yourself.
WATSON: See it? See it?
HOLMES: I see nothing.
WATSON: He grabs the telescope from Holmes, looks toward the
WATSON: It's gone.
HOLMES: Gone? Maybe it was never there.
WATSON: I swear to you I saw it clear as Watson, as you so succinctly put it, we are living in the Nineteenth Century
HOLMES: Watson, as you so succinctly put it, we are living in the Nineteenth Century
WATSON: Maybe that grave-digger was right the swell, and the boat overturning
HOLMES: Monsieur Valladon may have been found in the lake but he did not drown. He died of asphyxiation.
GABRIELLE: ( holding up wedding rings ) There is only one substance that can turn a copper ring green and bleach the color out of canaries chlorine gas.
HOLMES: ( holding up wedding rings ) There is only one substance that can turn a copper ring green and bleach the color out of canaries chlorine gas.
WATSON: That may be. But the fact remains that I saw something out there.
HOLMES: A figment of your imagination. Now let us be logical. The only concrete lead we have is the reference to the castle The question is, which castle?
WATSON: You call yourself logical? You're the least logical man I know.
HOLMES: Am I?
WATSON: How can you say it's a figment of my imagination, when for years you've been saying I have no imagination whatsoever!
WATSON: We have so far investigated eight drafty castles had our bicycles attacked by sheep and our ears assaulted by bagpipes and we are exactly where we started.
HOLMES: ( to Gabrielle ) Would you like some cranberry sauce, Yes, dear.
GABRIELLE: Yes, dear.
HOLMES: Would you pass the cranberry sauce, please, John?
WATSON: Yes, dear.
WATSON: ( calling ) I say there. Good afternoon. Remember ( to Holmes ) Some chaps I met on the train. We had a long conversation or rather, I had a long conversation because they're not allowed to talk Trappists, you know. Just study their Bibles. You'll never guess what the one next to me was reading the Book of Jonah isn't that odd?

HOLMES: ( looking after the monks )
HOLMES: What is it, dear? What's the matter?
GABRIELLE: A bee.
WATSON: Well, I don't think we have to bother with this castle. It's just a pile of Then why are they taking precautions?
GABRIELLE: Then why are they taking precautions?
HOLMES: Why, indeed? Let's go.
WATSON: Go where?
HOLMES: When rebuffed at the front door, one's only choice is to try the tradesmen's
GUIDE: Sorry. No visitors allowed.
HOLMES: Are you the guide here?
GUIDE: Yes. The castle is closed to the public while work is going on.
HOLMES: What are they doing?
GUIDE: It's being restored by the Society for the Preservation of Scottish Monuments.
HOLMES: Too bad. I particularly wanted my wife to see Urquhart Castle. The tower is one of the most interesting examples of about 1400, wasn't it?
GUIDE: That's right.
HOLMES: Let me see was it built under James the Second or James the Third?
GUIDE: The Thrid. If you come back next year, we'll be all done here, and I'll be glad to show you around.
HOLMES: Thank you.
WATSON: Pleasant sort, isn't he?
HOLMES: Pleasant, but ignorant. He was off one hundred years and one James. It's actually 1500 and James the Fourth.
GABRIELLE: If he's an official guide, shouldn't he know. ?
HOLMES: If he's an official guide.
HOLMES: Listen. Do you hear anything, Watson?
WATSON: ( concentrating ) No. Those birds are making too much of a ( looking off ) They're not just birds they're our old
HOLMES: ( looking off ) They're not just birds they're our old
WATSON: Sulphuric acid?
GABRIELLE: The more we find out the less sense it To a graduate chemist it makes a great deal of sense. Sulphuric acid, when exposed to salt-water, produces chlorine Would you mind clasping your hands, Like this?
HOLMES: To a graduate chemist it makes a great deal of sense. Sulphuric acid, when exposed to salt-water, produces chlorine Would you mind clasping your hands, Like this?
WATSON: ( obeying ) Like this?
HOLMES: A little lower. Thank you.
HOLMES: ( looking off ) That tower may be more interesting than I thought and not just architecturally.
WATSON: Holmes, I have a feeling we're redundant
WATSON: We have now observed the castle from the front, from the back, from the side, from land, from water. what now? Are you planning to spend the night out here?
HOLMES: If necessary.
WATSON: You're going to catch your death of cold. Wouldn't it be ironic if Holmes' last case were a case of pneumonia?
GABRIELLE: ( pointing off ) What's that?
WATSON: Holmes grabs his arm, pulls him back into his seat.
HOLMES: Quick, Watson. After it!
WATSON: Holmes, what are we doing? We should be going away from it.
HOLMES: Keep rowing, dammit!
HOLMES: We've lost it.
WATSON: ( stops rowing ) At least you admit there's an it, not just a figment of my imagination.
HOLMES: He listens intently. There is only the sound of water slapping against the side of the boat. The mist is heavier now, and billowing around them.
HOLMES: ( to Watson ) Do you have your stethoscope with you?
WATSON: Never without it. What is it?
WATSON: What is it?
HOLMES: I can hear something.
HOLMES: It's getting closer closer
HOLMES: Are you all right?
GABRIELLE: I lost my parasol.
HOLMES: Where's Watson?
HOLMES: He lifts the hat but Watson isn't under it. As Gabrielle hoists herself into the boat, Watson clambers over the other side. After a moment Holmes joins them, and they sit there, sopping wet and breathing
WATSON: I have come face to face with man-eating tigers I was once caught in a stampede of wild elephants India, you know but I wasn't half as frightened. This beast seems to have a personal grudge against us.
GABRIELLE: I just hope it doesn't come back.
HOLMES: I don't think it will.
WATSON: ( amazed ) What strange goings-on.
HOLMES: Not really. My guess is that the monster, after a hard day's work, has returned home for his supper.
WATSON: Yes, I know. But would you believe that you can't borrow a decent pair of trousers in this place? Would you like to confide in us?
WATSON: Would you like to confide in us?
WATSON: Whenever he starts whistling, I know he's getting close to a solution.
HOLMES: It's nothing new, actually. We've come across this situation before.
WATSON: We have? Where?
HOLMES: At the ballet.
WATSON: and there's a swan that isn't really a swan or, in this case, a monster that isn't really a monster
HOLMES: and there's a swan that isn't really a swan or, in this case, a monster that isn't really a monster

HOLMES: Why did they try to keep me from finding my husband? And why was he buried I think I have a pretty good notion of what they're up to the Society for the Preservation of Scottish Monuments better known as the Diogenes Club.

HOLMES: I think I have a pretty good notion of what they're up to the Society for the Preservation of Scottish Monuments better known as the Diogenes Club.
WATSON: The Diogenes Club?
HOLMES: Come in.
MANAGER: Mr. Ashdown, I have a bottle of champagne for you.
HOLMES: ( crossing to him ) A bottle of champagne? I didn't order No, indeed. You are to deliver it. These are my instructions.
MANAGER: No, indeed. You are to deliver it. These are my instructions.
HOLMES: Instructions from whom? Deliver it I wouldn't know, sir. But there's a carriage waiting for you downstairs.
MANAGER: I wouldn't know, sir. But there's a carriage waiting for you downstairs.
HOLMES: Are you sure you have the right Mr. Quite sure, Mr. Holmes. Well, Watson, I would say the curtain is going up on the last act.
MANAGER: ( flatly ) Quite sure, Mr. Holmes. Well, Watson, I would say the curtain is going up on the last act.
HOLMES: Well, Watson, I would say the curtain is going up on the last act.
WATSON: I don't like the sound of it.
GABRIELLE: Please be careful. You'd better take this with you.
WATSON: You'd better take this with you.
HOLMES: Who's minding the castle?
GUIDE: You'd better get on. It's late.
HOLMES: Where are we going? Some sort of party?
GUIDE: You won't be disappointed in the guest Who's the host?
HOLMES: Who's the host?
GUIDE: He flicks the reins. The horse starts off at a trot, and the gig turns into the driveway.
MYCROFT: Mr. Ashdown, I presume.
HOLMES: ( turning ) The red runner, I presume.
MYCROFT: It's not for you. May I have the champagne, please?
HOLMES: ( handing him bottle ) 1886 not a very good vintage, is it?
MYCROFT: Mediocre. But then again, it's not for
MYCROFT: Tie it up, will you?
MYCROFT: In here.
HOLMES: Interesting and educational.
MYCROFT: persisted in meddling. It would have served you right if you'd all drowned.
HOLMES: ( stops beside torch ) E. Valladon. H'mm.
MYCROFT: ( indicating parasol and I imagine this belongs to the pretty lady, and this belongs to your valet. We found them floating in the lake.
HOLMES: underwater craft camouflauged to mislead the gullible. I think it's an experimental model, operated by a crew of midgets. I think it is powered by sulphuric acid batteries, and uses canaries to detect escaping gas. Altogether a strange contraption.

HOLMES: lived in the belly of that fish for three days and three nights."
MYCROFT: Valladon's air-pump, we got a jump on the rest of them. It's a highly complex system of filtration so we had a series of trials
HOLMES: pressure caused a leak in the hull. Sea water mixed with the acid in the batteries to produce chlorine gas. Before they could reach the surface, Valladon and the crew were dead.

HOLMES: graves, to preserve your secret.
MYCROFT: from your client.
HOLMES: Madame Valladon from fiding her husband?
MYCROFT: the Imperial German Government. They were after the Belgian engineer or rather, his invention. They knew he was employed by us, but they couldn't find out where so they enlisted the best brain in England to help them. You, my dear brother, have been working for the play in all this?
HOLMES: play in all this?
MYCROFT: Mycroft crosses to the trunk, opens the lid.
HOLMES: Mycroft crosses to the trunk, opens the lid.
MYCROFT: The Germans disposed of her three weeks ago, in Brussels. This is Gabrielle
MYCROFT: The woman who was brought to your house in the middle of the night apparently fished out of the Thames and apparently suffering from amnesia is, in fact, Ilse von Hoffmanstal, one of their most skillful agents. Am I going too fast for one of the "best brains in Go on.
HOLMES: Go on.
MYCROFT: They planted her on you quite neatly, I must admit, so that you could lead them to their objective, the air pump. Very much like using a hog to find truffles. And now perhaps you'd care to join me. I am expecting a certain royal personage from Balmoral.
MYCROFT: Your Majesty.
MYCROFT: I trust you had a pleasant journey, It was long and it was tedious. And it had better be worth our while, Mr. I can assure you, Ma'am, it will be. Now what is this curious ship we are supposed to christen?
QUEEN VICTORIA: It was long and it was tedious. And it had better be worth our while, Mr. I can assure you, Ma'am, it will be. Now what is this curious ship we are supposed to christen?
MYCROFT: I can assure you, Ma'am, it will be. Now what is this curious ship we are supposed to christen?
QUEEN VICTORIA: Now what is this curious ship we are supposed to christen?
MYCROFT: We call it a submersible, Ma'am. It travels under water.
QUEEN VICTORIA: Under water? What a fantastic idea.
MYCROFT: who were responsible for this achievement. J.W. Ferguson, naval Your Majesty.
FIRST SCIENTIST: ( bowing ) Your Majesty.
MYCROFT: SECOND SCIENTIST ( bowing )
SECOND SCIENTIST: ( bowing ) Your Majesty.
MYCROFT: revolving periscope
THIRD SCIENTIST: ( bowing ) Your Majesty.

QUEEN VICTORIA: But England is proud of you, gentlemen. To think that man can now observe fish in their native habitat
MYCROFT: ( trying to correct her ) Well, not exactly, Ma'am
QUEEN VICTORIA: ( noticing Holmes ) Young man what was your contribution to this project?
HOLMES: ( to the Queen ) This is my brother, Sherlock, Ma'am.
MYCROFT: ( to the Queen ) This is my brother, Sherlock, Ma'am.
QUEEN VICTORIA: Ah, yes. Sherlock Holmes. We have been following your exploits with great
HOLMES: Thank you, Ma'am.
QUEEN VICTORIA: Are you engaged in one of your fascinating cases at the moment?
HOLMES: In a manner of speaking, Ma'am.
QUEEN VICTORIA: When can we expect to read Dr. Watson's account of the case?
HOLMES: I hope never, Ma'am. It has not been one of my more successful endeavors.
QUEEN VICTORIA: Ah, the ceremonies are about to begin. Now where is this underwater ship of In the dungeon, Ma'am.
MYCROFT: ( pointing to tower ) In the dungeon, Ma'am.
QUEEN VICTORIA: The dungeon? What a peculiar place to keep it. Well, let us get on with it, gentlemen.
MYCROFT: There she, Ma'am. Her Majesty's Ship
QUEEN VICTORIA: And what, may we ask, is the purpose of that hideous gargoyle?
MYCROFT: It's merely a decoy, Ma'am.
QUEEN VICTORIA: Oh. To frighten away the sharks, we Something of the sort. The crew will now demonstrate the workings of the

SAILOR: Stand to.
QUEEN VICTORIA: Aren't they rather small for sailors?
MYCROFT: They are. But because of the size of the craft, the Navy made an exception.
QUEEN VICTORIA: They should make it a rule. It's quite fatiguing to pin on all those medals while standing on our toes.
MYCROFT: This is the main engine, which propels it under water at the rate of two knots the stabilizing mechanism the multi- stage compressor the ballast tank trimmer the air-pump which filters and recirculates the air
QUEEN VICTORIA: How charming.
MYCROFT: The air pump, Ma'am?

QUEEN VICTORIA: But where is the glass bottom?
MYCROFT: The what, Ma'am?
QUEEN VICTORIA: The glass bottom.
HOLMES: You know to see the fist
QUEEN VICTORIA: and the plants and the corals
MYCROFT: That's not quite the idea, Ma'am. H.M.S. Jonah is being commissioned as a warship.
QUEEN VICTORIA: A warship? Stop that noise. Stop it!
MYCROFT: Ma'am, if I may explain
QUEEN VICTORIA: You had better.
MYCROFT: The Admiralty regards this craft as the ultimate weapon in naval warfare. It can seek out enemy ships and destroy them with these torpedoes while remaining completely invisible.
QUEEN VICTORIA: You mean in can fire at other vessels while under water?
MYCROFT: Yes, Ma'am.
QUEEN VICTORIA: Without any warning?
MYCROFT: That is correct, Ma'am.
QUEEN VICTORIA: And without showing her colors?
MYCROFT: Indeed, Ma'am.
QUEEN VICTORIA: Mr. Holmes, we are not amused. It is unsportsmanlike, it is un-English, and it is in very poor taste. We will have none of it!
MYCROFT: I beg your pardon, Ma'am?
QUEEN VICTORIA: Sometimes we despair of the state of the world. What will scientists think of That's precisely it, Ma'am. At this very moment the Germans under Count von Zeppelin, are experimenting with a A dirigible? And what, pray, is that?
MYCROFT: That's precisely it, Ma'am. At this very moment the Germans under Count von Zeppelin, are experimenting with a A dirigible? And what, pray, is that?
QUEEN VICTORIA: A dirigible? And what, pray, is that?
MYCROFT: A rigid balloon, which could fly over London and drop a bomb on Buckingham Palace. It is being developed at the express orders of Kaiser Wilhelm the Nonsense. We refuse to believe that our grandson Willie would do a thing like We have conclusive proof, Ma'am. Our agent in Friedrichshafen, a man named Ibbetson, actually saw the dirigible, and made a drawing of it. Unfortunately, he was apprehended before he could cross the Nevertheless, we don't want any part of this beastly invention. Get rid of it! Scuttle it! The sooner the better.

MYCROFT: May I point out, Ma'am
QUEEN VICTORIA: And don't concern yourself about that dirigible dropping bombs on us. We shall write a very sharp note to the Kaiser. Now we wish to return to Balmoral.
HOLMES: Well, Mycroft, it seems we have both been undone by a woman. What a shame.
MYCROFT: Not necessarily. If the Germans want that submersible so badly, why don't we give it to them?
HOLMES: Give it to them?
MYCROFT: Invite them aboard for the final journey seven hundred feet straight down.
HOLMES: And how are you going to arrange that?
MYCROFT: I'm rather counting on you to do it. Since you are on such intimate terms with Fraulein von Hoffmanstal.
MYCROFT: Shall we say goodbye to Her Majesty?
HOLMES: Sorry about that. But as long as you're up what is the German word for castle? Schloss, isn't it?
GABRIELLE: ( carefully ) I think so.
HOLMES: And how would you say under the castle? Unter das Schlss? Or die Schloss?
GABRIELLE: I don't know. My German isn't that good.
HOLMES: ( indicating ) Your Trappist friends are out there waiting to hear from you it's a chilly morning we don't want to keep them standing around too long, do we, Fraulein ( Gabrielle looks at him Come now. It's too late to play cat and ( flatly ) Unter dem Schloss.
GABRIELLE: ( flatly ) Unter dem Schloss.
HOLMES: Thank you. Here's your signalling device it's a bit damp, I'm afraid would you care to let them know where they can find the No? Then I'll just have to do it myself. I only hope my Morse code is adequate to the occasion.
HOLMES: can consider your part of the mission accomplished, Fraulein Hoffmanstal.
GABRIELLE: ( glancing toward window ) I suppose once they're in the castle. It must amuse you, Mr. Holmes, Trappists walking into a trap.

HOLMES: castle, they will encounter surprisingly little resistance it will take but a small bottle of chloroform to overcome the guards.
GABRIELLE: ( skeptically ) You mean you're going to let them have the air-pump?
HOLMES: them have the submersible. They will find it with its engines running, all set to go. I assume they're all expert sailors? And since there is a German battleship cruising off the coast of Scotland, I expect they'll try to sail it out of the lock and rendezvous at sea.
GABRIELLE: I would suggest you get your things together. Mycroft will be here to take you into custody. I never had you fooled for a moment, did I? You knew right from the beginning when the cabbie brought me to Baker Let me see not quite that soon.
HOLMES: I would suggest you get your things together. Mycroft will be here to take you into custody. I never had you fooled for a moment, did I? You knew right from the beginning when the cabbie brought me to Baker Let me see not quite that soon.

HOLMES: Let me see not quite that soon.
GABRIELLE: It's so funny. I asked for this assignment, you know. I was scheduled to go to Japan, but I couldn't resist the challenge of coming up against the best. I'm sorry I didn't give you a closer Close enough.
HOLMES: Close enough.
GABRIELLE: You're just being kind. I failed We all have occasional failures. Fortunately, Dr. Watson never writes about mine.
HOLMES: We all have occasional failures. Fortunately, Dr. Watson never writes about mine.
WATSON: Holmes! Holmes!
WATSON: In his haste he trips over the bag, goes down. As he picks himself up again, Gabrielle points toward the EXT. BALCONY - HOTEL - DAY Holmes is leaning against the parapet, scanning the lake through his telescope. Watson appears through the open French window behind him.
WATSON: ( excitedly ) Holmes, I saw it again that thing it came from the castle it's out there
HOLMES: It was out there. Now it's gone.
WATSON: Forever. Look for yourself.
HOLMES: Forever. Look for yourself.
WATSON: A bottle of champagne?. and a Bible?.
HOLMES: That's all that's left of H.M.S. Jonah.
HOLMES: It would seem that somebody carelessly loosened the bolts of the submersible. What a fitting end for Trappists now they are resting in eternal silence at the bottom of the lake.
WATSON: ( to Gabrielle ) Do you know what he's talking about?
MYCROFT: Fraulein von Hoffmanstal?
GABRIELLE: Yes, Mr. Holmes. I'm all ready.
MYCROFT: If there's one thing I like about the Prussians, it's their punctuality.
GABRIELLE: If there's one thing I dislike about the British, it's their climate. I understand your jails are quite damp and your heating facilities totally They are. But you're not going to jail. You're going back to Germany.
MYCROFT: They are. But you're not going to jail. You're going back to Germany.
GABRIELLE: You will be conducted to the Swiss-German border, and be exchanged for one of our agents a man named Ibbetson.
MYCROFT: You will be conducted to the Swiss-German border, and be exchanged for one of our agents a man named Ibbetson.
GABRIELLE: Thank you.
MYCROFT: Don't thank me. Thank my brother. It was his idea.
MYCROFT: ( to Gabrielle ) Frankly, I think we are making a very poor deal. You much better than most operatives working for British ( turning to Holmes ) Don't you agree, Sherlock?
HOLMES: ( with a small but gallant bow And better than some consulting
MYCROFT: ( to Gabrielle ) Shall we?
GABRIELLE: ( reaching for parasol ) I'll take that. ( to Holmes and Watson ) ( folding his arms ) All right, Holmes you don't have to explain anything to me, if you don't want I appreciate that, Watson.
WATSON: ( folding his arms ) All right, Holmes you don't have to explain anything to me, if you don't want I appreciate that, Watson.
HOLMES: I appreciate that, Watson.
WATSON: After all, I'm only your official Anyway, I don't think she'd care to have this story spread all over Strand The public has a right to know these things. If she's a German spy, why should we concern ourselves about her
HOLMES: Anyway, I don't think she'd care to have this story spread all over Strand The public has a right to know these things. If she's a German spy, why should we concern ourselves about her
WATSON: The public has a right to know these things. If she's a German spy, why should we concern ourselves about her
WATSON: If I promised not to write a word about it, would you enlighten me? As your friend as your valet
HOLMES: Quiet. I'm trying to read a personal A message?
WATSON: A message?
WATSON: What is she saying?
HOLMES: ( slowly ) Auf Wiedersehn.
WATSON: Auf Weider-? The nerve!
HOLMES: ( holding up envelope ) H'mmm. A letter from the Diogenes Club.
WATSON: Maybe Mycroft is putting you up for If only to have the distinct pleasure of blackballing his brother.
HOLMES: If only to have the distinct pleasure of blackballing his brother.
WATSON: Aren't you going to finish your Dear Sherlock, von Hoffmanstal was arrested last week by the Japanese counter-intelligence service for spying on naval installations in Yokohama harbour. After a secret trial, she was summarily executed by a firing she had been living in Japan these past few months under the name of Mrs.
WATSON: Holmes I'm terribly sorry about this.
HOLMES: ( quietly, without turning ) Where is it, Watson?
WATSON: ( after a beat ) In the files. May to July, 1885.
HOLMES: You're getting better.
LESTRADE: Good morning, Watson. Just happened to be in the neighborhood, and I thought
WATSON: What is it this time, Inspector Lestrade?
LESTRADE: We've had three rather nasty murders in Whitechapel. All ladies of easy virtue. You may read something about it the newspapers are referring to the killer as Jack the Ripper.
WATSON: Yes, I think I have.
LESTRADE: Some of us at Scotland Yard were wondering if perhaps Mr. Holmes would be willing to
WATSON: ( a glance toward the bedroom ) I'm sorry, Lestrade. But at the moment, Holmes is working on another problem.
LESTRADE: ( trying to hide his Oh. Well, I just thought it was the kind of case that might interest him. I dare say we can solve it without his Oh, I'm sure you will.
WATSON: Oh, I'm sure you will.
WATSON: Good day, Lestrade.
