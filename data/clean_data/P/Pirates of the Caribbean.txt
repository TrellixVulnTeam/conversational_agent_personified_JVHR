ELIZABETH: .drink up me hearties, yo, ho.
GIBBS: ( sotto ) Quiet, missy! Cursed pirates sail these waters. You want to call 'em down on us?
NORRINGTON: Mr. Gibbs. That will do.
GIBBS: She was singing about pirates. Bad luck to sing about pirates, with us mired in this unnatural fog mark my words.
NORRINGTON: Consider them marked. On your 'Aye, Captain. Bad luck to have a woman on board, too. Even a mini'ture one.
GIBBS: 'Aye, Captain. Bad luck to have a woman on board, too. Even a mini'ture one.
ELIZABETH: I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
NORRINGTON: Think again, Miss Swan. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirates brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
SWAN: Captain Norrington. I appreciate your fervor, but I am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter.
NORRINGTON: My apologies, Governor.
ELIZABETH: Actually, I find it all fascinating.
SWAN: And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, dear. we will be landing in Port Royal very soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
ELIZABETH: Yes, father.
NORRINGTON: Man overboard!
ELIZABETH: Boy overboard!
NORRINGTON: Fetch a hook! Haul him out of
SWAN: Where did he come from?
GIBBS: Mary mother of God .
SWAN: What happened here?
NORRINGTON: An explosion in the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed.
GIBBS: Lot of good it did them. Everyone's thinking it! I'm just saying it! Pirates!
SWAN: There is no proof of that. It could have been an accident. Captain, these men were protection. If there is even the slightest chance one of those poor devils is still alive, we cannot abandon them!
NORRINGTON: Of course not, Governor. Come about and strike the sails! Unlash the boats! Gunnery crew. jackets off the cannons! Hope for the best.prepare for the worst. Move the boy aft. We'll need the deck clear.
SWAN: Elizabeth, I want you to accompany the boy. He's in your charge now. You'll watch over him?
ELIZABETH: My name is Elizabeth Swann.
WILL: Will Turner.
ELIZABETH: I'm watching over you, Will.
NORRINGTON: Did he speak?
ELIZABETH: His name is Will Turner that's all I found out.
NORRINGTON: Very good.
ELIZABETH: Yes yes.
SWANN: Still abed at this hour? It's a beautiful day! I have a gift for you.
ELIZABETH: It's beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion?
SWANN: Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
SWANN: Captain Norrington's promotion
ELIZABETH: I knew it.
SWANN: Or, rather, Commodore Norrington.a fine gentleman, don't you think? He fancies you, you know.
ELIZABETH: Difficult . to say.
ELIZABETH: ( holding her breath ) Women in London must have learned to not breath.
BUTLER: Governor? A caller is here for
SWANN: Ah, Mr. Turner! It's good to see you again!
WILL: Good day, sir. I have your order. The blade is folded steel. That's gold filigree laid into the handle. If I may -
SWANN: Impressive. .. very impressive. Commodore Norrington will be pleased, I'm sure. Do pass my compliments on to your master.
WILL: ( bows slightly ) I shall. A craftsman is always pleased to hear his work is appreciated
SWANN: Elizabeth! You look stunning!
ELIZABETH: Will! It's so good to see you!
SWANN: Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate -
ELIZABETH: ( ignores her father ) About the day we met. Do you I could never forget it, Miss Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
WILL: I could never forget it, Miss Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
ELIZABETH: Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
WILL: At least once more, Miss Swann. As Well said! There's a boy who understands propriety. Now, we must be
SWANN: Well said! There's a boy who understands propriety. Now, we must be
ELIZABETH: Good day, Mr. Turner.
WILL: Good day.
SWANN: Dear, I do hope you demonstrate a bit more decorum in front of Commodore Norrington. After all, it is only
HARBORMASTER: If you're out rolling scuppers in this tub, you're either incredibly brave or incredibly stupid.
JACK: It's remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
HARBORMASTER: It's a shilling for the dock space, and you're going to have to give me your name.
JACK: What do you say to three shillings, and we forget the name?
HARBORMASTER: Welcome to Port Royal, Mr. Smith.
MURTOGG: This dock is off-limits to Sorry, I didn't know.
JACK: Sorry, I didn't know.
MURTOGG: No . someone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to This must be some important boat.
JACK: This must be some important boat.
MULLROY: Captain Norrington's made it his flagship. He'll use it to hunt down the last dregs of piracy on the Spanish Lake.
JACK: Captain Norrington's made it his flagship. He'll use it to hunt down the last dregs of piracy on the Spanish Lake.
MURTOGG: Captain Norrington's made it his flagship. He'll use it to hunt down the last dregs of piracy on the Spanish Lake.
MULLROY: Right. Commodore Norrington.
MURTOGG: Right. Commodore Norrington.
JACK: That's a fine goal, I'm sure . But it seems to me a ship like that makes this one here just a wee Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
MURTOGG: Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
JACK: That so? I've heard of one, supposed to be fast, nigh uncatchable . the Black
MULLR0Y: There's no real ship as can match the Interceptor.
MURTOGG: The Black Pearl is a real ship.
MULLROY: No, it's not.
MURTOGG: Yes it is. I've seen it.
MULLR0Y: You've seen it?
MURTOGG: You've seen the Black Pearl?
MULLROY: You've seen the Black Pearl?
MURTOGG: You haven't seen it.
MULLR0Y: You haven't seen it.
MURTOGG: Yes, I have.
MULLR0Y: You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
MURTOGG: . No .
MULLROY: But I've seen a ship with black sails.
MURTOGG: But I've seen a ship with black sails.
MULLR0Y: Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl. Is that what you're saying?
MURTOGG: . no.
MULLR0Y: ( turns back to Jack ) Like I said, there's no real ship as can match Hey!
JACK: I'm sorry. It's just such a pretty boat. Ship.
MURTOGG: What's your name?
JACK: What's your business in Port Royal, 'Mr. Smith' ?
MULLR0Y: What's your business in Port Royal, 'Mr. Smith' ?
MURTOGG: And no lies!
JACK: None? Very well. You've rumbled me. I confess: I intend to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go out on the account, do a little honest pirating.
MURTOGG: I said, no lies.
MULLR0Y: I think he's telling the truth.
MURTOGG: He's not telling the truth.
MULLROY: He may be.
MURTOGG: If he were telling the truth he wouldn't have told us.
JACK: Unless, of course, he knew you wouldn't believe the truth if he told it to you.
NORRINGTON: May I have a moment?
ELIZABETH: I can't breathe.
NORRINGTON: ( smiles )
NORRINGTON ELIZABETH!: He leaps to the top of the parapet, prepared to dive a lieutenant, GILLETTE catches his arm.
GILLETTE: The rocks, sir! It's a miracle she missed them!
JACK: Aren't you going to save her?
MULLR0Y: I can't swim.
JACK: ( rolls his eyes )
MULLROY: Not breathing.
JACK: He pushes past Mullroy, kneels over Elizabeth, raises the knife Murtogg is shocked - Jack slits the corset down the middle, yanks it away. Elizabeth remains still. And then she coughs up water and gasps, choking on her first full breath. Jack is Jack flips the knife and hands it hilt-first to Murtogg - and that's when he spots - The MEDALLION. Jack catches it up in his "hand.
MULLROY: I never would have thought of Clearly, you've never been to
JACK: Clearly, you've never been to
NORRINGTON: On your feet.
SWANN: Elizabeth! Are you all right?
ELIZABETH: Yes yes, I'm fine Commodore Norrington, do you intend to kill my rescuer?
NORRINGTON: I believe thanks are in order.
JACK: Captain Jack Sparrow. If you please.
NORRINGTON: I don't see your ship Captain.
MURTOGG: He said he'd come to commandeer one.
MULLROY: ( to Murtogg ) I told you he was telling the truth. ( currying favor ) These are his, sir.
NORRINGTON: ( to Jack ) Extra powder, but no additional shot.
JACK: Ah, but you have heard of me.
NORRINGTON: Carefully, lieutenant.
ELIZABETH: Commodore, I must protest. Pirate or not, this man saved my life.
NORRINGTON: One good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness.
JACK: But it seems to be enough to condemn
NORRINGTON: ( smiles )
JACK: Lightning-quick, he snaps the corset around the hand and wrist of the man holding the pistol and yanks. The pistol sails into the water. Before anyone can react to that, Jack has the manacle chain wrapped around Elizabeth's throat. Pistols are drawn again, but now Elizabeth serves as a shield. Norrington raises a cautioning hand to his men.
JACK: Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?
ELIZABETH: ( as she works ) You are despicable.
JACK: I saved your life; now you've saved mine. We're square.
NORRINGTON: On his heels! Gillette, bring a squad down from the fort!
ELIZABETH: Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine! Go capture him.
SWANN: Here, dear . you should wear this.
ELIZABETH: Thank you, Father . and let that be the last of your fashion advice, please.
WILL: Right where I left you.
JACK: You look familiar . Have I ever threatened you before?
WILL: I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
JACK: Ah. Then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record. So if you'll excuse me .
WILL: You threatened Miss Swann.
JACK: Only a little.
WILL: I do. And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
JACK: You need to find yourself a girl. Or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you've found one but can't get her? No. I practice three hours a day so that when I meet a pirate . I can kill him.
WILL: No. I practice three hours a day so that when I meet a pirate . I can kill him.
JACK: ( smiles; what do you expect? ) Move away.
WILL: No. I can not just step aside and let you escape.
JACK: No. I can not just step aside and let you escape.
WILL: No. I can not just step aside and let you escape.
JACK: You're lucky, boy this shot's not meant for you.
NORRINGTON: Excellent work, Mister Brown. You've aided in the capture of a dangerous fugitive.
BROWN: Just doing my civic duty.
NORRINGTON: I believe you will always remember this as the day Captain Jack Sparrow almost escaped.
BROWN: That ratter broke my bottle.
ELIZABETH: Nice and toasty. Thank you,
PRISONER: Come here, boy. Want a nice, juicy bone?
JACK: You can keep doing that forever, that dog's never going to move.
PRISONER: Excuse us if we ain't resigned ourselves to the gallows just yet.
SWANN: Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
NORRINGTON: No. She hasn't.
SWANN: Well, she had a taxing day. Ghastly weather tonight.
NORRINGTON: Bleak. Very bleak.
SWANN: What was that?
NORRINGTON: Cannon fire!
JACK: I know those guns!
PRISONER: ( frightened ) The Black Pearl? I've heard stories . she's been preying on ships and settlements for near ten years . and never leaves any There are a lot of stories about the Black Pearl.
JACK: There are a lot of stories about the Black Pearl.
NORRINGTON: Governor! Barricade yourself in my That's an order!
PINTEL: Up there!
ESTRELLA: Miss Elizabeth?
ELIZABETH: Listen, Estrella they haven't seen you. Hide, and first chance, run for the fort .
PINTEL: We know you're here, poppet. Come out and we promise we won't hurt
ELIZABETH: Please, no .
PINTEL: Parlay! I invoke the right of parlay! According to" the Code of the Brethren, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!
ELIZABETH: Parlay! I invoke the right of parlay! According to" the Code of the Brethren, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!
PINTEL: I know the code.
ELIZABETH: If an adversary demands parley, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
PINTEL: It would appear, so do you.
SMOLDERING PIRATE: To blazes with the code!
PINTEL: She wants to be taken to the Captain, and she'll go without a
PRISIONER: Praise be!
JACK: It's all right, doggie . come
TWIGG: This isn't the armory.
KOEHLER: ( Dutch accent ) Well, well. Look what we have here, Twigg. It's. Captain Huh. Last time I saw you, you were all alone on a God-forsaken island, shrinking into the distance. I'd heard you'd gotten off, but I didn't believe it.
TWIGG: Huh. Last time I saw you, you were all alone on a God-forsaken island, shrinking into the distance. I'd heard you'd gotten off, but I didn't believe it.
KOEHLER: Did you sprout little wings and His fortunes aren't improved much.
TWIGG: His fortunes aren't improved much.
JACK: Worry about your own fortunes. The lowest circle of hell is reserved for betrayers . and mutineers.
KOEHLER: You know nothing of hell.
BOSUN: I didn't know we was taking She's invoked the right of parlay. with Captain Barbossa.
PINTEL: She's invoked the right of parlay. with Captain Barbossa.
ELIZABETH: I am here to
BOSUN: You'll speak when spoken to!
BARBOSSA: And you'll not lay a hand on those under the protection of parlay!
BOSUN: Aye, sir.
BARBOSSA: My apologies, miss. As you were saying, before you were so rudely Captain Barbossa . I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.
ELIZABETH: Captain Barbossa . I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.
BARBOSSA: There was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates. What is it you I want you to leave. And never come back.
ELIZABETH: I want you to leave. And never come back.
BARBOSSA: I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request. Means' No. '
ELIZABETH: Very well. I'll drop it!
BARBOSSA: My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me . Why?
ELIZABETH: Because it's what you're searching for. You've been searching for it for years. I recognize this ship.
BARBOSSA: ( interested ) Did you, now?
ELIZABETH: Fine. I suppose if this is worthless, there's no reason to keep it.
BARBOSSA: She catches it by the chain, smiles at him triumphantly.
NO!: She catches it by the chain, smiles at him triumphantly.
ELIZABETH: Elizabeth - I'm a maid in the governor's Barbossa reacts to the name Turner: it confirms what he has suspected. The other pirates surreptitiously exchange glances and nods.
BARBOSSA: You've got sand, for a maid.
ELIZABETH: ( curtsies again ) Thank you, sir.
BARBOSSA: And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that? A family heirloom, perhaps?
ELIZABETH: Of course. I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.
BARBOSSA: No, no, nothing like that. Very well. You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
ELIZABETH: Can I trust you?
BARBOSSA: It's you who invoked the parlay! Believe me, Miss, you'd best hand it over, now. or these be the last friendly words you'll hear! Our bargain. . ?
ELIZABETH: Our bargain. . ?
BOSUN: Still the guns, and stow 'em! Signal the men, set the flags, and make good to clear port!
ELIZABETH: Wait! You must return me to shore! According to the rules of the Order of the Brethren -
BARBOSSA: First. Your return to shore was not part of our negotiations nor our agreement, and so I 'must' do nothing. Secondly: you must be a pirate for the pirate's code to apply. And you're not. And
WILL: Miss Swann! Elizabeth!
WILL: They've taken her! They've taken We're aware of the situation.
NORRINGTON: We're aware of the situation.
WILL: We have to hunt them down and save her!
SWANN: Where do you propose we start? If you have any information that concerns my daughter, then share it! If anyone does, tell me! Leave, Mr. Turner.
MURTOGG: That Jack Sparrow. he talked about the Black Pearl.
MULLROY: Mentioned it, is more what he did.
MURTOGG: We can ask him where it is maybe he can lead us to it!
WILL: We can ask him where it is maybe he can lead us to it!
SWANN: That pirate tried to kill my daughter. We could never trust a word he said!
WILL: We could strike a bargain -
NORRINGTON: No. The pirates who invaded this fort left Sparrow locked in his cell. Ergo, he is not their ally, and therefore of no value. We will determine their most likely course, and launch a search mission that sails with the tide.
WILL: That's not good enough. This is Elizabeth's life!
NORRINGTON: Mr. Turner, this is not the time for rash actions. Do not make the mistake of thinking you are the only man here who loves Elizabeth. Now, go home.
WILL: Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
JACK: Where does it make berth?
WILL: Where does it make berth?
JACK: Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta. an island that cannot be found except by those who already know where it is.
WILL: The ship's real enough. So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?
JACK: Why ask me?
WILL: Because you're a pirate.
JACK: And you want to turn pirate They took Miss Swann.
WILL: ( beat ) They took Miss Swann.
JACK: ( he was right ) So it is that you found a girl. Well, if you're intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone. I see no profit in it for me.
WILL: I can get you out of here.
JACK: How? The key's run off.
WILL: ( examines the cell ) I helped build these cells. Those are hook-and-ring hinges. The proper application of strength, the door'll lift free. Just calls for the right lever and fulcrum. . .
JACK: Your name is Turner.
WILL: Yes. Will Turner.
JACK: Will Turner. I'll tell you what, Mr. Turner. I've changed my mind. You spring me from this cell, and on pain of death, I'll you to the Black Pearl. Do we have an accord?
WILL: chair his fulcrum, and levers the long bench under the door. Pushes down it's hard work but the cell door rises, and then falls forward, CRASHING down on the bench and chair. Jack is impressed. He steps out of the cell.
JACK: chair his fulcrum, and levers the long bench under the door. Pushes down it's hard work but the cell door rises, and then falls forward, CRASHING down on the bench and chair. Jack is impressed. He steps out of the cell.
WILL: Someone will have heard that.
JACK: Not without my effects.
WILL: We need to go!
JACK: My business, Will. As for your business -one question, or there's no use going. This girl what does she mean to you? How far are you willing to go to save I'd die for her.
WILL: ( no hesitation ) I'd die for her.
JACK: EXT. PORT ROYAL - DOCKS - MORNING The Jolly Mon, four inches of water in the bottom, squats low in the water, heeled to one side, creaking on its
WILL: I haven't set foot off dry land I was twelve, when the ship I was on It's been a sound policy.
JACK: No worries there. She's far more likely to rot out from under us.
WILL: We're going to steal a ship? That Commandeer. We're going to commandeer a ship. Nautical term.
JACK: Commandeer. We're going to commandeer a ship. Nautical term.
WILL: It's still against the law.
JACK: So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring My advice smile and enjoy it.
WILL: This is either crazy, or Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
JACK: Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
JACK: Everybody stay calm. We're taking over the ship!
WILL: ( a beat ) Aye! Avast!
GILLETTE: You're serious about this.
JACK: Dead serious.
GILLETTE: You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men. You'll never make it out of the bay.
JACK: We'll see about that.
GILLETTE: Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise.
JACK: Fine by me. We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
GILLETTE: ( a curt nod ) Agreed. You have the momentary advantage, sir. But I will see you smile from the yard arm sir.
JACK: As likely as not. Will, short up the anchor, we've got ourselves a ship!
JACK: A little help?
MURTOGG: I can't believe he's doing this.
MULLROY: You didn't believe he was telling the truth, either.
GILLETTE: ( over his shoulder, to Will ) Do you have any idea, boy, what you're
WILL: EXT. DAUNTLESS - FORECASTLE - DAY Jack and Will crank a capstan, raising the forward jib sail. It luffs and billows out. The huge ship inches forward slowly, pulled by just the one sail. Jack grins.
JACK: Lookee there, mate! We're
SWANN: A moment.
NORRINGTON: A moment.
SWANN: Dammit, man, it appears someone is stealing your ship!
NORRINGTON: Dammit, man, it appears someone is stealing your ship!
SWANN: Dammit, man, it appears someone is stealing your ship!
NORRINGTON: Rash, Turner, too rash.
WILL: They're coming!
NORRINGTON: Search every cabin, every hold, down to the bilges!
JACK: Can you swim? Can. You. Swim?
SENTRY: Of course, sir. Like a fish. I grew up summers living in Dover, with my uncle -
JACK: Jack lifts the man up, throws him overboard. Quickly unties the ropes to the grappling hooks. Will cranks the capstan bars, raising the foresail -
NORRINGTON: Sailors! Back to the Interceptor!
JACK: Thank you, Commodore, for getting our ship ready to make way! We'd've had a hard time of it by ourselves!
NORRINGTON: Raise the sails.
GILLETTE: The wind is quarter from astern . by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
NORRINGTON: We need only to come about, to put them in range of the long nines.
GILLETTE: Hands! Come about! Jackets off the We are to fire on our own ship?
NORRINGTON: Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
STEERSMAN: Captain, there's a problem.
NORRINGTON: So it would seem.
GILLETTE: He's got to be the best pirate I've ever seen.
NORRINGTON: So it would seem.
PINTEL: You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this.
ELIZABETH: Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
PINTEL: ( happy ) He said you say that! He also said if that be the case, you'll be dining with the crew, and you'll be naked.
BARBOSSA: Maid or not, it fits you.
ELIZABETH: Dare I ask the fate of its previous Now, none of that. Please dig in.
BARBOSSA: Now, none of that. Please dig in.
ELIZABETH: It's poisoned!
BARBOSSA: Oh, there would be no sense in killing you, Miss Turner.
ELIZABETH: Then why aren't you eating?
BARBOSSA: Would that I could.
ELIZABETH: It's a pirate medallion.
BARBOSSA: It's a piece of the treasure of Isla de Muerta . Ah, so you don't know as much as you pretend. Back when Cortes was cutting a great bloody swath through the New World, a high priest gave. him all the gold they had, with one condition: that he spare the people's lives. Of course, Cortes being Cortes, he didn't. He'd've made a great pirate, that one.
ELIZABETH: That's all very interesting, but I hardly believe in ghost stories any more. You idiot girl! It's no make- believe! My crew and I, we found the gold, and we did more than take one piece, we took it all. Rich men we were and we spent it and traded it and gave it away in There is but one way to remove the curse. All of the scattered pieces of the treasure must be restored in full, and the blood repaid.

BARBOSSA: ( shakes her ) LOOK! The moonlight shows us for what we really are! We are not among the living and so we cannot die -
JACK: For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick I worked passage from England as a cabin boy. After my mother passed, I came out here . looking for my father.
WILL: I worked passage from England as a cabin boy. After my mother passed, I came out here . looking for my father.
JACK: Is that so?
WILL: My father. William Turner?
JACK: I knew him. Probably one of the few who knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.
WILL: Good man. Good pirate. And clever -"- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his That's not true.
JACK: Good man. Good pirate. And clever -"- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his That's not true.
WILL: ( angry ) That's not true.
JACK: I swear, you look just like him.
WILL: It's not true that my father was a Figured you wouldn't want to hear He was a merchant marine! He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules
JACK: Figured you wouldn't want to hear He was a merchant marine! He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules
WILL: He was a merchant marine! He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules
JACK: ( laughs ) You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable
WILL: My father did not think of my mother -his family as a burden.
JACK: Sure because he could always go My father was not a pirate!
WILL: My father was not a pirate!
JACK: Put it away, Will. It's not worth getting beat again.
WILL: You didn't beat me. You ignored the rules of engagement. In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
JACK: Then that's not much incentive for me to fight fair, is it? As long as you're just hanging there, pay attention. Must, Should, do, don't, shall, shall not those are just suggestions. There are only two absolute rules.
WILL: Oh did I forget to mention
JACK: Oh did I forget to mention
JACK: We need a crew. We can manage the ship between islands, but the open sea, that's another matter -
WILL: Just do it quickly.
JACK: ( rubbing his jaw ) Don't worry. I've already got my Quartermaster there!
ANAMARIA: You stole my boat.
JACK: AnaMaria! Have you seen Gibbs? I need to put together -
ANAMARIA: My dory. The Jolly Mon. Where is Safe! At Port Royal. With the Royal Navy.
JACK: Safe! At Port Royal. With the Royal Navy.
ANAMARIA: That boat is my livelihood!
JACK: You'll get it back. Or one better.
ANAMARIA: ( a threat ) I will.
SLAP!: Jack! Over here!
WILL: Jack! Over here!
GIBBS: Curse you for breathing, you slack-jawed idiot Mother's love, Jack, you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping. It's bad luck!
JACK: Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it. The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.
GIBBS: Aye, that'll about do it.
WILL: I know. That was for the smell.
JACK: Just the one.
GIBBS: Make it_ast, then. Now, what's the nature of this venture of yours?
JACK: First have you found me a crew?
GIBBS: Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you seem to think you're a jinx.
JACK: Now where, I wonder, would they have gotten that idea?
GIBBS: Say again?
JACK: Ilm going after the Black Pearl. I know where its going to be, and I'm going to take it.
GIBBS: Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl.
JACK: Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to. All I need is a A fool's errand.
GIBBS: ( shakes his head ) A fool's errand.
JACK: Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants. Something he And you've got that, have you?
GIBBS: And you've got that, have you?
JACK: Back there, guarding the door is the son of old Bootstrap Bill
GIBBS: Well, lookee there. I'll allow you may be onto something, Jack. There's bound to be sailors on this rock crazy as you. I'll find some men. Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?
JACK: That he is.
GIBBS: Feast your eyes, Cap'n. All of 'em good sea-faring men, faithful hands before the mast, every one worth his and crazy, to boot.
ANAMARIA: You owe me a boat.
GIBBS: Cotton here is mute, sir. Poor devil had his tongue cut out
JACK: Mr. Cotton. Do you have the courage and fortitude to follow orders and stay true, in the face danger, and almost certain death?
COTTON'S PARROT: Wind in your SAILS! Wind in your SAILS!
GIBBS: Mostly, that seem to mean 'yes.'
JACK: That goes for the rest of you! Danger and near certain death. For we are to sail for the Isla de Muerta, to rescue the daughter of Governor Swann. An equal share of the reward shall be -
WILL: Shut up, before you lose them all!
JACK: These are the only ones worth And we're going to need them-
GIBBS: That fool will have us lose the canvas, and the masts besides!
JACK: She can hold a bit longer.
GIBBS: ( shouts ) What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?
JACK: ( shouts ) We're catching up!
TWIGG: Isla de Muerta! Isla de Muerta, off the port bow!
JACOBY: Orders, Captain?
BARBOSSA: Bring her in, not too close. I won't brave the reef, not until high tide. We lay anchor before dark.
JACK: Bear three points starboard.
GIBBS: Left handed-ropes are coiled against the sun, or it's bad luck!
WILL: How do we expect to find an island no one can find with a compass that doesn't work?
GIBBS: Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work. That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lie.
WILL: ( moves closer ) So . what's the story on the
GIBBS: I'll tell lee. Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts. This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl -
WILL: What? He never told me that.
GIBBS: Ah he's learned, then. Plays things more close to the vest. See, Jack was a cartographer, back in Old England. Somehow I he came by the money to commission the Pearl. Hired himself a crew, promised each man an equal share. So, they're forty days out, and the First Mate says, everything's an equal share, that should mean the location of the island, too. So Jack gave up the That night, there was mutiny.
WILL: How did he get off the island?
JACK: ( loud ) I didn't!
GIBBS: How did you get off the island?
JACK: Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold.
WILL: Wait what about the pistol?
JACK: The pistol. When a pirate is marooned, Will, he's given a pistol with a single shot. No good for hunting, or surviving, really. But after three weeks of starvation and thirst the option of that pistol begins to look
WILL: Jack shoots a glance at Will nods, and moves away.
KOEHLER: Moonrise, Captain! First night of full.
BARBOSSA: ( to the pirates ) Be mindful of pits and crevasses. Stay together.
BARBOSSA: Careful, mate. Fall down there, you'd die and miss Judgement Day for not even the Lord himself'll come look for you here.
COTTON'S PARROT: Land HO! Land HO! LAND ho! LAND How does he do that?
ANAMARIA: How does he do that?
JACK: They'll be anchored on the lee side. Haul your wind, and keep to the weather of the island -
ELIZABETH: The curse drove you to gather Aye. And not a bit of it any use to us, only hoarded. But it will drive us no longer.
WILL: What's that?
JACK: On what?
WILL: On what?
JACK: On whether the stories are all true. If they are, that's a waterfall that spills over at high tide, with a short drop to an underground lagoon. If not -
JACK: Chalk one up for the stories.
BARBOSSA: Here we stand before the cursed treasure of Cortez himself. Won by blood, it demands blood in return.
PINTEL: What did you expect? We're all gentlemen here, right and proper. You know the first thing I'm going to do after the curse is lifted? Eat a whole bushel of apples. What was begun by blood, let blood now end! Did it work?
BARBOSSA: You know the first thing I'm going to do after the curse is lifted? Eat a whole bushel of apples. What was begun by blood, let blood now end! Did it work?
KOEHLER: Did it work?
DEADEYE: I don't feel no different.
JACOBY: How do we tell?
KOEHLER: You're not dead.
JACOBY: ( realizes ) He shot me!
TWIGG: It didn't work! The curse is still upon us! You. Maid. Your father. What was his name?! Was your father William Turner?!
BARBOSSA: You. Maid. Your father. What was his name?! Was your father William Turner?!
ELIZABETH: The pirates cry out in alarm. Barbossa gathers himself, getting his rage under steely control.
BARBOSSA: Where's his child? The child that sailed from England eight years ago, the child who is the real owner of that medallion, the child in whose veins flows the blood of William Turner?! Where? You brought us the wrong person!
JACOBY: ( to Pintel ) You brought us the wrong person!
PINTEL: She had the medallion! She's the right age. She said her name was You brought us here for nothing?
TWIGG: ( to Barbossa ) You brought us here for nothing?
BARBOSSA: If you had sailed with Morgan for ten years like I have, you'd know not to question me!
ELIZABETH: You're in league with Barbossa!
JACK: You're in league with Barbossa!
ELIZABETH: You're in league with Barbossa!
JACK: No, I'm rescuing you.
ELIZABETH: Will gains his footing in the rubble.
WILL: Miss Swann! We're here to rescue It's going badly!
JACK: This way!
WILL: I'm glad we got here in time.
ELIZABETH: Truthfully you were a bit late.
JACK: The trick isn't getting here, it's getting away.
ELIZABETH: Come on!
JACK: No. This won't work. I'll stay behind, and fight them. You go on.
WILL: I'll lead them away.
JACK: I'll lead them away.
WILL: Are you sure? Jack this is not something you have to do.
JACK: I'm sure. When you've led the kind of life I have, there are debts that must be paid. Maybe I can balance the scales a little.
BARBOSSA: I'm inclined to kill you now, Jack Sparrow, without so much as a word, if you don't lose that grin from your face.
JACK: The woman's blood didn't work, did
BARBOSSA: Say the name, or I slit your No you won't.
JACK: No you won't.
PINTEL: BARBOSSA ( NODS ) ( Pintel grins )
JACK: Simple. I have something you want more than anything. The way to free you from the curse of the treasure. You have something I want more than anything.
BARBOSSA: The Pearl? Oh, that's fine. And just how do you expect this to work?
JACK: You give me the Pearl. Then I tell you who you need.
BARBOSSA: That's your offer? You, sailing away nice and pretty with the Black Pearl, and all I have is a That's right.
JACK: That's right.
BARBOSSA: I'm supposed to . trust you?
JACK: I'm a man of my word.
BARBOSSA: I'll torture it out of you.
JACK: You left me on a desert island what worse can you do?
BARBOSSA: Blast you! I'll throw you in Wait as long as you like.
JACK: Wait as long as you like.
BARBOSSA: You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
JACK: Let's say I tell you the wrong person. What would you do?
BARBOSSA: Track you down and -
JACK: And if I tell you the truth, you become mortal, and you won't come near me because you know I'd kill you.
BARBOSSA: Jack, I don't trust you, and that's a fact. Never trust a smiling man, you can lay to that.
JACK: See, that's where we're different. I trust you . to do what it takes to get what you want.
BARBOSSA: You're playing this as close to the edge as any man, I'll give you
JACK: What you don't have the medallion?
BARBOSSA: That fool woman took it. You be careful around her, Jack she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart but pure evil inside.
JACK: I'll watch my back.
BARBOSSA: Bosun! Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters, nice and fine . in the brig. Meaning no disrespect, of course.
GIBBS: Two women on board? A man don't have to be superstitious to know that's
ELIZABETH: . you were in danger . so I took the medallion. And I've kept it ever since. They thought I was you, that they needed my blood. And it didn't
WILL: Why would my father send this to me?
ELIZABETH: To keep it away from them? No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.
WILL: If I had known-
ELIZABETH: ( anticipating him ) then we never would have met.
WILL: I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us.
ELIZABETH: I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.
GIBBS: Shift your heading, steer clear of that island. Fifteen degrees starboard.
COTTON'S PARROT: Dead men tell NO tales! Dead men tell NO tales! Dead men tell NO tales!
ANAMARIA: Can we outrun them?
GIBBS: Not a chance. Make for the reef.
PINTEL: What's he doing? Is he going to run her aground?
GIBBS: Drop the forward anchor!
BARBOSSA: All hands! Prepare to come about!
JACK: Don't hit my ship! I mean, kill the lying scoundrel - I'm a little conflicted, here.
BARBOSSA: Strike your colors, you bloody Looks like they mean to send us under.
ANAMARIA: Looks like they mean to send us under.
GIBBS: There she's raised the Jolly Roger, It's a signal. If we resist, it won't just be death. There'll be torture as We're not going to just surrender!
WILL: We're not going to just surrender!
WILL: We can at least fight we might be able to kill a few-
GIBBS: Will it'll go worse for us for Elizabeth, especially if we fight.
BARBOSSA: Welcome back, Miss. Last time on board, you played me right clever, make pretending and all. I hope your stay this time is more pleasant. Boys, show her some hospitality!
WILL: She goes free!
BARBOSSA: What's in your head, boy?
WILL: She. Goes. Free.
BARBOSSA: You've got one shot and we can't You can't. I can.
WILL: You can't. I can.
ELIZABETH: Jack pushes forward.
JACK: Will don't do anything stupid! Don't say anything stupid -
WILL: My name is Will Turner, the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner. His blood runs in my veins. You need my blood. And on my word I will pull this trigger, and sink all the way down to Davy Jones' Locker!
TWIGG: It's true - he's the spittin' image of old Bootstrap. Even talks the same!
BARBOSSA: Looks like you're back to having nothing to offer.
PINTEL: And hers got Old Bill's courage. A curse on him, and you!
BARBOSSA: Enough of that! Name your terms.
WILL: Elizabeth goes free!
BARBOSSA: We got that part. Anything else?
WILL: And Jack. And the crew. Free and unharmed. I f you agree. then. I will remain with you.
BARBOSSA: Agreed. You have my word, as a gentleman of fortune -
ELIZABETH: Will you can't trust him.
WILL: You must swear by the Holy Bible.
BARBOSSA: Eh? You have my word, then on the Good Book, I do swear, and the Lord spare my worthless soul.
GIBBS: ( dejected ) Amen to that.
BARBOSSA: Jack, Elizabeth . I'm a man of my word and you're to be set free, right Men, break out the plank!
WILL: No! You gave your word!
BARBOSSA: Quiet, boy, or you'll lose your tongue. Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the I agreed to set them free. I didn't say when. .. nor where.
JACK: It's pure evil to make a Captain walk the plank of his own ship, twice in one lifetime. No good can come of it.
BARBOSSA: Now, Jack. That reef is less than a league distant. It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better.
JACK: Someone needs to cut these bonds, then.
BARBOSSA: You'd best take a swim, Jack.
JACK: The last time you did this, you left me a pistol, with one shot.
PINTEL: That's proper, sir, according to the By the Powers, you're right! Where's Jack's pistol? Who's got it? Bring it forward!
BARBOSSA: By the Powers, you're right! Where's Jack's pistol? Who's got it? Bring it forward!
JACK: A gentleman might give us two pistols, seeing as there are two of us, this
BARBOSSA: Tell you what. I'll give you one pistol, and let you be the gentleman, an' shoot the lady, and starve to death That is, presuming you're not both drownded.
JACK: You can go to your grave not knowing.
BARBOSSA: That's fair.
ELIZABETH: Here it will go well with your black heart !
BARBOSSA: Have at her, lads!
ELIZABETH: You went back for that? We need to head for the reef!
JACK: That's the second time I've had to watch that man sail away with my ship.
ELIZABETH: Has it changed since the last time you were here?
JACK: The trees are taller.
ELIZABETH: I hope you have no intention of using
JACK: Not yet. Ask me again in a few weeks.
ELIZABETH: Captain Sparrow! We have to get off this island immediately!
JACK: Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
ELIZABETH: What is that? Is there a boat under there?
JACK: It won't. It won't, and so we
ELIZABETH: But . you did it before! Last time -
JACK: Last time, I was here a grand total of three days. Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off.
ELIZABETH: So that's it? That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous
JACK: Welcome to the Caribbean, love.
ELIZABETH: A month? Will doesn't have a month! We've got to do something to help him!
JACK: You're right. Here's luck to you, Will Turner.
ELIZABETH: Not when you can drink instead, at
JACK: Try it. It goes down rough, but it goes down - - and the second swig goes down easier.
ELIZABETH: And you will call me Miss Swann.
JACK: What? What was that? Something funny, Miss Swann? share. Nothing . it's nothing. Just . I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child. A song about pirates.
ELIZABETH: Nothing . it's nothing. Just . I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child. A song about pirates.
JACK: I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child. Let's hear Oh, no . it's silly. Back in England we didn't know a thing about pirates, really. They seemed so romantic and daring -
ELIZABETH: Oh, no . it's silly. Back in England we didn't know a thing about pirates, really. They seemed so romantic and daring -
JACK: Now I must hear this song. An authentic pirate song. Have at it.
ELIZABETH: Well, perhaps . with a bit more to drink, I might .
JACK: More to drink!
ELIZABETH: We pillage, we plunder, we rifle, we loot, Drink up me hearties, yo
JACK: I LOVE this song! Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me! We're beggars and blighters,
ELIZABETH: You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main.
JACK: Not just the Spanish Main. The whole ocean. .. the whole world. Wherever we want to go, we go. That's what a ship is, you know. Not just a keel and a hull and a deck and sails. That's what a ship need_ . but what a ship is what the Black Pearl really-is . is
ELIZABETH: Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again.
JACK: Ah, well. the company is better than last time. And the scenery has definitely improved.
ELIZABETH: ( coy )
JACK: We've got a few bottles left . and we've yet to tap the kegs.
ELIZABETH: To freedom.
JACK: To the Black Pearl.
JACK: What are you doing? You've burned our food, the shade the rum!
ELIZABETH: Yes, the rum is gone.
JACK: One, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels. Two -
ELIZABETH: One, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels. Two -
JACK: You you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?
ELIZABETH: Elizabeth turns toward the sea.
JACK: They'll be no living with her after this.
NORRINGTON: Elizabeth, I'm" relieved you're Clap him in irons. And behind his back this time.
ELIZABETII: Commodore, you can't do that!
NORRINGTON: You're speaking up for him again?
ELIZABETH: He can locate Isla de Muerta but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.
JACK: ( she's right ) We had time to get to know each other.
NORRINGTON: We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de Muerta.
ELIZABETH: No. The pirates have taken Will -
NORRINGTON: Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home. That is what we shall do. Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable. But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
ELIZABETH: Commodore, please!
JACK: Norrington, think about it . the Black Pearl, its captain and crew. the last pirate threat in the Caribbean. How can you pass that up?
NORRINGTON: By remembering that I serve others, not only myself.
ELIZABETH: Commodore, I beg you please do this . for me. As a wedding I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
NORRINGTON: I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
ELIZABETH: Not as a condition a request.
NORRINGTON: Free Mister Sparrow, and prepare to come about. He'll give you our heading.
JACK: Congratulations, sir.
NORRINGTON: Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my I know now where your heart truly
ELIZABETH: I know now where your heart truly
NORRINGTON: I know now where your heart truly
ELIZABETH: And now I know. where yours does, as well. You may seclude yourself in my cabin. I'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard.
NORRINGTON: You may seclude yourself in my cabin. I'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard.
ELIZABETH: Then I can wear men's clothing.
NORRINGTON: That would hardly be proper.
ELIZABETH: Well, I am not going to stay hidden in a some cabin, 80 I suppose it's going to be heaving bosoms and bare ankles for the remainder of the voyage!
NORRINGTON: Murtogg, take our guest below, and find her some trousers, and a shirt.
PINTEL: That ain't going to work. That's the gun deck above yea
WILL: What happened to William Turner?
PINTEL: Ah, William Turner. Stupid blighter. He threw in with us after we relieved Jack Sparrow of his captaincy, but turned out, it never sat well with him- particularly after we found Cortes' treasure, and its peculiar condition. He thought we deserved to be cursed, for leaving ol' Jack to the fate we did. That's why he sent off a piece of the treasure to you, as it were: so it would never be recovered, and so cursed we_ remain.
WILL: And then he ran. And he's hiding out someplace where you haven't been able to find him.
PINTEL: That's a nice thought, to be sure, and I wager your da wishes he'd thought it hisself. But, no. See, what he'd done, _ didn't sit too well with Captain Barbossa . so he chained a cannon to his legs and dumped him over.
BARBOSSA: Bring him.
ELIZABETH: You didn't tell Commodore Norrington Nor did you, I noticed.
JACK: Nor did you, I noticed.
ELIZABETH: He might delay the rescue . and that would be too late.
JACK: These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.
ELIZABETH: These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.
JACK: I have a plan. If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief . and What's your plan?
ELIZABETH: What's your plan?
LAND HO!: Isla de Muerta lay dark and menacing on the horizon.
NORRINGTON: Elizabeth below decks. I will not compromise your safety..
JACK: Funny, I was thinking along those lines. How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you.
NORRINGTON: You would do that?
JACK: They left me stranded. Twice. What have you got to lose?
NORRINGTON: ( looks at him ) Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid ( smiles ) I knew you'd listen to reason!
JACK: ( smiles ) I knew you'd listen to reason!
JACK: That chart I drew up'11 get you past the reefs. If you're steersman's good enough, that is.
NORRINGTON: I'll be at the wheel myself.
JACK: I'll slip in, talk them into to come out, and you'll be free to blow holy high heaven the whole lot of them.
PINTEL: No reason to fret. It's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood.
BARBOSSA: Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins. Best play it safe, and spill it all.
PINTEL: I guess there is a reason to fret.
BARBOSSA: Careful, now. You could fall in and still be wonder'n when you'll hit dirt.
WILL: You deserve to be cursed and remain cursed!
BARBOSSA: Blast him! A pox on him, and his father, and the whole damnable line! Fan out! Find him!
COTTON'S PARROT: Drink UP me hearties yo ho! Drink UP me hearties yo ho!
JACK: Do you have any idea where you're Don't talk. These caves magnify sound. Just follow me.
WILL: Don't talk. These caves magnify sound. Just follow me.
JACK: Don't talk. These caves magnify sound. Just follow me.
WILL: Are you certain this is the right way?
JACK: It's the right way.
BARBOSSA: Thank you, Jack Sparrow.
WILL: You did know where you were going! You did lead us directly to them!
BARBOSSA: What was begun by blood, let blood now
JACK: You don't want to be doing that.
BARBOSSA: No, I really think I do.
JACK: ( shrugs ) All right then.
BARBOSSA: Why don't I want to do this?
JACK: Because, right about now, the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the - - and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
WILL: - - and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
JACK: - - and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
PINTEL: Do you believe him?
BARBOSSA: ( indicates Will ) But him I believe. He is genuinely You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack . that is, if you're mortal.
JACK: You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack . that is, if you're mortal.
BARBOSSA: What're you suggesting?
JACK: Simple. Don't kill the boy yet. Wait for a more opportune moment.
BARBOSSA: I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn't end 80 well for you.
JACK: The situation has changed.
BARBOSSA: That so?
JACK: Aye. See, after you're done with the Royal Navy, you'll have a bit of a problem: the H.M.S. Dauntless. There you'll be, with two lovely ships on your hands, and what to do? Of course you'll decide you deserve the bigger one, and who's to argue? The Dauntless a first-rate ship-of-line, and with it, you can rule the seas.
BARBOSSA: Men! Are you up for it?
JACK: There's . another exit?
BARBOSSA: Aye, for us there is.
TALL SAILOR: Ship rats. Big ones.
SHORT SAILOR: ( nods ) Hate those things.
TALL SAILOR: That they do.
PINTEL: Be quick, now. Train the starboard guns on the beach, and set your aim. Wait for my signal, we don't want to spook
BONED: Which would you prefer first, good sir -rum, or wine?
SKINNY: Which would you prefer first, good sir -rum, or wine?
GILLETTE: All the men in place, sir. Ready to Wait for my order what the blazes is
NORRINGTON: Wait for my order what the blazes is
WILL: You've been planning this from the beginning. Since you learned my name.
JACK: Oh, please do I really seem that
BARBOSSA: Confound it, Jack I was actually beginning to like you!
NORRINGTON: Steady, men! Remember we're the
GILLETTE: They're on our side! Take heart, men!
BARBOSSA: Just so you know, Jack I don't think you're that clever. I think you're a fool. A mortal fool.
JACK: Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
BARBOSSA: You can't beat me, Jack.
WILL: Jack stares down at the sword jutting from his chest. He takes a few steps backward, toward the Aztec gold when he steps into the moonlight, JACK BECOME SKELETAL.
JACK: Well, isn't that interesting.
BARBOSSA: So what now, Jack Sparrow? Are we to be two immortals, locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgment Day?
JACK: Or you could surrender.
BARBOSSA: Or I could chain you to a cannonball and drop you in the deepest part of the ocean, where you can contemplate your folly
WILL: He didn't waste it.
WILL: Well, you're the worst pirate I've ever heard of. You're a man who can be trusted, who can be counted on, and who can It betray his friends. What kind of pirate is that?
JACK: ( admits it ) The worst. ( beat ) On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean twice! and who knows how to get what he wants. Now that's a great pirate.
WILL: Let's get out of here.
ELIZABETH: You're all right!
WILL: Miss Swann are you wearing trousers? And how did you get off the island?
ELIZABETH: Yes, I am wearing trousers. And as for how we got off the island ah, that's a grand adventure, but now is not the time to talk about it.
WILL: Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter- that we are of a different class -
ELIZABETH: It doesn't!
WILL: but that was not a proper kiss.
JACK: Tough luck. I was rooting for you.
NORRINGTON: .and though I do say so with regret, the law is clear. The penalty for piracy is death by
SWANN: By your leave, I wish to speak on behalf of the boy. It is clear that these deeds were performed out of a sincere desire to do good, at great personal risk. It seems to me, that in the rare occasion where the right course is committing an act of piracy, then an act of piracy is the right course! So in my capacity as Governor, I intend to grant a pardon to
GILLETTE: All eyes turn. Gillette stands at the top of a stairway.
SWANN: The Black Pearl!
GILLETTE: Sir! Shall I break out the I don't think that will be necessary.
NORRINGTON: I don't think that will be necessary.
ANAMARIA: Captain Sparrow the Black Pearl is yours!
JACK: AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!
ANAMARIA: Aye, aye, sir!
JACK: Mr. Gibbs, organize a cleaning detail - you and Cotton. I want every inch of the Pearl spic-and-span and ship-shape!
THE END: FADE OUT and CREDITS ROLL
