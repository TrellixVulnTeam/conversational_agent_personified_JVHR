PLEASANTVILLE: A Fairytale by Gary Ross
COLLEGE COUNSELOR: . For those of you going on to college next year, the chance of finding a good job will actually decrease by the time you graduate. Entry level jobs will drop from thirty-one to twenty-six percent, and the median income for those jobs will go down as well . There is some rustling in the audience.
HEALTH TEACHER: . The chance of contracting HIV from a promiscuous lifestyle will climb to one in one hundred and fifty. The odds of dying in an auto accident are only one in twenty-five hundred. Now this marks a drastic increase .
SCIENCE TEACHER: . From just four years ago when ozone depletion was at ten percent of its current level. By the time you are twenty years old, average global temperature will have risen two and a half degrees. Even a shift of one degree can cause such catastrophic consequences as typhoons, floods, widespread drought and famine.
SCIENCE TEACHER: ( chipper classroom tone ) Okay. Who can tell me what famine is?
BETTY: How was your day?
GEORGE: Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said that if things keep going the way they are, I might be seeing that promotion sooner than I thought.
BETTY: Oh darling that's wonderful! I always knew you could do it.
DAVID: ( by rote ) "It might be ."
DAVID'S MOM: Noyou have custody the first weekend of every month and this is the first weekend . I don't care if yesterday was the thirtieth, this is still the first INT. LIVING ROOM. Her words drift in from the kitchen while David stares at the No I can't bail you out, I'm supposed to go to La Costa . Well if I want to get a mud bath, that's really my business, isn't it? He reaches out and TURNS UP THE SOUND. PLEASANTVILLE plays at an unnaturally high volume.
GEORGE: ( on T.V. ) Hey. Where are those kids?
DAVID: ( recitinga little louder ) "Right behind you father."
MARYSUE: Mother . Father . Bud has a little surprise for you.
BETTY: What's that Bud? Bud hesitates for a moment, then folds up a shiny blue First prize at the science fair. There were lots of swell projectsguess mine was just the "swellest".
BUD: First prize at the science fair. There were lots of swell projectsguess mine was just the "swellest".
BETTY: Darling that's wonderful. Except there's no such word as "swellest".
BUD: Well gee whizz, Mom. lt wasn't the "English" fair. There is another jarring LAUGH TRACK.
DAVID: ( quietly ) What's a mother to do?
DAVID: Hi. I mean . . Hi.

HOWARD: Okay, whose window did Bud break when he was playing with his father's golf Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins have? Howard looks at him, puzzled.

DAVID: They all nodand murmur with admiration.
HOWARD: You're unbelievable. You'll win this thing for sure. When is it on?
DAVID: Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.
HOWARD: ( weighing it ) A thousand dollars . And it's on all Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon.
DAVID: Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon.
KIMMY: Omigod, it's so mortifying, being related to him. I can't believe you're Only on my parent's side.
JENNIFER: Only on my parent's side.
KIMMY: I know, but you're like . twins and You must be from like, the cool side of the uterus. A group of VERY HIP boys strut through the parking lot. They bop up and down with the self-confidence of all cool sixteen year olds. The girls freeze when they see them.
CHRISTIN: Don't do anything. Just don't likedo anything .
JENNIFER: ( cooly ) Hi Mark.
MARK: ( to Jennifer ) ( right back ) Beat .
JENNIFER: ( right back ) Beat .

JENNIFER'S LACKEYS: ( back to them ) Saw you at the mall yesterday.
MARK: Saw you at the mall yesterday.
JENNIFER: Yeah . Saw you too. Everyone nods for a moment or two. No one says anything.
MARK: ( beat ) Jennifer pauses, weighing the next statement.
JENNIFER: My mom'll be out of town. Kimmy and Christin positively GASP while Mark's Lackeys mumble and glance around. The import of the thing isn't lost on anybody. Mark bobs up and down a little faster.
MARK: So uh . Maybe we could uh .
JENNIFER: ( smiling ) ( nodding faster ) Everybody bobs and shuffles for  beat, when Mark nods, summoning his flock.
MARK: ( nodding faster ) Everybody bobs and shuffles for  beat, when Mark nods, summoning his flock.
VARIOUS LACKEYS: Everybody bobs and shuffles for  beat, when Mark nods, summoning his flock.
JENNIFER: It was amazing, Daph . I'm like: "Well my Mom'll be out of town." And he's like "Well then, maybe we could you know ." And I'm like "Yeah, sure." And he's like "Well, cool." I know, he's just so smart. I don't know. Maybe that black thing I just got. It is not slutty, Daph, it's cute. Well, "hello?" He's not coming over here to study . I know. Well I'm jealous of you too INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM. lt is studious and academicnot joyless, but not colorful either. David stands at his bedroom window, staring outside with a cordless phone in his hand.
DAVID: . He's not homeless Howard, they just don't say where he lives. Well it's a silly question. Because nobody's homeless in REVERSE ANGLE. HIS POV. His mother loads the final Louis Vuitton bag into her . because that's just not what it's She fires up the car and pulls out of the driveway.
DAVID: . because that's just not what it's She fires up the car and pulls out of the driveway.
JENNIFER: ( stunned ) What are you doing?
DAVID: What are you doing? Neither one moves. They clutch the remote together.
JENNIFER: David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna like be here in five minutes.
DAVID: Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.
JENNIFER: Pleasantville Marathon?
DAVID: ( almost reverently ) Yeah. Every episode ever.
JENNIFER: ( getting hysterical ) Omigod, I don't be-lieeeeve this! He's gonna like beeeee here!
DAVID: Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.
JENNIFER: Upstairs! Up-staiiirs! There isn't any
STEREO!: Jennifer gets panicked and yanks at the remote. David yanks back and before they know it, the remote goes flying out of their hands, CRASHING onto the hardwood floor. lt smashes into a million tiny pieces.
DAVID: ( breathless ) Oh my God . ( sinking to his knees/ scooping up the remains ) Oh my God .
JENNIFER: David, stop stressing, you can like turn it on normally .
DAVID: No you can't, Jen! It's a new TV. It doesn't work without a remote. David cradles the pieces like a fallen comrade, when the DOORBELL RINGS behind him.
JENNIFER: Oh my God! He's here! Jennifer sweeps some of the pieces frantically under the sofa and tries to adjust her outfit on the way to the door. David just stares in shock at the shattered plastic. Jennifer reaches the front door and wets her lips. She fluffs her hair quickly, sticks out her chest then swings it open.
JENNIFER: ( beat ) TV repair?
JENNIFER: ( pause . ) Yeah .
DAVID: Yeah . Sort of .
DAVID: ( tentatively ) You know, we didn't call any TV repair.
JENNIFER: You think you could do this like soon? It's almost six thirty.
DAVID: ( cutting her off ) The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six At that moment there is a huge FORK OF LIGHTNING and a booming CLAP OF THUNDER. It literally rattles the walls of the house as Dick Van Dyke turns toward David.
JENNIFER: That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
DAVID: ( stunned ) . Her father.
DAVID: ( still staring ) . Like Prince Charming.
JENNIFER: Umhello? I've got like a social emergency here.
DAVID: Yeah .
DAVID: DICK VAN DYKE No. McIntire's. Remember: ( sings ) "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
DAVID: No. McIntire's. Remember: "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
DAVID: DICK VAN DYKE Sure. Big beautiful set like thisyou want something that'll put you right in the show.
JENNIFER: ( quickly ) We'll take it.
DAVID: ( beat ) How much does it cost?
JENNIFER: DICK VAN DYKE Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the least I could do. There is a SECOND CLAP OF THUNDER even louder than the first. The house rattles for a moment then is quiet.
DAVID: It ail seems normal as he pushes another button. This time the channel changes.
JENNIFER: Lemme see that.
DAVID: No way. He continues to flip through the channels, coming to rest on the Pleasantville Marathon. BUD'S VOICE fills the room.
JENNIFER: Do you mind. This is like the most important moment of my whole life.
DAVID: Forget it Jen, I've waited a year for "But I told Mr. Miller I'd bring a transistor in to electric shop."
JENNIFER: ( yanking at it ) God, David. Just give it to me!
DAVID: ( yanking it back ) Get lost!
JENNIFER: YOU get lost!
DAVID: ( a whisper ) Oh my God.
JENNIFER: What happened?
DAVID: I'm not sure.
WIDER: George Parker ( Bud and Mary Sue's father ) enters from the landing whistling a happy tune. He's dressed in a gray suit with a gray shirt, and a dark gray tie with little gray dots.
GEORGE: ( as if to his own children ) Hi Sport, hi Muffin . Better get a move on, you're gonna be late for school. He continues to cross through the living room whistling into the kitchen .
JENNIFER: ( desperately ) What did you do?
DAVID: I don't know.
JENNIFER: ( examining her black and white skin ) Uchh! Look at me?! I'm like so . pasty! He glances down at the remote control that sits lifeless in his hand. David frantically presses the buttons but nothing happens. All at once, there is a voice behind them.
JENNIFER: What happened?
DAVID: ( to the TV set ) What the hell's going on!
DAVID: We're in Pleasantville?
JENNIFER: ( panicking ) This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
MARK DAVIS: ( under his breath ) . Bitch.
JENNIFER: Youyou gotta get us out of here.
DAVID: Youyou gotta get us out of here.
DAVID: Because we don't belong!
DAVID: My name's David.
JENNIFER: ( wailing on the floor ) Oh GOD .
DAVID: Lookwe appreciate it. We really do. We justwe want to go home now.
DAVID: Don't get upset.
DAVID: Where are you going .
DAVID: WAIT A MINUTE!! Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional .
DAVID: COME BACK!!! Dick Van Dyke shakes his head and walks out of the shot as the screen goes completely BLACK. It cuts out entirely as Jennifer and David just stare. David grabs the remote and starts rapidly pushing buttons. Nothing happens.
COME BACK!!!: Dick Van Dyke shakes his head and walks out of the shot as the screen goes completely BLACK. It cuts out entirely as Jennifer and David just stare. David grabs the remote and starts rapidly pushing buttons. Nothing happens.
JENNIFER: What's going to happen?
DAVID: I don't know . It's not possible . Is it possible?
DAVID: It can't be possible.
BETTY: Well, come on kids. You're not going off to school without a hot breakfast inside you . They just stare at her.
JENNIFER: ( dazed ) INT. KITCHEN. David and Jennifer walk two steps into the kitchen when they suddenly freezeagape at the spectacle in front of them:
GEORGE: ( once again ) Morning kids. Better get a move on or you're going to be late for school. They nod, stunned, and wander forward into the room. Bright sunlight streams through the kitchen window as a gentle symphony of songbirds sings outside. David and Jennifer stare straight ahead as their "mother" adds some waffles to the ( under his breath ) I don't believe this.
DAVID: ( under his breath ) I don't believe this.
JENNIFER: Neither do I.
GEORGE: Well, c'mon. Dig in. David and Jennifer stare at her stunned as she puts two heaping plates at their places. Neither one moves.
BETTY: ( to Jennifer ) I put blueberries in them just the way you like.
JENNIFER: ActuallyI'm not real . hungry.
BETTY: ( big smile ) Oh nonsense young lady. You're going to start your day with a nice big breakfast. She takes Jennifer by the shoulders and "guides" her into the chair. Jennifer looks down at a huge plate of GRAY WAFFLES.
PAT BOONE: ". Tooty fruityoh rooty. Tooty Fruity . Oh rooty." He CONTINUES his homogenized version of Little Richard's nasty hit, ( all the nastiness gone ). It becomes a slow and lilting melody .
JENNIFER: I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God.
DAVID: Just take deep breaths.
JENNIFER: All that animal fat. I feel it in my pores or something. Jennifer clutches her stomach, but David's glance darts from side to sidetotally absorbed.
DAVID: We're supposed to be in school.
JENNIFER: We're supposed to be at home David! We're supposed to be in color! Oh God . A man calls out from across the street.
MR. SIMPSON: Hello Bud.
DAVID: Hello Mr. Simpson.
MR. SIMPSON: Hear your Dad got a new car.
DAVID: Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.
JENNIFER: You know him?
DAVID: Owns the hardware store.
JENNIFER: Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!
DAVID: We just gotta play along for a little while . till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and .
JENNIFER: Play along?
DAVID: Well, yeah. I'm . Bud Parker and you're . umMary Sue.
JENNIFER: ( ripping the barette from her hair ) No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!
DAVID: We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back.
JENNIFER: Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
DAVID: To who? Jen looks around this cheery little street, and the horror starts to dawn on her. At that moment, they hear a screaming SIREN and a bright GRAY FIRE ENGINE comes racing up the Jennifer and David step back on the curb as the firemen come flying out of the truck, grabbing the ladder on the back.
FIREMAN: C'mere, kitty . He emerges a moment later with the cat who was stuck in the tree. Jennifer sinks to the curb as he carries the kitten by them, petting it gently as he goes.
JENNIFER: Oh God, we are. We're stuck in like I always knew you'd pay a price for this. I knew you couldn't be hopelessly geekridden for this long without suffering some like, really tragic . But it's just not fair. I meanI'm starting to get reallypopular. Debbi Russell transferred to another school and my skin's been great since March and Mark Davis is starting to come around and .
JENNIFER: Um . It's . Biff turns to see the fireman climb into the truck, with the kitty in his arms.
BIFF: Ah, right . Wellguess I'll see ya later Mary Sue. He takes off down the street with the sun glinting on his really keen convertible. Jennifer gapes as he disappears around the corner.
JENNIFER: Who's that?
DAVID: Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball Does heyou knowlike "me"?
JENNIFER: ( still gaping ) Does heyou knowlike "me"?
DAVID: As a matter of fact he does.
JENNIFER: ( flicking her hair ) EXT. PLEASANTVILLE HIGH SCHOOL. DAY. Streams of impeccably kept youngsters file through the double doors. All cheery and very pleasant looking. It looks like a Leni Riefenstahl movie.
JENNIFER: Those are my friends.
DAVID: Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean.
JENNIFER: ( staring at them ) Can we do any better?
DAVID: I don't think so.
LISA ANNE: ( seeing her ) Mary Sue. You're gonna be late for Okay . She flicks her hair backcops a first day of school attitude, and heads across the street like she owns the INT. GEOGRAPHY CLASS. LATER . It looks like a propaganda film from the Eisenhower Administration. The boys all wear crew cuts and short sleeve button down shirts. The girls all have lacy dresses buttoned to the neck. Everyone stares straight ahead at the ANGLE. FRONT OF THE ROOM. TEACHER. Miss Peters stands in front of the class with a pointer in her hand. She indicates a diagram that spans the length of the blackboard.
JENNIFER: Okay . She flicks her hair backcops a first day of school attitude, and heads across the street like she owns the INT. GEOGRAPHY CLASS. LATER . It looks like a propaganda film from the Eisenhower Administration. The boys all wear crew cuts and short sleeve button down shirts. The girls all have lacy dresses buttoned to the neck. Everyone stares straight ahead at the ANGLE. FRONT OF THE ROOM. TEACHER. Miss Peters stands in front of the class with a pointer in her hand. She indicates a diagram that spans the length of the blackboard.
MISS PETERS: Last week Class, we discussed the geography of Main Street. This week, we're going to be talking about Elm Street. Can anyone tell me one of the differences between Elm Street and Main It's not as long? Jennifer looks stunned as several students nod.
TOMMY: It's not as long? Jennifer looks stunned as several students nod.
MISS PETERS: That's right, Tommy. It's not as long. Also, it only has houses. So the geography of Main Street is different than the geography of Elm Street.
MISS PETERS: Mary Sue.
JENNIFER: What's outside of Pleasantville? The teacher looks at her with a puzzled frozen smile on her face. She looks vaguely troubled.
MISS PETERS: ( beat ) I don't understand .
JENNIFER: Outside of Pleasantville . What's at the end of Main Street? The class lets out a knowing groanas if to say "Oh. We get it now. Boy what a stupid question." Miss Peters gives a kind but condescending look.
MISS PETERS: Oh, Mary Sue. You should know the answer to that. The end of Main Street is just the beginning again. Miss Peters gives a big grin as a series of heads nod up and down. Jennifer stares straight ahead, dumbfounded .
DAVID: He stares at the backboard slightly intrigued. David retrieves the ball and fires again, this time chucking it up blind. The ball sails through the hoop again, HITTING
COACH: That's it men. Keep it up. Big game ANGLE. DAVID. He gets the ball and turns his back on the basket completely. David flings the ball wildly over his shoulder. It bounces off all the walls of the gym, then glides through the net as smoothly as the others. He stares in amazement.
BIFF: ( a little nervous ) Hi ya Bud.
BUD: Hi ya Biff. He fidgets nervously for a moment looking down.
BIFF: Can I ask you a question?
BUD: Well . If I was to ask your sister . What I mean is, if I was to go up to Mary Sue .
BIFF: Well . If I was to ask your sister . What I mean is, if I was to go up to Mary Sue .
DAVID: Oh God! Are we in that episode?
BIFF: I don't believe it.
DAVID: I don't believe it.
BIFF: What's the matter?
DAVID: You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin .
BIFF: Yeah . How'd you know?
DAVID: ( shaking his head ) Lucky guess. ( beat ) Look, Biff . I don't think it's a real good time for that right now . Biff's expression falls. He stands crushed in front of David.
BIFF: ( stunned ) She won't go out with me?
DAVID: I didn't say that. It's just that right now .
BIFF: I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't go out with me . All at once, Biff takes the basketball he's been holding and hurls it toward the hoop. The ball does a couple of revolutions of the rim, and then amazingly pops out.
DAVID: ( under his breath ) Look, I'm sure we'll work something out. I'll talk to her or something. Biff looks at him, troubled.
JENNIFER: No way.
DAVID: One date, Jenthat's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
JENNIFER: It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank?
DAVID: I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
JENNIFER: I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
DAVID: What were you doing in a library?
JENNIFER: I got lost. Oh here . look at this! She reaches into her purse and pulls out a book of matches. Jennifer tries to light a Kleenex on fire.
DAVID: Just watch. You know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing burns around here, that's why! They don't need any firemen . Sure enough the tissue has become flame retardant.
JENNIFER!: Just watch. You know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing burns around here, that's why! They don't need any firemen . Sure enough the tissue has become flame retardant.
JENNIFER: Just watch. You know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing burns around here, that's why! They don't need any firemen . Sure enough the tissue has become flame retardant.
DAVID: Jen, listen .
JENNIFER: ( trembling ) I likereally need a cigarette, too.
DAVID: ( putting his arm around her ) I'll get us out of here. I really will. But if we don't play along we could alter their whole existence. We may never get home. She looks over at him, slowly.
JENNIFER: You really think anybody's gonna, like, notice if I don't have a chocolate malt with this guy. At that moment, three of Mary Sue's "friends" come tittering around the comer. They skitter up to her like a group of wind-up toys.
PEGGY JANE: ( high-pitchedrapid fire ) You won't believe what we just heard.
LISA ANNE: Biff Martin's going to ask you out.
BETTY JEAN: And that's not all .
PEGGY JANE: No, that's not all .
JENNIFER: You sure I'm supposed to wear this?
JENNIFER: ( looking in the mirror ) I could like kill a guy with these It's in your closet.
DAVID: It's in your closet.
JENNIFER: ( examining her profile ) I've worn some kinky stuff before .
DAVID: He won't notice anyway.
JENNIFER: What do you mean?
DAVID: They don't notice that kind of thing.
JENNIFER: So what's the point?
DAVID: Jen please .
JENNIFER: He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here .
DAVID: Just go with the programhunh? I'm late for work.
MR. JOHNSON: ( looking up ) Sorry . I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat .
DAVID: Sorry . I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat .
MR. JOHNSON: He stops wiping for a moment, holding the towel in his hand.
DAVID: What's wrong?
MR. JOHNSON: WellI always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries .
DAVID: ( confused ) Yeah .
MR. JOHNSON: But you didn't come so I kept on wiping. He looks down at the towel clearly disturbed. David pauses for a moment then starts toward him.
DAVID: I'm sorry. He crosses to Mr. Johnson who has polished one section of the counter right down to the wood. David takes the towel out of his hand and folds it neatly in front of him.
MR. JOHNSON: I'm so glad you're here.
DAVID: I understand.
BIFF: Oh. Mary Sue .
DAVID: ( frazzled ) Peppermint shake, chocolate soda, two orders of fries and a split?
MR. JOHNSON: There aren't any cheeseburgers.
DAVID: ( turning ) Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce .
MR. JOHNSON: Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce .
DAVID: Listen to me! Mr. Johnson recoils slightly.
MR. JOHNSON: . Yeah.
DAVID: Have you cooked the burgers?
MR. JOHNSON: ( quieter ) Well you can just put on the lettuce, finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along. Mr. Johnson stares at him.
DAVID: Well you can just put on the lettuce, finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along. Mr. Johnson stares at him.
BIFF: ( haltingly ) I sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight Mary Sue.
JENNIFER: ( full blown "Mary Sue" ) Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad you asked me. He guffaws for a moment or two before speaking again.
BIFF: I don't know if I ever said this to you before, but, well . I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school .
JENNIFER: Really Biff? The keenest?
BIFF: Oh yeah.
JENNIFER: ( all sarcasm ) Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
BIFF: Oh, I dunno Bud. Guess I'll have my usual cheeseburger and a cherry coke. More goony laughs. David turns to Jennifer who puts on the same dopey countenance.
JENNIFER: Oh, I dunno Bud. Guess I'll just have a salad and an Evian Water. He shoots her a dirty look. Jennifer just smiles at him.
BIFF: See the whole time we were in civics together, I really wanted to sit next to youbut you were always sitting between Peggy Jane and Lisa Anne. There is some TITTERING behind her. Jennifer doesn't respond.
JENNIFER: Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
BIFF: ( goony laugh ) Oh, right . He still doesn't understand. Biff GUFFAWS for a moment or two then glances down at the table top. There is a momentary break in the Music as Johnny Mathis' "MISTY" starts up all over again. It's enough to make you shoot yourself.
JENNIFER: Oh, gosh no.
BIFF: I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you?
JENNIFER: Oh you bet. Will you excuse me for a sec? Jennifer gets up in a daze and heads toward the bathroom.
JENNIFER: Jesus Chirist . She turns and sits against the sink for a moment with a dumbstruck look on her face. Jennifer shakes her head for a moment or two, when the door to the bathroom bursts open.
GIRL'S VOICES: ( overlapping ) "Did he give it to you . Did he give it to you . I bet he gave it to her . Did he give it to you?"
JENNIFER: ( straight ahead ) I don't think he knows how. They TITTER away, even though they don't get it either. It sounds like an aviary.
LISA ANNE: I bet he's gonna take her to Lover's I bet he is. I bet he is.
PEGGY JANE: I bet he is. I bet he is.
BETTY JEAN: I bet he's even gonna hold her hand! They TITTER some more as Jennifer shakes her head.
DAVID: ( chipper ) Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry ( pointedly ) If you need anything, I'll be right over ( Mary Sue ) Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly need when we have each other? She flashes him a "sweet" smile then reaches out and TOUCHES BIFF'S HAND. Both boys jump slightly as Jennifer gives her brother a venomous grin then suddenly waves "bye bye." David just stares at her panicked as he moves haltingly back to the Soda fountain.

BIFF: ( befuddled ) Anyhow . I really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but .
JENNIFER: You want to get out of here?
BIFF: You wanna get out of here? You wanna But where would we go?
JENNIFER: You wanna get out of here? You wanna But where would we go?
BIFF: ( confused ) But where would we go?
JENNIFER: ( shrugging ) . Lover's Lane.
BIFF: ( swallow ) Lover's Lane! There is an audible GASP from the booth behind them. Jennifer ignores it.
JENNIFER: Yeah. Lover's Lane. You up for it?
JENNIFER: C'mon. Let's go.
DAVID: He vaults over the counter making a bee-line for the door. Everyone turns and stares as he races toward the entrance .
NOOOOOO!: He vaults over the counter making a bee-line for the door. Everyone turns and stares as he races toward the entrance .
DAVID: YOU CAN'T DO THIS JENNIFER! HE DOESN'T EXIST! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T EXIST! The tail lights recede in the distance as David slows to a jog and then finally a walk. He pauses, winded, in the street, then looks up toward Heaven with a pissed off look on his face.
DOESN'T EXIST!: The tail lights recede in the distance as David slows to a jog and then finally a walk. He pauses, winded, in the street, then looks up toward Heaven with a pissed off look on his face.
BIFF: Sure is pretty.
JENNIFER: ( staring at him ) Oh yeah . Gorgeous.
BIFF: To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
JENNIFER: Oh, Biff. You can "pin" me any time you want to. She leans back a liftle more, draping her arm across the top of the seat. Her tits point toward the sky.
BIFF: Oh, that's silly Mary Sue. How could you possibly pin me?
BETTY: His "mother" and "father" come out onto the porch. David catches his breath then forces a smile.
GEORGE: Son, what's wrong?
DAVID: Have you seen Mary Sue?
BETTY: Why no. She's still on her date with Biff . is something the matter?
DAVID: ( still panting a little ) No, I . I was just . worried about His mother and father exchange a "knowing" look. George rests a hand on his shoulder.
GEORGE: ( oppressively paternal ) Bud, your sister's a little older now and she's naturally going to start going out with boys. ( beat ) . In fact pretty soonshe's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother ( smiles at Betty/ inside joke ) That's IF she can learn to bake.
BETTY: Oh, George .
GEORGE: But your sister is a fine young woman and she would never do anything for us to be concerned about.
BIFF: ( some terror ) I think I better go home now Mary Sue . She holds onto his shirt as her knee rubs the dashboard.
JENNIFER: ( breathless ) . Why?
BIFF: ( more terror ) I think . I might be ill . He glances down at his lap a little confused.
JENNIFER: It's s'posed to happen, Biff.
BIFF: It is?
JENNIFER: Trust me . He looks at her completely confused as she pulls back down, and OUT OF FRAME .
DAVID: ( sick ) Oh no . I'm fine.
BETTY: How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
DAVID: I'm fine. There is a knock behind them at the door. David springs up.
BETTY: Now who could that be.
DAVID: Oh hi!
MR. JOHNSON: Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.
DAVID: Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm fine. I just . Had to get home early. Mr. Johnson leans in closer and speaks in a CONFIDENTIAL tone of voice.
MR. JOHNSON: Bud .
DAVID: Yeah .
MR. JOHNSON: ( sotto ) You know how when we close up, I close the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors.
DAVID: Yeah .
MR. JOHNSON: ( proud ) Well you weren't around this time so I did the whole thing myself.
MR. JOHNSON: ( more confidential ) Not only that, I didn't even do it in the same order. First I lowered the shades, then I closed the register. He looks at David with pride then suddenly shifts his glance behind him.
BETTY: Hello Bill. Neither one says anything but neither one has to. David looks on in horror as his mother locks eyes with Mr. Johnson and his new found virility.
DAVID: ( quickly ) Well, look, thanks for coming by. I . really appreciate it. He turns and starts hustling him down the walk just as Biff's convertible pulls up at the curb.
JENNIFER: Well gee thanks Biff. I had a really wonderful time.
BIFF: . Me too. She leans over and kisses him on the cheek . Then she bites his ear lobe, gently, and flashes him a big smile. Biff smiles back.
JENNIFER: ( sweetly ) Hello Mr. Johnson.
MR. JOHNSON: Oh, hello Mary Sue. She is wearing a big smile by the time she reaches the porch. David grabs her arm.
DAVID: ( urgent whisper ) What did you do to him?
JENNIFER: ( innocently ) She starts up the staircase. David follows her and the CAMERA follows them both.
DAVID: What do you mean "nothing?" That's not nothing. That's . She reaches the top of the stairs and turns to him.
JENNIFER: Relax "Bud." We had a really nice time. . Now I'm really tired and we gotta get up early for school in the morning so . She flashes her brother an evil grin.
DAVID: ( quietly ) Oh no . Biff continues his story while they stare at him with their mouths open. The Coach blows his whistle.
COACH: Come on men. Let's go. Big game next The huddle breaks up as the basketball players all wander toward the hoop. Ten shots go up at once but NOT ONE COMES EVEN CLOSE. Several clang off the rim, a couple hit the edge of the backboard. One slams into the side of the gym. Everyone stares in disbelief.
DAVID: Oh my God .
DAVID: You can't do this, Jennifer. I WARNED So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay. They're like not good at basketball anymore. Likeomigod, what a tragedy.
JENNIFER: So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay. They're like not good at basketball anymore. Likeomigod, what a tragedy.
DAVID: You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE.
JENNIFER: Well maybe it needs to be messed with. Did that ever likeoccur to you? You know, they don't want to be like this, it's just that nobody ever helped them before.
PEGGY JANE: ( walking past ) "MS". How you doin'?
JENNIFER: Kewl "PJ". How you doin'?
PEGGY JANE: ( relishing her new word ) Jennifer smiles at her friend as she goes by.
DAVID: You have no right to do this.
JENNIFER: Well if I don't who will?
DAVID: They're happy like this.
JENNIFER: David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set. You like all this don't you? David recoils slightly.
DAVID: I just don't think we have the right to .
JENNIFER: David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be "attractive." They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any They don't have that kind of potential.
DAVID: They don't have that kind of potential.
JENNIFER: Umhello? You want to like take a look? Jennifer motions behind her to a boy and girt who are locked in an intimate conversation. The girl wears bobby socks and the boy wears a letterman's sweater, but the conversation is sexually charged. They speak to one another in a close whispertheir faces inches apart. All at once the girt gets shy and glances away. She blows a big bubble with her gum, but the BUBBLE IS BRIGHT PINK IN AN OTHERWISE GRAY FRAME.
BOY: Wow. What kind of gum is that?
JENNIFER: I gotta go. I'm meeting Biff at the EXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT. It is the exact same shot as before: The CAMERA STARTS ITS LONG SLOW TRACK behind the vehicles, except this time ALL OF THEM ARE ROCKING. Various limbs and articles of clothing hang out the open windows. MOANS of pleasure waft out over Lover's Lane as the pond glistens in the distance .
DR. HENDERSON: Let me see it again. Lisa Anne opens her mouth and sticks out a BRIGHT RED TONGUE. Everything else in the frame is Black and White, but her tongue literally gleams with color.
DAVID: What'll it be?
BIFF: ( still chipper as ever ) Gee whizz, Bud. Guess I'll just have the usual. Cheeseburger and a cherry coke. Bud has already written it down. He glances over at his Me too. Sounds swell.
JENNIFER: Me too. Sounds swell.
DAVID: ( pointed ) Really? It seems so fattening. Before she can answer he smiles to himself and crosses behind the counter. Bud posts the order and turns to Mr. Johnson.
MR. JOHNSON: ( staring straight ahead ) There aren't any cheeseburgers.
DAVID: ( exasperated ) Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said .
MR. JOHNSON: Ohwhat's the point, Bud?
DAVID: He pulls him along the counter toward a little office storeroom in the back. He yanks him inside and shuts the INT. STOREROOM. It is just as cheery as the rest of the place. There is a small table with a telephone on it. A Texaco calendar shows a happy family motoring in their Rambler.
DAVID: What did you say? Mr. Johnson glances down with a little shame and confusion.
MR. JOHNSON: Well . I'm not sure I see the point What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point!
DAVID: What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point!
MR. JOHNSON: No I know . I know I do . But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese . It never changes. It never gets any better or worse .
DAVID: Just listen to me .
MR. JOHNSON: ( not hearing him ) . Like the other night, when I closed up by myself. That was different .
DAVID: Forget about that!
MR. JOHNSON: Oh . Okay. . But I really liked it. Bud takes a deep breath. He stares at Mr. Johnson, then tries to speak softly.
DAVID: Look, you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway.
MR. JOHNSON: ( exasperated ) So they can have their hamburgers! This sounds stupid even to David. He shakes his head.
DAVID: ( exasperated ) So they can have their hamburgers! This sounds stupid even to David. He shakes his head.
MR. JOHNSON: ( like a secret ) You know what I really like?
DAVID: ( warily ) . What's that?
MR. JOHNSON: David rolls his eyes. Mr. Johnson leans closer, speaking He pulls a photo album from the back of the desk and opens it for David.
DAVID: ( impressed ) Wow . That's pretty good .
MR. JOHNSON: ( continuing ) But this morning I was thinking about it and I realized that I looked forward to it all year. And then I thought "Gee. That seems awfully silly. That seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment, don't you think?" David looks at him speechless.
DAVID: I think you should try not to think about this anymore.
MR. JOHNSON: MR. JOHNSON Oh. Okay. I'll try that then.
DAVID: MR. JOHNSON Oh. Okay. I'll try that then.
MR. JOHNSON: Oh. Okay. I'll try that then.
GUS: Have they ever lost before?
GEORGE: Basketball? No they sure haven't.
BOB: Just feels "wrong", that's all. There are several murmurs.
THIRD PATRON: Maybe that's where they get that saying, "can't win 'em all."
GUS: Yeah. That's a good point, Ralph. They do have that saying.
BOB: But they do win 'em all, Gus. They've always won 'em all.
GUS: Well, yeah. That's true too. More murmurs, Everyone looks straight ahead trying to figure.
MARGE: ( dealing the cards ) . He said it would clear up on its own if she just stayed away from fried foods and sweets .
BETTY: Well that makes sense.
MARGE: Except it's spread to her lips now too. Oh, I don't know.
MARY: ( a THIRD WOMAN ) And you say it's just "red?"
MARGE: Welllike red, only . "redder."
MARY: Hunh. I know what you mean. That's like the front of Bill Johnson's shop. I was going by it the other day and it looked green only "greener."
MARGE: ( lowering her voice ) Have you seen him lately? The man doesn't look like himself. I was getting my sewing machine fixed across the street and he was sitting in the window of his shop just staring. Wasn't looking at anything in particularjust staring off into space.
MARY: That is strange. Betty reaches out and grabs her cards. She fans them out in front of her, when her eyes go wide.
MARGE: Betty, it's your bid. She swallows trying to keep her composure.
BETTY: Uh . Seven hearts. They murmur at the strength of the hand.
BETTY: Mary Sue?
JENNIFER: Betty hesitates. Rinses out a pot.
BETTY: Can I ask you a question?
JENNIFER: She pauses for a long moment.
BETTY: What goes on up at Lover's Lane?
JENNIFER: ( turning toward her ) What do you mean?
BETTY: Well, you hear all these things lately. You knowkids spending so much time up there . Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
JENNIFER: Yeah . Thatand . She stops herself.
BETTY: It doesn't matter.
JENNIFER: It doesn't matter.
BETTY: No. I want to know.
JENNIFER: ( glances toward the living room/ lowers her voice ) . Sex.
BETTY: Betty nods from the import of the tone but not the meaning. A beat goes by .
JENNIFER: You sure you want to know this?
BETTY: She crosses to the kitchen door and closes it. The sounds of the TV in the living room disappear. Jennifer crosses back to the kitchen counter and turns to her.
JENNIFER: She crosses to the kitchen door and closes it. The sounds of the TV in the living room disappear. Jennifer crosses back to the kitchen counter and turns to her.
JENNIFER: You okay?
BETTY: Yes . It's just that .
JENNIFER: ( gently ) Well . ( looking up ) . Your father would never do anything like that.
BETTY: Well . . Your father would never do anything like that.
JENNIFER: ( leaning forward ) Oh. Hmm . ( whisper/ woman to woman ) Well, Mom . there's ways to "enjoy" yourself without Dad.
GEORGE: Sweetie? You coming to bed? There is no answer.
BETTY: ( calling out ) Yeah . I'm just going to take a bath CLOSER. BETTY. She swallows once as she stares down at the tubthen reaches for the spigot and turns on the water. Betty's heart beats a little faster as she HEARS the WATER THUNDERING DOWN.
DAVID: Oh my God!
DAVID: Jesus Christ .
DAVID: FIRE! FIRE! INT. FIRE STATION. There is no sign of life on the ground floor. David races up the stairs toward the bunk room on the second story.
FIRE! FIRE!: INT. FIRE STATION. There is no sign of life on the ground floor. David races up the stairs toward the bunk room on the second story.
DAVID: ( entering )
CAT!!!: All at once they spring to their feet grabbing their helmets and their yellow slickers. They race to the landing just outside the bunkroom and leap onto the pole .
DAVID: Right here! The Fire ENGINE screeches to a halt. The Fire Chief looks around .
FIRE CHIEF: Where is it? David shoots him a look then glances at the inferno. He shakes his head and leaps from the truck.
DAVID: Here! Grab this nozzle.
FIREMAN: But where's the .
DAVID: Just grab it! He strips out about fifteen feet of hose, then grabs the fireman and pulls him toward the curb. David parts the crowd and positions the man right in front of the flames.
FIREMAN: ( beat ) So that's what these do. A huge smile breaks out across the fireman's facelike a man who has suddenly found his purpose in life. He beams from ear to ear dousing the flames, while David runs to get another hose .
BOB: . And with great appreciation from the citizens of Pleasantville .
BOB: I am pleased to present You with this special commendation, from the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce! He hands the plaque to David as the entire town bursts into
GIRL'S VOICE: Hi Bud .
MARGARET: That was sure swell .
DAVID: Oh. Thanks, Margaret.
MARGARET: ( smiling ) I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
DAVID: ( vaguely remembering an episode ) Oh, no . You baked those for Whitey.
MARGARET: No. I baked them for you.
DAVID: No. You baked them for Whitey.
MARGARET: ( low and gutteral ) No. I baked them for you. All at once, Margaret grabs his arm and presses herself up against him. Her breasts shove up against his chest. Her mouth is inches away from his.
DAVID: Um . thanks. David can smell the weird combination of hot moist breath and freshly baked cookies. He stares into her eyes for a moment, unable to speak. Margaret flashes him a not-so Pleasantville See ya. She turns and heads around the comer, while David just watches her dumbstruck.
MARGARET: See ya. She turns and heads around the comer, while David just watches her dumbstruck.
JENNIFER: ( in a whisper ) I had nothing to do with that fire.
DAVID: ( quietly ) It's okay.
JENNIFER: Not directly anyhow .
DAVID: It's fine. David glances at the booth beside them and realizes that the bongos have stopped playing. All the kids are staring up at him, with a weird expression of awe.
JENNIFER: ( still under her breath ) Um . They like wanna ask you a question . I didn't know how to handle it. So .
DAVID: He crosses to the booth where Biff and two others look up at him. It's like Elvis has entered the building.
VARIOUS KIDS: Swell . They keep on staring. Several glances are exchanged back and forth like they're sharing a secret. Finally .
BOY: How'd you know about the fire?
DAVID: How'd you know how to put it out and David hesitates, weighing his words.
BOY: How'd you know how to put it out and David hesitates, weighing his words.
DAVID: Wellwhere I used to live . That's just what firemen did. This sends a MURMUR through the shop. The boy leans forward.
BOY: And where's that?
DAVID: ( carefully ) Um . Outside of Pleasantville. This sends a much LOUDER MURMUR rifling through the kids. It's like electricity. They glance excited at one another. A hush descends.
BOY: What's outside of Pleasantville?
DAVID: Look it doesn't matter. It's not What is it? David stops and looks out at the kids who are hanging on every word.
BOY: What is it? David stops and looks out at the kids who are hanging on every word.
DAVID: It's really not important.
DAVID: ( slowly ) Well . There are some places where the road doesn't go in a circle. There are some places where it keeps on going. There's an excited giggle. They lean forward.
MARGARET: ( an exotic concept ) Keeps going .
DAVID: Wellit all just keeps going. Roads . rivers .
2ND BOY: ( from the back ) Like the "Mighty Mississippi".
DAVID: . What? He moves forward extending a book. The cover reads: "THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKELBERRY FINN." David opens the first page. There is printing inside.
BOY: ( quoting ) "It was big 'n brown 'n kept goin' an' goin' as far you could see."
DAVID: ( turning to Jennifer ) I thought the books were blank?
JENNIFER: They were. He looks over at her.
DAVID: The pages filled in?
JENNIFER: But like only up to the part about the raft, because I didn't read any David flips through the book and sure enough only the first chapter has print. The pages are blank after that.
2ND BOY: Do you know how it ends?
DAVID: ( hesitating ) Well, yeah . I do.
MARGARET: ( breathless ) So how does it end? She has moved closer and is gazing at him from a couple of feet away. It's silent in the soda shop.
DAVID: Wellsee . they're both running awayHuck and the slave . And . They go up the river . Butin trying to get free they sort of see that they're free already. David looks immediately down to the blank pages of the book that aren't blank anymore. Rows and rows of FRESH NEW TYPE materialize in front of him. He turns to the back of the book, that is complete with a COLOR illustration.
2ND BOY: 3RD BOY Do you know this one? He shoves another book in front of David.
3RD BOY: Do you know this one? He shoves another book in front of David.
DAVID: ( looks down at the book ) Oh yeah . Well this is great. ( beat ) SeeHolden Caulfield is like this really lonely kid.
GUS: I don't know Phil. It's pretty strange.
PHIL: I'll say it's strange. Gettin' stranger. Big Bob McGee nods and rubs his hands over his fresh haircut.
BURT: Oughtta be havin' an ice cream soda. That's where they oughtta be.
GEORGE: Want some bridge mix?
BOB: Oh, no thanks .
GEORGE: Betty's making some pineapple kabobs .
BOB: I'm finebut thank you. George nods as Bob takes a belt of his Martini and leans George, you're probably wondering why I asked if I could come over today . George shrugsthen nodsthen shrugs .
GEORGE: ( nodding ) ( takes a belt of martini ) And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things. ( beat ) Did you hear about Bill Miller?
BOB: ( nodding ) ( takes a belt of martini ) And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things. ( beat ) Did you hear about Bill Miller?
GEORGE: ( concerned ) No. What?
BOB: Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
GEORGE: One of those . big beds? Bob nods.
BOB: I really don't know. Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.
GEORGE: . How?
BIG BOB: Said he didn't want to do it anymore. Just took off his apron in the middle of an order. Mrs. Thompson had her groceries spread all over the counter . Took 'em four hours to sort the whole thing out.
GEORGE: Holy cow. Bob takes a belt of his drink .
BIG BOB: George, everyone likes you.
GEORGE: Oh well .
BOB: No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler . They respect you .
GEORGE: ( heartfelt ) Thank you very much.
BOB: And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.
GEORGE: No. Of course not.
BOB: ( big patriarchal smile ) And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
GEORGE: ( stunned/ moved ) Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
BOB: ( smiling ) Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
GEORGE: Oh sure . You bet. Betty . There is no answer.
DAVID: I'll get her. He moves quickly to the kitchen shutting the door behind him.
DAVID: ( approaching slowly ) Are you okay? She doesn't answer. David moves up to her and rests a hand on her shoulder.
BETTY: ( fighting tears ) What am I going to do? David moves closer and looks at her. Her lip is quivering.
DAVID: It's okay. It's alright.
BETTY: ( trembling ) I can't go out there. How can I go out She looks right up at David.
DAVID: Have you got any make up?
BETTY: In my handbag. He crosses to the counter and grabs her purse. David sits Betty on a kitchen chair and fishes inside the handbag for her compact. He finds it along with a wadded up Kleenex.
DAVID: Okayfirst we'll dry you out a little. He dabs at the tears, while she smiles at him in gratitude, Then David opens the compact and takes out the large GRAY powder puff.
BETTY: ( off his reaction ) David shakes his head and forces a smile. He hands her the compact so she can examine herself. Betty holds it up to her face, turning her head first right, then left.
DAVID: Looks just like it did.
BETTY: And they won't be able to tell?
DAVID: ( even quieter ) No . They won't be able to tell. Betty takes a deep breath and fluffs her hair. She grabs the plate of Pineapple kabobs and heads for the door. Just before she goes in, she pauses, then plasters on a big wide "stewardess" smile .
BETTY: ( turning back ) He wants to say something, but doesn't. David shakes his It's fine. She smiles again and balances the tray in front of her.
DAVID: It's fine. She smiles again and balances the tray in front of her.
BETTY: Thank you.
DAVID: ( sadly ) He watches as she opens the door, and marches in the room, extending the little tray of hors d'oeuvres in front of her .
MR. JOHNSON: Oh, hi.
DAVID: ( entering ) Aren't you a little early?
MR. JOHNSON: Aren't you a little early?
DAVID: ( quietly ) I brought you something . From the CLOSER. FOLLOWING DAVID. He has a large book tucked under his arm that is easily three feet long. Mr. Johnson looks at him a little intrigued as David crosses to the counter.
DAVID: It's an art book.
MR. JOHNSON: Oh my Gosh, Bud .
DAVID: Open it. Mr. Johnson reaches out and opens the cover. After a beat, his eyes widen.
MR. JOHNSON: It's beautiful, Bud . He looks up at David, troubled.
DAVID: What's wrong?
MR. JOHNSON: I'll never be able to do that.
DAVID: Oh, wellyou're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it .
MR. JOHNSON: No, that's not it. Mr. Johnson shuts the book gently.
MR. JOHNSON: Must be awfully lucky to see colors like that. I bet they don't even know how lucky they are.
DAVID: ( turning/ lighting up ) Oh . Hi.
MARGARET: ( turning/ lighting up ) Oh . Hi.
DAVID: ( pause ) Look, I probably shouldn't be asking you thisnot knowing you that well and all . Margaret stops in the street and turns to him.
MARGARET: ( breathless ) Sure . Where would we go?
DAVID: ( swallows ) . Lover's Lane?
DAVID: ( calling back ) Sorry .
DAVID: "Oh when the Saints . Go Marching in ." He lets the door slam behind him as he takes off his apron and tosses it on the coat rack. David starts up the stairs, when he HEARS a MAN'S VOICE coming from the living room.
DAVID: ( wary ) . Hi.
DAVID: ( quickly ) I can't.
DAVID: Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to . um . The look turns suddenly dark and ominous.
DAVID: Oh . I do. Yeah. It's just that I told my "dad" I'd clean out the rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted me to . to change the tape in the register .
DAVID: DICK VAN DYKE Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey. ( losing it a little ) . Those aren't your cookies Bud.
DAVID: Oh, I know they're not. But I mean they're just "cookies" after all .
DAVID: Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies . Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?
DAVID: Terrific. I'll talk to you then. He swttches off the TV sending Dick Van Dyke to electronic limbo. David stands in the middle of the living room, breathing hard .
JENNIFER: What's wrong?
DAVID: He keeps breathing hard in the doorway. David holds the remote in his hand.
JENNIFER: He keeps breathing hard in the doorway. David holds the remote in his hand.
DAVID: Listen . He takes a couple of steps into the room and then suddenly You're reading?
JENNIFER: ( glancing at the book ) Yeah. Can't believe you started such a dorky fad. She holds up the cover.
DAVID: ( amazed ) . Yeah.
JENNIFER: Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 That's great. He just stares at her for a second as his mind seems to drift .
DAVID: ( still stunned ) That's great. He just stares at her for a second as his mind seems to drift .
JENNIFER: So what is it?
DAVID: Well . I just . Can I ask you a question?
JENNIFER: Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
DAVID: Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
JENNIFER: Yeah .
DAVID: Welldid she really like me or were you just making that up.
JENNIFER: No. She really liked you.
DAVID: You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
JENNIFER: Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
DAVID: He looks at her amazedreliving the missed opportunity.
JENNIFER: Can I ask you a question?
DAVID: How come I'm still in black and white?
JENNIFER: How come I'm still in black and white?
DAVID: ( back to earth ) Well I've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I'm still like this. They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.
JENNIFER: Well I've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I'm still like this. They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.
DAVID: Oh, I don't know. Maybe . . it's not just the sex .
JENNIFER: ( looking up quickly ) She stares at him wide-eyed like someone who has just heard their name called. Jennifer's eyes dart around like she's calculating a math problem. After a moment or two, her expression changes: a vague look of recognition.
MARGARET: Um . You gotta turn off Main Street.
DAVID: Oh . Right. He looks over at her and smiles. Margaret turns on the radio.
DAVID: THEIR POV. LOVERS LANE. There, sitting in front of them, is a whole world gone Technicolor: THE LAKE IS BLUER THAN BLUE. THE WEEPING WILLOW IS GREENER THAN GREEN. THE DOGWOOD PETALS ( all "turned" now )
DAVID: What's that smell? Margaret looks at him and smiles. She leans well out of the convertible, and plucks a Gardenia from a bush that is blooming beside the car.
MARGARET: Aren't these great? David takes the flower, then puts it up to his nose. He takes a long deep breath then all at once, his posture seems to relax. As the fragrance enters his body his eyes drift like some strange narcotic is washing over him. David lowers the flower .
MR. JOHNSON: Oh, hi .
BETTY: ( turning to leave ) I'm sorry .
MR. JOHNSON: No, no . Come on in.
BETTY: I just thought . It's beautiful.
MR. JOHNSON: Their eyes lock for a second. Sort of a clutzy silence. Mr. Johnson motions toward his easel.
BETTY: I think it looks nice.
MR. JOHNSON: Well . Here's what it's s'posed to look like. He leads her over to the table and points down at the art book. It's open to a Cezanne that nearly burns off the page.
BETTY: Oh my .
MR. JOHNSON: Here. Look at this. He turns to Kandinskya massive swirl of color. The image is nearly electric.
BETTY: ( breathless ) Where'd you get this?
MR. JOHNSON: Bud brought it to me.
BETTY: MR. JOHNSON Here's my favorite.
MR. JOHNSON: Here's my favorite.
MR. JOHNSON: What do you think? She doesn't answer .
BETTY: ( faintly ) She's crying.
MR. JOHNSON: She's crying.
BETTY: She's crying.
MR. JOHNSON: No she's not.
BETTY: Yes she is. He looks up at her .
MR. JOHNSON: ( following her ) Wait .
BETTY: I've got to go .
MR. JOHNSON: It's alright. He stops her near the door and she turns her face toward the wall. Mr. Johnson touches her shoulder.
BETTY: ( shame ) No . He reaches up and gently touches her chin. Mr. Johnson moves around to glimpse the other side of her cheek.
MR. JOHNSON: It's beautiful.
MR. JOHNSON: ( a whisper ) . It's beautiful. She swallows, not sure what to do. Betty glances down.
LOVER.": She doesn't have enough light so Jennifer rises from the bed and crosses to "her" desk. She sits in the chair and flattens the book in front of her. Jennifer is deep into the plot and doesn't even look up as she flicks on the desk lamp. She could almost be studying algebra as she sits upright at the little desk.
JENNIFER: ( impressed ) She can see much clearer now. Jennifer folds her hands in front of her and doesn't even realize that she has mimicked the PHOTOGRAPH OF MARY SUE THAT SITS BESIDE HER IN A SILVER FRAME. The face is the same, but that's to be expected. So is the pony tail, the glasses, the posture and the studious look on her face. Jennifer turns the page engrossed in her novel when there is a loud TAP on the window. She rises from the desk and pulls back the curtain. Jennifer slides open the window.
BIFF: Mary SueC'mon .
JENNIFER: ( leaning out the window ) What are you doing?
BIFF: ( jiggling in anticipation ) It's six-thirty .
JENNIFER: We were gonna . You know . He jiggles some more.
BIFF: We were gonna . You know . He jiggles some more.
JENNIFER: ( remembering ) I can't.
BIFF: Why not? She glances down at her book.
JENNIFER: I'm busy.
BIFF: ( surprised ) With what?
JENNIFER: ( turning to Biff ) I'm studying. She thinks about it for a moment, then suddenly smiles. Biff stands dumbfounded on the sidewalk as Jennifer reaches up and quietly closes the window .
DAVID: ( inhaling ) Do they have those . Where you come Yeah . I guess. ( beat ) I don't know.
MARGARET: Do they have those . Where you come Yeah . I guess. I don't know.
DAVID: Yeah . I guess. I don't know.
MARGARET: You don't know? Margaret laughs like that isn't even possible. She shifts on the grass hiking her skirt up above the knee. It reveals a long tan leg beneath it. David watches as she kicks off her shoes, rubbing her feet through the long cool grass.
DAVID: ( a whisper ) Out there. She clings onto the words like they could transport her by themselves. David thinks for a moment.
MARGARET: ( a whisper ) Out there. She clings onto the words like they could transport her by themselves. David thinks for a moment.
DAVID: Oh. don't know . It's different. She leans forward.
MARGARET: Well it's louder . And scarier I guess . And . and a lot more dangerous .
DAVID: Well it's louder . And scarier I guess . And . and a lot more dangerous .
MARGARET: Sounds fantastic. You know some kids came up here the other night to go swimmingtook off all their clothes. She giggles. David looks at her in amazement.
DAVID: What's that like?
MARGARET: What's that like?
DAVID: Well it's big. And it's blue . . It's really really blue.
MARGARET: ( beat ) Boy. It's hot up here. Suddenly and without warning Margaret unbuttons her cardigan sweater. She slips it off, arching her back like the figurehead of a ship and David just stares at her breasts. She wears a light cotton blouse and even in the moonlight it forms a translucent silhouette . She lays the sweater across the grass and leans back on it.
DAVID: She unfolds a handkerchief revealing a handful of berries in
MARGARET: I picked them myself. They grow wild up here. Mmm. So sweet.
DAVID: ( looking at them ) They just grow like that?
MARGARET: ( looking straight up ) Oh yeah. There's a lot of stuff. Currants and strawberries . Here. I'll show you. She hops up and scampers across the grassy bank, kicking her heels behind her. Margaret reaches a tree in the distance and reaches toward an upper limb, stretching out her body like a piece of statuary. She picks a piece of fruit and scampers back toward him, hiking up her skirt as she goes .
MARGARET: Go on. Try it.
GEORGE: HoneyI'm home. There is no response. He looks a little perplexed but smiles as he calls out again:
BETTY: ( frightened ) What is that?
MR. JOHNSON: I don't know. Betty looks back at Mr. Johnson and suddenly sees the painting. She flinches for a second. Her eyes go wide.
MARGARET: What is that?
MARGARET: What's going on?
DAVID: Real rain?
MARGARET: Real rain?
DAVID: Yeah . You don't have rain either? She looks at him frightened. David smiles.
MARGARET: What do we do?
DAVID: ( reaching the car ) We'll just put up the top. He goes fishing around the boot of the car, looking for the catch to release it. David leans into the back seat fishing around as the rain starts to pound harder.
MARGARET: What top? He looks back at her. No top either. David smiles, drenched in rain and puts his arm around Margaret who is starting to It's fine. Come on. He leads her back to a thicket of bushes where several of the kids are clustered together. They look at one another, terrified, as they huddle for shelter beneath the ledge of an overhanging rock.
DAVID: It's fine. Come on. He leads her back to a thicket of bushes where several of the kids are clustered together. They look at one another, terrified, as they huddle for shelter beneath the ledge of an overhanging rock.
JENNIFER: Cool . She flops back down on the bed and continues to read .
GEORGE: ( a little frightened/ a little petulant ) Honey, I'm home . He still can't find her and he crosses into the DINING ROOM. The lights are dark there as well and he looks around ( baffled ) Where's my dinner? He sniffs a couple of times but there are no familiar cooking smells. George flings open the door to the kitchen but that's empty as well.
GEORGE: Where's my dinner .
GEORGE: ( insistent ) Where's my DINNER .
GEORGE: Where's my DINNER!
GEORGE: ( over the storm )
GEORGE: . WHERE'S MY DINNER! WHERE'S MY SERIES OF SHOTS. FOLLOWING GEORGE . He turns on Main Street and goes reeling past the insurance agency where he works. George howls into the wind and he passes the hardware store, the gas station, the bakery . Finally he pauses outside the barbershop. It's empty as well with the spinning barber pole being buffeted by the rain. George lowers his arms and just stares into the darkened shop. His voice grows quieter bewildered and shivering .
DINNER!: SERIES OF SHOTS. FOLLOWING GEORGE . He turns on Main Street and goes reeling past the insurance agency where he works. George howls into the wind and he passes the hardware store, the gas station, the bakery . Finally he pauses outside the barbershop. It's empty as well with the spinning barber pole being buffeted by the rain. George lowers his arms and just stares into the darkened shop. His voice grows quieter bewildered and shivering .
GEORGE: ( plaintively ) Where's my dinner? He wraps his arms around himself and shivers on the sidewalk.
BOB: What happened? He doesn't answer. George clutches his body and keeps The men stop bowling and rush to George's side. He blinks a couple of times, still soaked to the bone.
BOB: Are you alright? What is it?
GEORGE: ( faintly ) ( beat ) Real rain? George nods. Bob rushes to the glass door of the bowling alley and sees the driving storm. A huge fork of lightning lights up the sky.
BOB: ( beat ) Real rain? George nods. Bob rushes to the glass door of the bowling alley and sees the driving storm. A huge fork of lightning lights up the sky.
GEORGE: ( still shivering ) Well, I . I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home."
GEORGE: . Only no one was there. A MURMUR goes through the men.
BOB: ( gently/ the patriarch ) . It's gonna be fine George. George looks up at him helplessly. Bob pats him reassuringly on the back.
GUS: What do we do Bob?
BOB: Wellwe'll be safe for nowthank goodness we're in a bowling alley but if George here doesn't get his dinner, any one of us could be next. It could be you Gus, or you Burt, or even you Phil . They murmur again. Bob gathers a little steam.
PHIL: Couple of hours.
BOB: Gus, why don't you get a bunch of kids from the basketball team to help you put them up on lamposts and tree trunks . Gus nods. Big Bob turns to George and smiles. It's a warm, patriarchal smile. He claps a hand on George's shoulder.
MR. JOHNSON: You can't go out there.
BETTY: But I really should get home.
MR. JOHNSON: But you can't go out there. There is another fork of lightning and a booming peel of THUNDER. Betty sighs. She's past struggling. Betty shuts her eyes for a moment and listens to the rain pounding on the Sounds nice . Once you get used to it.
BETTY: Sounds nice . Once you get used to it.
MR. JOHNSON: ( listening ) Yeah. It does. There is another flash and a loud BOOM. Betty smiles this Like a drum.
BETTY: Like a drum.
MR. JOHNSON: ( thinks ) Or like sprinklers in the summer . Betty smiles. They both listen for a moment and the fear seems to fade a little. The RAIN POUNDS harder on the roof as Betty nestles down in the booth, a little closer to Mr. Johnson. They just sit there listening for a moment or two. Betty starts to smile .
MR. JOHNSON: ( seeing the rainbow ) Oh my Gosh .
MARGARET: ( awed ) Oh my God .
JENNIFER: ( looking at the rainbow ) Oh my God .
BOB: ( horrified ) Oh my GOD!
OF PLEASANTVILLE: ANGLE. DAVID. He looks up at it for a moment.
BETTY: I told you where I was.
GEORGE: All night?
BETTY: I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
GEORGE: ( the ultimate defense ) I was in a bowling-alley. Betty turnsglances out the window.
BETTY: I told you, George. I'm not going.
GEORGE: ( bigger smile ) Sure you are.
BETTY: No I'm not. She turns to face him. George flinches slightly.
GEORGE: It's fine. You'll put on some make up and .
BETTY: I don't want to put on some make up . George's eyes widen. It's a watershed moment.
GEORGE: ( protesting ) It goes away . It'll go away.
BETTY: ( gently ) I don't want it to go away. He suddenly squares back his shoulders and puffs out his ( the '50s patriarch ) Okaynow you listen to me . ( beat ) You're gonna come to this meeting and you're gonna put on this make up, and you're gonna come home at six o'clock every night and have dinner ready on this table.
GEORGE: ( the '50s patriarch ) Okaynow you listen to me . ( beat ) You're gonna come to this meeting and you're gonna put on this make up, and you're gonna come home at six o'clock every night and have dinner ready on this table.
BETTY: ( softly ) No I'm not sweetie. His expression leaves as quickly as it came. Betty moves closer to him.
GEORGE: Where are you gonna go?
BETTY: I'm gonna go now. She turns and starts out the kitchen door when George calls after her.
GEORGE: Betty, don't go out there like that! They'll see you! They'll SEE you! And she closes the door behind her.
BOB: This was found over in Dave Murphy's trash can. There were four of them like this . There is a murmur from the crowd .
BOB: Jane Davidson found these in her son's laundry basket. There is a LOUDER MURMUR. The crowd shifts in their seats. Bob points behind him to a BRIGHT GREEN lawn chair.
DAVID: ( softly ) I got you something. Margaret's eyes widen. She beams at him, then tears off the wrapping paper revealing a great big umbrella . a real umbrella. She looks up at him thrilled.
MARGARET: It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
DAVID: It was a prop for the school play . She looks down and giggles.
MARGARET: Can I open it?
DAVID: Sure . Margaret gives him a quick kiss then opens the umbrella. She puts it back on her shoulder and turns a series of pirouetteslike her own kind of rain dance. Margaret points her face up to the sky as if she is being showered by a summer storm. All at once a pair of HEADLIGHTS round the David grabs the umbrella and closes it quickly. Margaret looks to the street as the convertible slows to a crawl and two TEENAGE BOYS pull up beside them. They are clean cut with BLACK AND WHITE faces .
DRIVER: Hello Bud .
DAVID: ( clipped ) Hello Whitey. They smile at each other for no good reason. It's scary and ( more pointed ) Hello Margaret.
WHITEY: ( more pointed ) Hello Margaret.
MARGARET: Hello Whitey .
WHITEY: ( loud ) Hey Bud, how come you're not at the town meeting right now?
DAVID: ( curt ) No reason. ( pause/ firing back ) How come you're not?
WHITEY: Oh. We're s'posed to go out and let everybody know about it. See. He points to an ARMBAND that has some sort of Chamber of Commerce seal on it. Whitey leans out of the car and leers .
DAVID: Why don't you guys just get the hell out of here.
WHITEY: Oh, okay, Bud. We'll do that. He guns the engine as if to leave, then pauses and turns toward Margaret.
DAVID: It's fine . It doesn't mean anything. She nods, groping for reassurance .
WOMAN: Ed McFadden's got a blue front door.
ED MCFADDEN: It's always been blue!
WOMAN: Not that blue!
MAN: There's a big tree turning orange in Joe Baker's front yard!
BOB: People, people . I think we all know what's going on here.
BOB: Obviously certain "changes" have been happening. Up until now, things in Pleasantville have always been well . "Pleasant." And, recently, certain things have become . "Un-Pleasant." Now it seems to me the first thing we have to do is to separate out the things that are pleasant, from the things that are There is a loud murmur and nod of agreement .
"NO COLOREDS": SERIES OF SHOTS. SHOP WINDOWS. As the businesses are opened on Main Street, more and more "NO COLOREDS" signs appear in the windows: next to the donuts . by fishing poles . beside the stationery supplies . Everything else looks frighteningly the same.
DAVID: ( scared ) Ohwell .
NOW!: The sound reverberates like God Himself. David ducks inside the store, slamming the door behind him.
DAVID: ( terrified ) What do you mean?
DAVID: Lookit just sort of "happened" .
DAVID: I had nothing to do with that.
DAVID: Look .
DAVID: ( beat/ quietly ) . Only if they mean it. Dick Van Dyke looks at him for a beat, then goes "red" in the OKAY. NOW YOU'RE REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF! ( finding courage ) I didn't do anything wrong.
DAVID: ( finding courage ) I didn't do anything wrong.
PARADISE!: David just stares at the repeated images of Dick Van Dyke on the TV screens.
DAVID: DICK VAN DYKE Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
DAVID: No you're not.
EXCUSE ME?: ( gathering strength ) I'm sorry . I can't let you do that.
DAVID: ( gathering strength ) I'm sorry . I can't let you do that.
OW!: ( terrified ) I'm going to leave now.
DAVID: ( terrified ) I'm going to leave now.
DAVID: ( as scared as she is ) Come on! He plants his back foot primed for action. The crowd of black and white thugs just stares at it.
COME ON!: ANGLE. CROWD. They look at him warily. The boy reaches up and feels the side of his mouth where a trickle of RED BLOOD is running down his chin. He looks at his finger in horror and starts backing away.
DAVID: Get out of here! They back away further and David takes a threatening step. The boys turn and run as he turns back to face his "mother."
DAVID: Are you alright? She nods, still clutching her purse to her chest. David reaches out and touches her cheek when suddenly her eyes go CLOSER. STILL OVER DAVID'S SHOULDER. Betty reaches into her purse and pulls out her compact. She opens it, and holds it up to David, showing him the reflected image of his own face. AT LAST HE HAS TURNED TO COLOR.
DAVID: ( quietly ) Come on. He begins to lead her up toward the corner.
DAVID: Oh my God. He takes her in his arms and Margaret starts to sob. David strokes her hair.
BETTY: ( taking his arm ) No. Let's get out of here.
DAVID: We should be okay up here.
DAVID: ( a whisper ) We better go.
MARGARET: Where are they?
DAVID: I'm not sure. They head down Main St. and turn the comer on Walnut. All at once, a weird ORANGE LIGHT bathes the car .
DAVID: Oh my God.
JENNIFER: Don't! Just let go.
BIFF: It's better, Mary Sue.
JENNIFER: I said, NO! . I've read like one book in my whole life and I'll be damned if I let you throw it on that fire . Jennifer wrestles with him for a couple of seconds and then suddenly kicks Biff in the groin. He doubles over in agony when Jennifer snatches the book and bolts in the other DIFFERENT ANGLE. STREET. She sprints up the street and is just passing the barber shop when a hand reaches out and grabs her. Jennifer starts to scream but David puts a hand to her mouth.
DAVID: ( a whisper ) It's okay. It's me.
DAVID: Let's go inside.
DAVID: The SCRAPING SOUND stops. They all look to the open door and after a second or two, Mr. Johnson appears holding a broom and Betty runs across and throws her arms around him. The teenagers watch as she holds him tight.
MR. JOHNSON: Just thought I'd try to tidy it up a bit. Betty runs across and throws her arms around him. The teenagers watch as she holds him tight.
DAVID: Well he's right. Come on. Let's turn these booths back up. "Mary Sue", why don't you help me slide this in front of the door. We'll be okay in They respond to the tone of leadership. One by one the kids start to pitch in, sifting their way through the wreckage. Jennifer and David slide a barricade in front of the door as the kids try to put their shop back together.
BOB: This is not the answer people. The crowd quiets a bit. He leans over the lectern.
BOB: ( reading from the
BOB: "TWO: All citizens of Pleasantville are to treat one another in a courteous and "pleasant" manner ."
LISA ANNE: "Courteous and Pleasant manner." That doesn't sound too bad. David just looks at her then continues.
DAVID: ( reading from THE CODE ) "THREE: The area commonly known as Lover's Lane as well as the Pleasantville Public Library shall be closed until further notice." This sends a murmur amongst the kids.
VARIOUS KIDS: ( overlapping ) "Oh my gosh . No ." David holds up his hand.
DAVID: "FIVE: There shall be no public sale of umbrellas or preparation for inclement weather of any kind." Various glances dart back and forth between them. David "SIX: No bedframe or mattress may be sold measuring more than 38 inches wide." "SEVEN: The only permissible exterior paint colors shall be BLACK, WHITE or GRAY, despite the recent availability of certain alternatives." David looks over at Mr. Johnson who just winces slightly. Betty clutches his hand.
BOY: Hey. This thing works. He hits a button and BUDDY HOLLY's voice fills the soda shop. RAVE ON blares at almost top volume recalling a more festive Well all the things that you say and do Make me want to be with you-oo-oo .
BUDDY HOLLY: Well all the things that you say and do Make me want to be with you-oo-oo .
LISA ANNE: ( suddenly/ in a panic ) Turn that off! The boy looks back at her.
DAVID: Sure you are. He walks across the soda shop and plugs it back in. The kids watch spellbound at this personal display of defiance.
BUDDY HOLLY: The little things that you say and do Make we want to be with you-oo-oo . RAVE ON! It's a crazy feeling . RAVE ON! It's got me reelin' . Jennifer looks over at her brother with pride. Betty puts an arm around Mr. Johnson, feeling a little strongera little safer . The kids seem to relax a bit, and even if they don't feel totally reassured, at least they don't feel Twenty "colored" faces listen as Buddy Holly tells them RAVE ON. David stands beside the jukebox like a captain at the helm of his ship .
DAVID: ( whisper ) Stick together till you get off Main Street. They nod and head off down the block. David just watches them silently from the wreckage of the soda shop .
DAVID: It's okay. We'll get you a new one.
MR. JOHNSON: ( softly ) I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just don't know what I'd do .
DAVID: Maybe I have an idea.
BOB: ( bellowing ) Did you do this?
DAVID: ( quietly but clearly ) Yes I did. Bob grabs a copy of the Code of Conduct and waves it at him.
BOB: Do you know that it's illegal?
DAVID: ( thinks ) Yes I do. Bob looks dumbfounded. He tries to process the whole thing but just looks more confused. Bob runs his hand through his hair, shaking his head.
BOB: BUDWHY DID YOU DO THIS? Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
DAVID: Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
BOB: You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.
DAVID: Still doesn't make it right. There is some clapping from the back of the crowd. Bob's eyes widen. His face goes flushed ( darker gray ). A vein bulges in his neck. He turns to the police chief.
BOB: Dan! Arrest them!
BOB: What do you mean!?
DAN: Well, I never had to do it before.
BOB: You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
DAN: ( thinks ) Oh. guess I could do that, then.
DAVID: ( suddenly stronger ) C'mere, Dan. I'll help you. David walks toward the police chief and sticks his hands out. A louder murmur moves through the crowd as David actually helps him fasten on the cuffs. Mr. Johnson comes over to join them and the murmur starts to grow .
DAN: There's someone to see you Bud.
DAVID: I thought it might be you.
DAVID: I am actually . Glad to see you've finally shown your true colors. Dick Van Dyke gives a tight smile and shuts the door of the cell behind him.
DAVID: DICK VAN DYKE Because you're coming home.
DAVID: ( smiles ) Why don't you just take me back without it?
DAVID: So . I guess as long as I'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. We could have pink lawns and blue trees .
DAVID: I'm sorry. I can't do that. Dick Van Dyke takes a deep breath. He glances toward the barred window.
DAVID: They weren't my memories. I borrowed them. It's no good when you borrow them. Dick Van Dyke's eyes go wide and he literally starts to How long do you think you've been I don't know . Three, four weeks.
DAVID: ( warily ) I don't know . Three, four weeks.
DAVID: I'm going on trial tomorrow?
DAVID: ( stoicly ) There's worse places.
BOB: Bud Parker and William Johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of Conduct and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night of May 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following FORBIDDEN colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall: Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce, Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson, Yellow, Olive and Magenta.
DAVID: Um . Yes I do. Where's our We prefer to keep these proceedings as "pleasant" as possible. I don't think a lawyer will be necessary. There is a murmur and a great deal of nodding amongst the black and white faces. Big Bob smiles to himself then Do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness?
BOB: We prefer to keep these proceedings as "pleasant" as possible. I don't think a lawyer will be necessary. There is a murmur and a great deal of nodding amongst the black and white faces. Big Bob smiles to himself then Do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness?
DAVID: Wellit was dark out .
BOB: Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
DAVID: It was accessible to everyone.
BOB: Very well. Let the record show that the defendants have answered in the affirmative to all the He looks directly at them for the first time.
MR. JOHNSON: I didn`t mean to hurt anybody. I just have to paint . I need to. He gropes for something else to say, but what else is there? David glances over and sees him sit slowly back in his seat. David rises from his chair.
DAVID: I think I've got something to say.
BOB: Very well . David looks out over the audience. After a moment or two, he looks back at Big Bob.
DAVID: I think I know why you're doing this. I mean, I understand why you're doing this. I used to feel the same way. I used to want this place to stay just the way it was. I never wanted it to change . There is a loud MURMUR. Big Bob bangs the gavel.
BOB: ( leaning forward ) The basketball team?
DAVID: Sure. Everybody's upset because they're not winning anymorebut just think how it would feel if all of a sudden they do win. There's a murmur in the gallery.
BOB: Okaythat's enough!
DAVID: I thought I was allowed to defend myself.
BOB: You're not allowed to lie.
DAVID: I'm not lying . Here I'll show He turns suddenly toward the jury box.
MR. SIMPSON: What color is that hedge of yours?
DAVID: What color is that hedge of yours?
MR. SIMPSON: No, not that hedge. The other one.
DAVID: No, not that hedge. The other one.
MR. SIMPSON: The other one?
DAVID: The one in your mind. The one that you see on a bright cold morning. The one that you see when you walk in front of your house and you just stand there and stare. Mr. Simpson suddenly looks far away. He gets a kind of dreamy look in his eye.
BOB: I said, that's enough!
THE AUDIENCE: "No . Let him finish . Go on ." Big Bob lifts the gavel and is about to bang it when David suddenly turns toward George.
DAVID: Alright. Dad .
GEORGE: ( solemn ) Yes Bud.
DAVID: ( beat ) Don't you miss her?
DAVID: I mean, of course you do, but it isn't just the cooking or the cleaning that you missit's something else, isn't it . George swallows. The UNDERTONE in the room starts to grow as he glances toward the back of the room.
BIG BOB: ( BANGING the gavel loudly ) Okay, that's IT!!!
DAVID: ( motioning toward the back ) Now don't you think she looks just as pretty in color? Don't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her? Slowly, almost imperceptibly George nods. A single tear rolls down his cheek. As it traces the side of his face it leaves a long trail of COLOR behind it.
BOB: ( POUNDING the gavel )
DAVID: Why am I out of order?
BOB: BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS! Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either. David motions behind him to the black and white section. There are now ten to fifteen "colored" faces.
DAVID: Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either. David motions behind him to the black and white section. There are now ten to fifteen "colored" faces.
BOB: THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE. But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.
DAVID: But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.
BOB: ( tightly ) It's not in ME.
DAVID: Oh sure it is.
BOB: No it isn't. He crosses to the bench looking right up at Big Bob. He leans over the bench and gets right up in his face.
DAVID: ( smug whisper ) What do you want to do to me right now? Big Bob starts to tremble. He shakes with rage as David moves C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner hell, you could have a flood any minute . Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked .
BIG BOB: That's not going to happen!
DAVID: But it could happen.
BIG BOB: No it couldn't! Big Bob looks at David and starts to tremble. It starts around the base of his neck, spreads quickly up the rest of his head. After a moment or two, Big Bob has gone completely
JENNIFER: Uch . I am like gonna hurl . David turns and looks at her. Both of them laugh. David throws his arms around his sister as more and more people stream out of the courtroom into the sunlight .
DAVID: Are you sure?
JENNIFER: I told you. I'm like positive.
DAVID: This thing works. We could go home right now.
JENNIFER: I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.
JENNIFER: Besides. You think there's like a chance I'm gonna get into college back there?
DAVID: ( thinks . ) Honestly . no. They both smile.
JENNIFER: Right here.
DAVID: And you're sure about this?
JENNIFER: I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old. David nods.
DAVID: I'll come back and check on you in a month. Jennifer nods and gives him a hug. She holds on tight for a couple of seconds.
JENNIFER: You're like the coolest brother in the world. David smiles. Never been called cool before. They suddenly hear the SOUND of a motor and look to their left. A huge Greyhound bus lumbers up the highway, pulling to a halt at the sign. The doors open beckoning her in. Jennifer smiles at her brother, then turns toward the door .
MARGARET: You're gonna forget about me.
DAVID: No I won't. I swear. Margaret nods. She looks at him for a moment then wraps her arms around his neck. They meet in a long, rich, wet, soft kiss. The umbrella falls to the ground .
MARGARET: ( a whisper ) I like calling you David.
DAVID: I like it too.
MR. JOHNSON: Well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was?
DAVID: You're gonna keep painting aren't Mr. Johnson nods.
MR. JOHNSON: ( remembering something ) ( reaching into his pocket ) I've got something for you. He pulls out a folded piece of paper. Mr. Johnson extends it to David who unfolds it and instantly smiles.
DAVID: It's beautiful.
MR. JOHNSON: Just a littleYou know. David looks up at him and smiles. All at once he glances toward the door.
BETTY: ( extending the bag ) I made you these for the trip. They're marshmallow rice squares.
DAVID: Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna .
BETTY: ( painful/ quieter ) I had to say goodbye. She looks up at David and their eyes lock. Betty hands him the bag.
DAVID: I won't.
BETTY: ( voice quivering ) And . wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
DAVID: ( nodding ) . It's a pretty short trip. She nods as well. Betty puts the sweater around his shoulders anyway and fusses with the collar for a second or two. Then she throws her arms around his neck.
BETTY: I'm so proud of you, Bud.
DAVID: Thanks . I love you.
BETTY: I love you too. She clings on tight for a second or two then lets go. Betty flicks away a tear and draws a deep breath.
DAVID: You better stand back a little. Betty and Mr. Johnson cross toward the comer of the room. David points the remote at the TV .
