PUBLIC ENEMIES: Written by
PONTIAC: is parked at the curb. It waits.
HAMILTON: Thirty year old JOHN HERBERT DILLINGER is in the backseat. He nods. His arms are behind him. We don't know why. Red starts the car and drives forward.
CONVICTS: Its cold.-Convicts' uniforms are broadly striped and frayed. This is a line of hard men branded by prison: shorn hair, broken nose, eyes with a cold ferocity. And their aggression has a nihilistic edge; their spirits never surrender. There's nothing beaten down about these men. Like Alcatraz, Leavenworth, and Sing Sing, this is the end of the line.
PRISON GUARDS: in visored black caps, black shirts, black patent leather Sam Browne belts with three-foot long billy clubs watch the line, poised to unleash violence.
THESE THREE: with an older man, WALTER DIETRICH, wait for the lam. work call to the prison Shirt Factory.
TURNKEY: ( opening up ) Hamilton flashes the badge. He shoves Dillinger inside. In an adjacent room FIVE GUARDS play poker. Next to them is a barred entrance to the prison yard. As the cage door locks behind him, this is the last place Dillinger wants to have entered. Meanwhile.
BOXES: and bolts of fabric wait for the convicts. lam. A KLAXON sounds. Door opens. Convicts enter. Walter Dietrich goes right to the stacks and pulls a box with an "X" crayoned on the side. Its labeled "Thread." ( Dietrich was mentored by Herbert K. Lamm, an ex-Prussian soldier who invented professional bank robbery by applying military tactics and who rode with Butch & Sundanc4's Hole in the Wall Gang in Utah in 1901. in prison Dietrich passed on Lamm's techniques. His brightest student in 1933 is..'ohn Herbert Dillinger. )
GUARD DAINARD: is approached by Pierpont, who shoves the 45 in his face.
PIERPONT: Line up! Line up. Dietrich and Van Meter control THREE OTHER GUARDS. ED SHOUSE, JIM LESLIE and EARL ADAMS - three other Cons armed with makeshift clubs and spivs join the escape. Meanwhile.
TURNKEY: Didn't you get paroled out of here a few months ago?
DILLINGER: Yes, sir. Three months ago.
TURNKEY: . John. Johnnie Dillinger?
DILLINGER: That's right. But my friends call me "Johnnie". You gotta address me as "Mister" Dillinger. Dillinger's insubordination puzzles Turnkey so he doesn't see Hamilton bat a Thompson submachine gun across the back of his head and swing it onto the Two Guards.
YARD GATE: is keyed open by Dainard followed by Pierpont and Makley and the others. Pierpont kicks over the poker table. Escapees throw all the Guards against the wall.
DILLINGER: at the window checks the escape route to the Pontiac. Its Hamilton conceals his weapon and starts out. Smooth. He crosses the front lawn, the street car tracks. So far, so INT. GATE HOUSE - GUARDS undress. One takes his time.
SHOUSE: Hurry up! C'mon!
PIERPONT: Cut it out Shouse!
DILLINGER: ( turns from open door ) Dainard thinks that once the killing's begun, he will die. So, he grabs for Homer Van Meter's .45. Van Meter SHOOTS Dainard. Dainard's knocked to the floor. Blood pools. A SIREN SCREAMS.
DILLINGER: arrives, takes Red's position. Red goes for the Pon,.c.
ESCAPEES: don't complete their disguises. Half-dressed in gua ds' uniforms, they crash outside.
PIERPONT' S: running with the older Dietrich across the grass FIRING his
BANG!: Dietrich is hit in the neck by rifle FIRE from the East Dillinger falls away. Dillinger and Pierpont grab Walter's arms. He's-paralyzed now. They try to pull him onto the running boafd, of the moving car. Dietrich's"hcpeful eyes look up at them. Then his eyes glaze over. His feet drag down the street. He's dead and they know it. They let go.
DILLINGER: Dillinger falls away. Dillinger and Pierpont grab Walter's arms. He's-paralyzed now. They try to pull him onto the running boafd, of the moving car. Dietrich's"hcpeful eyes look up at them. Then his eyes glaze over. His feet drag down the street. He's dead and they know it. They let go.
DILLINGER: Walter's dead 'cause you screwed it up, you son of a bitch!
SHOUSE: The bastard wouldn't do what he was told, Johnny. .Pete? Homer?
VAN METER: Let him have it.
PIERPONT: Dietrich was your pal, up to you. Dillinger sees the abject fear in Shouse's eyes. And Dillinger's mood swings. He lowers the shotgun. Then, he snaps the butt across Shouse's face. Breaks Shouse's cheekbone. Dillinger pulls back and slams the heavy butt dead center, smashing Shouse's nose and orbital socket. Dillinger opens the door and kicks Shouse out of the moving car.
PIERPONT: ( ready to go ) EXT. FARM A TODDLER wearing a torn smock approaches the Pontiac and a second car, a dust-covered Plymouth parked behind it.
HAMILTON: ( from the house ) Johnny.? Ready.
THE WOMAN: brings out the dozen fried egg sandwiches wrapped in newspaper. She looks 40 but is 20. Edwin Norris is at the ( takes two ) Thank you, ma'am. Dillinger's lopsided smile is charming.
DILLINGER: ( takes two ) Thank you, ma'am. Dillinger's lopsided smile is charming.
EDWIN NORRIS: Its Miss. She's my daughter, Viola. That'll be eight dollars. Viola retrieves her toddler brother who's crawled into the Pontiac. Dellinger peels off a $20 bill.
DILLINGER: Well, then you keep the change. $12 is a lot''of money in 1933. Grateful, Norris goes inside, Dillinger passes Viola and the struggling toddler on the way to the Pontiac,
VIOLA: ( LOW ) Take me with you, mister. She puts a hand on his forearm.
DILLINGER: I'm sorry, honey.
HAMILTON: Kid didn't fool with anything, did he? Dillinger, looking back at the boy, hasn't heard.
DILLINGER: Its all here.
PURVIS: breaks into the clear.
PURVIS: Floyd! Halt! Purvis aims the Mauser. Perfect form. Floyd zigzags. Purvis FIRES, misses. Floyd opens up with the Thompson wildly at that range. Floyd is 10 yards from the forest. Purvis kneels onto his right knee. On his upraised left knee he braces hi left elbow. He inhales. Starts a smooth squeeze. Ha Tway through the exhale he FIRES. Floyd's right arm flies up. He's punched forward and crashes to the ground.
FLOYD: regains consciousness. Purvis is running in. Floyd`s left hand pulls a 45.
BAUM: Look out, Melvin! Purvis kicks the 45 out of his hand.
PURVIS: You are under arrest. Floyd sits up to see the massive exit wound. His right lung and liver are shot through. He falls back.
FLOYD: ( RASPS ) I'm Floyd. Who are you?
PURVIS: Melvin Purvis - Department of ( MORE ) ( CONTINUED ) PURVIS ( CONT'D ) ( BEAT ) Where's your friend Harry Campbell, Ain't gonna tell you shit. Floyd looks at the sky.
FLOYD: Ain't gonna tell you shit. Floyd looks at the sky.
SPORT: He jus' pulled in.
CAROLE: Dillinger cradles the Thompson in his arm and crosses to her.
DILLINGER: ( to Hamilton ) Hey, Red, call Oscar.
HAMILTON: Okay. And Berman? Wanna switch-out the ( ADDS ) Get a Chrysler and an Essex. ( to Carole ) Hey, doll. He half picks her up with one arm around her waist.
DILLINGER: ( ADDS ) Get a Chrysler and an Essex. ( to Carole ) Hey, doll. He half picks her up with one arm around her waist.
CAROLE: I sure did.
JAN METER: Where those gals?! As Homer and Pierpont head inside.
DILLINGER: ( re main spring ) Jammed twice, Oscar., .main spring's too cut off one coil.
OSCAR: cut off one coil.
DILLINGER: And it rides up and to the right on full ( re Cutts compensator ) I widen port.
OSCAR: ( re Cutts compensator ) I widen port.
PIERPONT: Hiya Harry.
PIERPONT: tosses Berman a rubber banded roll of bills while.
ZARKOVIOH: Johnny! How are ya? With him is ANNA SAGE, a 40 year old well-dressed madam. She kisses Johnny on the cheek.
DILLINGER: Good and so are you. Christmas is coming early this year. ( fat envelope of cash ) Extra cake's in here for you and Anna.
ANNA SAGE: I'm in Chicago on North Halstead now. Come on by.
DILLINGER: Marty, tell me that me and my boys are Long as you stay in my town, you're in safe haven. Dillinger tosses Marty the envelope. This is Dillinger's support and resupply network.
ZARKOVICH: Long as you stay in my town, you're in safe haven. Dillinger tosses Marty the envelope. This is Dillinger's support and resupply network.
CAROLE: Wanna go out later, sugar?
DILLINGER: I want to sit here with you and listen to the radio, baby.
MCKELLAR: ( to Hoover ) Why do we need this?
HOOVER: Because of the new breed of mobile outlaws who flee jurisdiction by crossing state lines over highways and against whom this government must wage a war on J. EDGAR HOOVER is a physically short man but has a dynamic presence. He is a dapper patrician who believes in elites. He is completely free from self-doubt. He is youthful and 33 years old. SUYDAM and TOLSON sit next to him. MCKELLAR iï¿½'Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Sub- Committee.-,He's an avuncular man of 62.
MCKELLAR: And so in the middle of a Great Depression you're looking for a budget increase to build up your Department? But by my tally your Department of Investigation spends more taxpayer's dollars catching crooks than what the crooks you catch stole in the first That's ridiculous. The Bureau's apprehended kidnappers, bank robbers, who have stolen up to.
HOOVER: That's ridiculous. The Bureau's apprehended kidnappers, bank robbers, who have stolen up to.
MCKELLAR: ( looking at document ) How many criminals you apprehended?
HOOVER: We've arrested and arraigned 213 wanted No. I mean you. How many?
MCKELLAR: No. I mean you. How many?
HOOVER: As Director I've administered.
MCKELLAR: No. How many have you arrested? I've never arrested anybody.
HOOVER: I've never arrested anybody.
MCKELLAR: ( INCREDULOUS ) You never arrested anybody?
HOOVER: I'm an administrator.
MCKELLAR: With no field experience. For once Hoover is silent.
HOOVER: Crime is what runs wild in this country, Mr. Chairman. And.
MCKELLAR: And if the country required an expanded Bureau, I question you are the person most fit to run it while.
HOOVER: ( EXPLODES ) I won't be judged by a kangaroo court of venal politicians.
MCKELLAR: ( slams gavel! ) While outlaws like Dillinger, Clyde Barrow, the Barkers, and Nelson flourish ( SLAM ) Your appropriation request is denied. The hearing's over.
HOOVER: ( to Suydam ) Find out: was he soft on the Reds in ,1919? Does he use prostitutes? Peppy `tuf f like that. And feed this to Walter =!riiâinchell: "McKellar's a Neanderthal. He's O7:a personal vendetta to destroy me." Like that.
TOLSON: Spotted in Hammond, Indiana.
HOOVER: How long ago?
TOLSON: Yesterday. Another sighting has him on the Lincoln Highway in Ohio heading towards Cincinnati.
HOOVER: ( DECIDES ) He's in Hammond. Heading to Chicago.
SUYDAM: How do you know?
HOOVER: You can have fun in Chicago. What the hell's there to do in Cincinnati?
HOOVER: ( suddenly brilliant ) Agent Purvis, congratulations.
PURVIS: Thank you sir. May I ask why?
HOOVER: Pretty Boy Floyd, for which you have my commendation and personal gratitude. Second, you are, as of this moment, the Special Agent in Charge of the Chicago field office. Your task will be to get John Dillinger. Are you up to it?
PURVIS: Absolutely, sir. Purvis is imbued. Henry Suydam enters.
SUYDAM: ( to Hoover ) They're ready for him.
HOOVER: ( PENSIVE ) This is Henry Suydam.. He is our expert in congressional and press relations. INT. BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION w HOOVER ESCORTS PURVIS THROUGH
TOLSON: hurry down the staircase.
HOOVER: ( LOW ) Why are you sure you're up to this task, Mr. Purvis?
PURVIS: We have two weapons that cannot be What are they?
HOOVER: What are they?
PURVIS: The Bureau's modern techniques of investigation and your visionary You let Mr. Tolson, here, know if you need anything, Melvin, anything at all,
HOOVER: You let Mr. Tolson, here, know if you need anything, Melvin, anything at all,
PURVIS: Thank you.
HOOVER: ( brilliant smile ) Call me J.E. They shake hands. There's a mob of photographers and newsmen and microphones to interview him.
SUYDAM: ( quietly to Tolson ) Our own Clark Gable.
DILLINGER: Let's play a game, Mr. President. Its called spin the dial. ( starts stopwatch, shouts to
CREW ): Seven minutes! Dillinger is the Vault Man. And alarm sounds.
MANLEY: is at the tellers' drawers. His job is to shovel cash into a canvas bag. The Tellers stand aside.
DILLINGER`S: at the vault with Weyland. Weyland hesitates. Dillinger's right hand with the Thompson covers Tellers so Makley can work. His left hand draws one of the two 45s he keeps in twin shoulder holsters and he cracks Grover Weyland across the forehead. He aims the .45 between Weyland's eyes.
DILLINGER: ( CALM ) You can be a dead hero or a live coward.
PIERPONT: ( CALMLY ) NO ONE inside stops working. They know Van Meter will do his EXT. BANK - OFFICER CHESTER BOYARD is out of the car and into the bank door, passing right by -
VAN METER: who let him go. Van Meter keeps his eye on the other THREE COPS. Two get behind the cover of parked cars across the street. ONE stays low and runs towards Homer.
BOYARD: ( CONFIDENTLY ) Hold it! Hands up! PIERPONT, behind him, slams the butt of the Thompson into the back of his head, knocking him flat, and disarms him. He rouses. Pete doesn't like authority. Pete hits him again. Blood pools onto the floor. A WOMAN faints, collapsing. Peters dead calm. He looks over the half-painted windows. The growing crowd on the sidewalk is getting too large.
HE FIRES: at the glass. People scramble for cover as it CRASHES onto Main Street. Meanwhile.
COP: ( to Homer ) Hey, you. Move out of there!
VAN METER: Why should I? I wanna watch. Angry Cop rushes him. Homer slams him in the gut with his rifle, disarms him and uses him as a shield. He backs to the front door. Pedestrians flee. Cops draw down. They cannot shoot without Homer blowing off the Cop's head. Meanwhile.
DILLINGER: That your money there, mister?
FARMER: Yessir. It is.
DILLINGER: Well, go ahead and put it away. We're here for the bank's money. Not your Customers appreciate Dillinger. Dillinger loves their- You three! Let's go! .to three pretty TELLERS hiding under a desk.
PIERPONT: You three! Let's go! .to three pretty TELLERS hiding under a desk.
DILLINGER: Folks, stay calm and stay low. Pierpont grabs two; Dillinger takes one, creating a human shield around them
CITY DETECTIVES: pull up in front of Wylie's Hat shop. Dillinger's crew is crossing fast to Red's Buick, as.
VAN METER: FIRES past his hostage's head. Detective goes down. The Hostage's eardrum is blown. His ear bleeds.
PIERPONT: C'mere, honey. Buick's moving faster. Dillinger pulls her onto the running board next:o Boyard. The Buick roars away.
MAKLEY: 2 miles - turn left at the white barn. Pierpont breaks out the rear window. He throws two five gallon milk jars full of roofing nails out into the road. They scatter.
DILLINGER: ( to Boyard and two of the
HOSTAGES ): Okay. Beat it!
DILLINGER: sees Anna Patzke's shivering from shock and the cold. He puts his coat on her. He plops his hat on her head, too.
VAN METER: ( OMINOUS ) Are we taking `em to the hideout?
DILLINGER: ( going along with it That depends.
VAN METER: How 'bout it, honey? Can you cook?
ANNA PATZKE: ( not disinterested ) Uh. Sure. After a fashion. They start to hoot and laugh. They think this is hÂ±l iiou.s.
VAN METER: When I'm not doing this, I'm a scout for the movies.
ANNA PATZKE: This makes them laugh even harder.
PIERPONT: Face each other. Join hands. Pierpont binds them loosely to the tree.
WEYLAND: We'll freeze.
DILLINGER: You'll worm your way out of that in about ten minutes. Anna looks over at Dellinger.
WARREN BARTON: holds up the coat Dillinger left on Anna Patzke.
BAUM: .manufactured by Freeman St. Louis. We are identifying all stores that sold this coat. We note AGENTS COWLEY, RICE, CLEGG + RORER. DORIS ROGERS ( 23 ) is Purvis' secretary. He brought her from his last post in Alabama along with Barton and Baum. We've entered mid-scene.
PURVIS: Then we will cross-reference every Dillinger family member and known associate in each locale.
DILLINGER: Hiya, Alvin. You hungry? How's Freddie and Dock? ( note: Alvin Karpis is cunning and careful. He will outlive everyone, including J. Edgar Hoover, and retire to Torremolinos, Spain, where he will die of heart failure in
KARPIS: Everyone's good. ( leans in; they talk quietly ) We been looking to snatch two fellas. One's a St. Paul banker, Ed Bremer. Need a few more hands.
DILLINGER: Don't like kidnapping.
KARPIS: Robbing banks is getting tougher.
DILLINGER: The public don't like kidnappers.
KARPIS: Who gives a damn what the public likes?
DILLINGER: I do. I hide out among them.
KARPIS: ( SHRUGS ) ,L -am strictly out to make cake.
DILLINGER: .: yeah, then you, Ma, Dock and Freddie hole up like hermits on farms for six months. I grew up on a goddamn farm. I hate farms. I like big cities, crowds and a good time.
DILLINGER: Say, by the way, if someone got pinched here, who can get'em out real fast?
KARPIS: Lawyer named Piquett. We all use him. ( writes a phone number )
DILLINGER: What about this train?..
KARPIS: Needs two, three more months to set up. I need seven or eight real right guys to take it down.
DILLINGER: ( SMILES ) Sounds like Jesse James.
KARPIS: ( LOW ) A million seven, a million eight. Dillinger looks at Karpis. In 2007, that would be $22 KARPIS ( CONT' D ) Federal Reserve shipment. It runs only twice a month. This is the kind of score you go away on after.
DILLINGER: Where you gonna go?
KARPIS: Brazil. Cuba, maybe. What about you?
DILLINGER: Were having too good a time today. We ain't worryin' about tomorrow yet.
KARPIS: You ought to. What we're doin' here, don't last forever. They lock at each other: two pros at the top of their game.
DILLINGER: Keep me in mind on the train. Karpis leaves. Dellinger can't see Billie anymore.
JA' METER: ( AGITATED ) Let's snatch Bremer.
P IERPONT: Shut your yap, Homer.
MAKLEY: Let's get our of here. Pierpont, Homer and Makley leave.
DILLINGER: Homer stayin' steady?
HAMILTON: ( reading his mind ) He's okay.
DILLINGER: Three rules I learned from Walter Dietrich. One: never work with people who are desperate. Two: never work with people who aren't the best. Three: never work when you're not ready. Billie reappears, dancing with a young man.
HAMILTON: Well, I got rule four: stay away from Without women, I might as well have `stayed in stir. Anna Sage approaches with a young girl for Red.
DILLINGER: Without women, I might as well have `stayed in stir. Anna Sage approaches with a young girl for Red.
HAMILTON: What's why they invented whores. ( getting up ) Hamilton leaves, arms around the women. Dillinger keeps his eye on Billie. Music ends. Young man escorts her to her table. He tries to join her. She turns him down. Dillinger finishes his drink, approaches. He now sees how beautiful Billie is. She's 5 foot 5. With a straight erect build, she stands out in any crowd. She looks Dillinger straight in the eye. Clear skin, dark eyes with humor playing about the edges. He unexpectedly starts to feel nervous. He gives her his best grin.
DILLINGER: I don't know what you said to your friend, but I sure am glad you did. Billie looks him over: a well-made man in a good suit with a great smile. And, paradoxes: he easily talks to women but he's not a hustler. He's young, but there's a world of experience in his face. Open, but he's holding something ( CONTINUED ) CONTINUED: ( 4 ) What's your name?
BILLIE: Billie Frechette.
DILLINGER: Buy you a drink? Billie looks at her girlfriend, she nods, Billie rises. As they cross to the bar.
BILLIE: On my father's side. There's an "e" at the end. Do you have a name?
DILLINGER: Jack Harris. Music changes to "Bye Bye Blackbird."
BILLIE: Do you dance, Jack?
DILLINGER: I don't know how. She smiles a pretty smile at him.
BILLIE: How come you don't know how to dance? Its easy. Follow me. This is a two-step. ( he stares at her feet ) Don't look at my feet. Look at my She stays an inch or two distant in his arms. Its slow and languorous. He follows her with little difficulty. He can smell the perfume in her black hair.
TORCH SINGER: ( SINGS ) âPack-up all my cares and woe Here I go, singing low Bye, bye blackbird"
DILLINGER: My, but you are pretty.
BILLIE: Where's Flandreau.?
DILLINGER: Where's Flandreau.?
TORCH SINGER: ( SINGS ) "Where somebody waits for me Sugar's sweet, so is she Bye, bye blackbird."
BILLIE: outh Dakota.
DILLINGER: Father's French, what's on the other From South Dakota, Indian's likelier than She looks at him.
BILLIE: From South Dakota, Indian's likelier than She looks at him.
DILLINGER: From South Dakota, Indian's likelier than She looks at him.
BILLIE: My momma's a Menominee Indian. But most men don't like that.
DILLINGER: I'm not most men.
BILLIE: And I check coats at the Steuben Club. What do you do, Jack?
DILLINGER: I'm catching up.
BILLIE: Catching up on what?
DILLINGER: On life, meeting someone like you. ( her hair ) Dark, beautiful, like the black bird in that song. She laughs at the flattery. Holds his eyes a beat with an ironic look. A couple from another group looks at Dillinger. He's cool. He returns the look. They look away.
BILLIE: He nods courteously to her girlfriends, grabs her coat, puts a hand around Billie's waist and steers her out.
TORCH SINGER: ( SINGS ) "So make my bed and light the light Cause I'll be home late tonight Bye, bye blackbird. ."
DILLINGER: What are you gonna have?
BILLIE: What is it, exactly, you do for a living? Dillinger looks over the top of his menu.
DILLINGER: Well.I rob banks. Then he leans back in his chair and regards her.
BILLIE: Why'd you tell me that? You could have made up a story.
DILLINGER: 'Cause I can't lie to you. she studies him carefully.
BILLIE: ;,;.at's a pretty serious thing to say to a woman you just met.
DILLINGER: I feel like I know you.
BILLIE: Well, I haven't been any of the places you've been. So I don't even know what I don't know.
DILLINGER: Some of the places I been ain't so hot. Where I'm going is a lot better. Wanna come along?
BILLIE: Boy, you are in a hurry.
DILLINGER: If you were looking at what I am looking at, honey, you'd be in a hurry too. She laughs at his flattery, which she is also finding ( CONTINUED ) CONTINUED: ( 2 ) ( leans in ) Well, its me they're looking at this That's 'cause you're beautiful. A blonde woman, elegant and ice cold, stares at Billie, a Depression-era child in her dress.
BILLIE: ( leans in ) Well, its me they're looking at this That's 'cause you're beautiful. A blonde woman, elegant and ice cold, stares at Billie, a Depression-era child in her dress.
DILLINGER: That's 'cause you're beautiful. A blonde woman, elegant and ice cold, stares at Billie, a Depression-era child in her dress.
BILLIE: That's nice. But they're looking at me because they're not used to having a Menominee Indian girl in their restaurant in a three dollar dress.
DILLINGER: ( takes her hand ) Listen, doll, that's 'cause they're all about where people come from. Only thing important is where somebody's going.
BILLIE: Where are you going?
DILLINGER: To the top. He's irresistible.
CATENA: ( WHISPERED ) Hey Johnny.: Dillinger reacts, changes down, says coldly.
DILLINGER: ( to Billie ) Go wait outside. I'll be right there. Billie turns and walks out of the restaurant.
CATENA: Real good. I work for Mr. Nitti now. Been with him since I got out of Michigan. Catena indicates FRANK NITTI ( 47 ) in a group at a table. Sober and educated, Nitti glances in their direction but has no interest.
DILLINGER: Looks like a barber.
CATENA: Don't go by looks.
D'ANDREA: ( smiles, low ) Everytime I read about one of your jobs, where you give people back their money, 'You crack me up.
DILLINGER: See you. Gilbert.
CATENA: Good luck Johnnie.
BAUM: That noise on the line? That's called "swing". Nothing we can do about it. Some words get dropped. Were listening in on a car dealer. Harry Berman. Rice plays back a recording.
BAUM: We think that's Dillinger's voice.
PURVIS: How did we find Berman?
BAUM: Dillinger's coat was bought in Cicero, Illinois, a few doors from Berman's dealership. Berman supplies cars to the syndicate. Since Capone. Dillinger must have been at Berman's switching cars when he bought that coat.
BILLIE: ( without looking up ) May I check your coat, sir?
DILLINGER: No, honey. You go get your coat. She looks up. So does May. May flashes Billie a look: if you don't want him, I do.
MAY MINCZELES: Sounds good to me. Dillinger has eyes only for Billie.
DILLINGER: You ran out on me.
BILLIE: `you left me standing alone on the I 'you're going to be my girl, you have swear you'll never do that again.
DILLINGER: I 'you're going to be my girl, you have swear you'll never do that again.
BILLIE: I'm not your girl! A CUSTOMER comes up and puts his ticket on the counter.
CUSTOMER: Brown overcoat.
BILLIE: ( ignoring customer ) I am not your girl and I'm not going to say that.
DILLINGER: I'm waiting.
CUSTOMER: So am I.
BILLIE: Well, I will never run out on you. And that's a promise.
DILLINGER: Well, I will never run out on you. And that's a promise.
CUSTOMER: Well, I want to run out of here. So, lady, will you get my coat.? Dillinger lifts the man two feet off the floor and slams him into the wall. Real jailhouse rage. The lethally cold eyes tells the customer everything he needs to know. Dillinger swings him to the counter, grabs the man's ticket, slams thru the half door, finds the man's coat, tosses it at him.
DILLINGER: Keep the tip. ( to Billie ) You ain't getting other people's hats and coats no more either. He takes her coat and holds it for her. She doesn't move.
BILLIE: No one's ever done that for me before.
DILLINGER: You're with me now.
BILLIE: I don't know anything about you.
DILLINGER: I was raised on a farm in Mooresville, Indiana. My ma died when I was three. My daddy beat the hell out of me because he didn't know no better way to raise me. I used to do dumb things but I'm a lot smarter now. I like baseball, movies, good clothes, fast cars, and you. What else do you need to know? She gets into her coat. Dillinger opens the door for her. They exit, watched by May.
BILLIE: You been living here long?
DILLINGER: Yeah. Since yesterday. From a back bedroom ( Red's ) a phonograph is louder as a door opens and Red enters the kitchen in a robe for a drink. He returns. Laughter. Dillinger has the boxes and drinks.
BILLIE: I'm drinking in a man's apartment who .:W.ants to romance me. Okay. I'm no "Pollyanna, but there are things that you Kati would bother a girl like me.
DILLINGER: We`rob banks `cause banks is where they keep the money. I can make 500 dollars in a year or I can make ten thousand dollars in a morning. I'll take my chances on the bank. No apologies. We don't go lookin' to hurt anybody. But if somebody gets in our way, that's gotta be their problem. That what you want to know?
BILLIE: I'm trying to get to know you.
DILLINGER: You want to get to know me?
BILLIE: Egyptian cotton. Since we been out I go for the finest stuff. As much as I can get, as fast we can get it.
DILLINGER: Egyptian cotton. Since we been out I go for the finest stuff. As much as I can get, as fast we can get it.
BILLIE: ( SUITCASES ) Where you goin'?
DILLINGER: Nowhere. What do you mean?
BILLIE: You're all packed.
DILLINGER: Always are. Ready to get up and go in a She stands next to him in the bed now. He pulls her down next to him.. She turns her good ear towards him.
BILLIE: I was married once. He was too handy with his fists. She stares at Dillinger. Will this put him off.
DILLINGER: Where's he now?
BILLIE: In prison. I divorced him. Only mistake I made was marrying him in the first place. He got caught mugging a mailman.
DILLINGER: A criminal mastermind.
BILLIE: After my daddy died, we went to live on the reservation in Flandreau. In Flandreau nothin' ever happened.
DILLINGER: Well baby-you're going to start a new and exciting kind of life from right now. And as they're pulled to each other and start making love again, she stops.
BILLIE: heat do you want?
DILLINGER: To please you. That's not what she meant, but gently, he rolls her over on the bed. A smile spreads slowly across her lips.
BAUM: Rorer tailed it. Berman dropped it in an alley next to the Sherone Apartments 20 minutes ago. Rorer talked to a neighbor. Men go in and out at night carrying heavy suitcases. One looks like Dillinger.
PURVIS: Let's go. Right now. They race out.
PURVI S: Where are your men?
COWLEY: My car's on Sheridan and Montrose and Rice in the Ford is on Sheridan and Blocking vehicles? End of this street? They aren't "deployed." They're merely "here". Cowley gets it. Purvis exchanges a look with Baum, checks his gun.

LEONARD: Something wrong?
PURVIS: You have identification?
LEONARD: Honey, would you get my driver's licence. It's in my coat pocket. Leonard sums reluctant to get up. With his right hand, he takes a forkful of food. His left is under the table. Now, we see that he:.'s holding.
PURVIS: What do you do for a living, Leonard?
LEONARD: I travel in ladies shoes. He smiles at his joke. Vi enters with his wallet. Barton sees the driver's license.
PURVIS: Do you carry around samples?
LEONARD: Sure. Big suitcases.
PURVIS: ( handing back the licence ) Enjoy the rest of your dinner, Mr. INT. CARPETED HALLWAY ON THIRD FLOOR - PURVIS + BARTON walk the length of the hall. Vi closed the door behind them.

PURVIS: ( LOW ) Its all wrong. No one in or out. I'll get the others. ( at door to stairs next to the elevator door ) Stay here, watch that door from right Purvis leaves. Barton wants to do it right. Then, he hears movement from Apt. 302. Objects being hurriedly shifted. He starts back down the hallway. Halfway between it and the Behind him, the elevator doors open. Barton turns hi.,,back on Apt. 302. He's caught between 302 and the elevator.-".-

BARTON: Bureau of Investigation. What's your ( flashes badge )
CARROLL: You wanna know my name? Barton sees Carroll's eyes flicker, slight smile. He spins.
PURVIS: Pull the men from Sheridan and Wilson.
PURVIS: -reacting- grabs the Thompson from Madala and runs back inside.
BARTON: in the final moments of his life. Barton looks up into Purvis` eyes: Help me! Purvis does not know what to do. Then Barton's eyes drift Purvis impels himself to action. He kicks in the door to Apt.
PURVIS: Where is he?!
PURVIS: They headed north! The Sheridan Road car?
RICE: That's us. We heard gunfire. So we. ( gets it ) .came here. They're fucked.
MADALA: Was it Dillinger?
BAUM: No. It was Lester Gillis. Purvis sinks.
PURVIS: The man we let get away wasn't John ( BEAT ) It was Baby Face Nelson.
TELLER: Change a. twenty?
PIERPONT: Change a. twenty?
DILLINGER: vaults the five foot divider railing and trains two 45s on the TELLERS.
DILLINGER: Get over to the vault! Everybody! Go on!
HOMER: on Lookout watches the street. Nothing. Dillinger and Pierpont carrying canvas bags cross through the foreground INT. STUDEBAKER RED throws it into gear and they drive away. Homer jumps on the running board. Dillinger looks over his shoulder. Awestruck pedestrian. From the other end of Main Street, no pursuit.
HOOVER: ( into phone ) That was a miserable piece of work.
PURVIS: ( into phone ) Yes, it was. I take full responsibility, Hoover calms for a moment.
HOOVER: I thought you understood what I am doing.build.ing a department of professional investigators. Young college men with law or accounting degrees from good families. No, you may not go outside the Bureau, Purvis.
PURVIS: The Bureau has used these men before.
HOOVER: They are not our "type."
PURVIS: Our "type" cannot get the job done.
HOOVER: ( dead cold ) Mr. Tolson will call you, Agent Purvis.
PURVIS: Thank you.
WINSTEAD: What'd he say he looked like?
HURT: Didn't say. Their suitcases have been set on the platform. A PORTER Gentlemen need a hand?
PORTER: Gentlemen need a hand?
WINSTEAD: That's right. His terse reply makes the garrulous porter stop talking.
CAMPBELL: I'll call.
HURT: I'm going to the men's room. Winstead spots a shoe-shine stand. Winstead sits, nods and the SHOE SHINE MAN begins to polish his Western boots. He's startled bi:the knife in a sheath built into the right boot.
WINSTEAD: Wcrk around it. From under the brim of his hat, Winstead glances at big city life in Union Station. He's an ominous presence. HEAR the excited roar of a CROWD and we

NITTI: How's he doing on the wire service?
PHIL D'ANDREA: Feeding to 300 bookies now. And he came up with this gimmick called a scratch Another beat. Nitti stops for a beat
NITTI: Its hot out, right?
PHIL D'ANDREA: Yeah, Frank.
NITTI: Ever since those pricks shot me I can't get warm. ( notices Phil's attention ) PHIL D' ANDREA Some friends from Chicago in the D'Andrea nods. John Dillinger nods back. Nitti glances at them; glances away. Dillinger has on sunglasses. Billie is wearing a straw hat. They are shouting to the greyhounds along with Pierpont, Homer and Makley and some girls. They have tall drinks. This is the good life for the privileged few in the middle of the A dog wins; not theirs. It calms down.
DILLINGER: ( to Pierpont; business ) Well drive out separately.
PIERPONT: I want to take 66 and check banks in Denver and Phoenix. We'll meet you in Tucson on the 25th.
VAN METER: I think we wore out the Midwest for ( BEAT ) I heard one today. Indiana paper.

DILLINGER: She is quiet for a moment.
BILLIE: Thank you, thank you for these last few weeks. I never thought I'd see Florida.
DILLINGER: You going somewhere, doll, am I?
BILLIE: It's been, three, four weeks. You'll look for a change. Or you'll get tired of me. And then I'll be sad and angry. So I wanted to say thank you before then. Dillinger is surprised that her expectations are so low. She didn't think his interest in her to be more than passing.
DILLINGER: You want to leave?
BILLIE: No. But I'm no fool. I'll be back checking coats at the Steuben Club.
DILLINGER: Well, I don't want you to leave. So it won't be that way.
BILLIE: Then it will be another way that's worse.
DILLINGER: Who the hell gave you a crystal ball?!
WILLIE: Well, goddamn it, you don't need a crystal ball.! Ask Homer.
DILLINGER: Homer what.?
BILLIE: Homer and his damn joke. I don't want to be around to see any of that. Okay?! That's what it's about. Dillinger gets it.
DILLINGER: I am not going anywhere! I am going to die in your arms as an old man when that time comes. So what do you say about CLOSE ON BILLIE Now is the first time she allows herself to have any prospect about a future with him. It's a shock.
CLERK: Mr. and Mrs. Frank Sullivan of Green Bay, Wd cons in. How was your journey, sir?
DILLINGER: ., â¢ ng.
CLERK: I can send up some sandwiches and beer, if you'd like.
DILLINGER: That would be swell. Some friends of mine should be here already. J.C. Davies and Mr. Long?
CLERK: Out shopping, I believe. I'll let them know you're in when they come back. Old BELLHOP takes Billie's bag to the elevator. Dillinger carries his own case.
DILLINGER: You want company?
DILLINGER: First time you ever put me off. You getting tired of me?
BILLIE: ( his answer ) Get in here. She stretches out and wets her hair. She sits up to reach for the shampoo. Dillinger's got it and rubs it into her hair. Dillinger hears something in the street. He goes to the window and sees a car parked irregularly. TWO MEN get out.
DILLINGER: Get dressed. Right now. He turns and runs into.
CRASH!: THREE MEN burst in. One is the Clerk. He cracks Dillinger across the head with the stock of his shotgun. Dillinger falls to his knees. Clerk hits him twice more. Billie rushes into the room.. She's naked. The two men from the street haul Dillinger, bloody and semi-conscious, to his feet and throw him against the wall and cuff him.
DILLINGER: What happened?
PIERPONT: Fire in the hotel. Firemen found our guns. Laid for us! Sorry, John.
DILLINGER: ( shouts after them ) Where they taking you?
PIERPONT: ( shouts back ) We're getting Shanghaied to Ohio!
DILLINGER: Where's Billie.? Thenthey're gone. They now move Dillinger through.
COP EYMAN: Your girl's been put on a bus back to Chicago. We ain't holding her.
MELVIN PURVIS: is there. Cowley and Baum are with him. Purvis is brought to the cell. The COP who brought him goes back to his card game with four or five Tucson Deputies. We SEE Winstead and Hurt in their suits and ties are there, too. They lounge at ease. A Tucson Deputy gives them coffee. Eye contact with But Dillinger reacts to Purvis.
DILLINGER: ( BEAT ) Well, the man who killed Pretty Boy Floyd. He might have been "Pretty," 'cause he sure was not "Whiz Kid Floyd." Deputies stifle laughter. Dillinger comes up close to Purvis. They are eyeball to eyeball. Only the bars separate them.
PURVIS: What keeps you up, nights, Mr. Dillinger? Now Dillinger reads him like an X-ray.
DILLINGER: ( doesn't answer ) You act like a confident man, Purvis. Bu _, I don't see it. You know a few things. You're probably okay when there's a groupÂ° of you got the other guy outnumbered. But death and mayhem up close? I am used to that and you are not, are you? When it's toe to toe, "One of us will die right here, right now," I don't think you got the get up and go. Purvis has nothing to say. He stares at Dillinger. Then he turns to leave.
PURVIS: Goodbye, Mr. Dillinger.
DILLINGER: I'll see you down the road. From ten feet away.
PURVIS: ( QUIETLY ) No you wont. The only way you'll leave a jail cell is when we take you out to execute you.
DILLINGER: Oh, yeah? We will see about that.
COP EYMAN: We'd like that, Johnny, but don't get too comfortable. They're moving you.
DILLINGER: `Where to?
COP EYMAN: why? I have absolutely nothing I want to do in Indiana.
DILLINGER: why? I have absolutely nothing I want to do in Indiana.
DEPUTY: He's here. A diminutive woman, SHERIFF HOLLEY goes to greet the massive cops who bring John Dillinger into her reception area and its crowd of 30 reporters.
SHERIFF HOLLEY: ( to reporters ) Back up over there. Dellinger looks at the crowd. Per the "Chicago Daily News "His diction was amazing - better in many instances than that of his interviewers his poise no less so. There Was no hint of hardness about him, no evidence save in the alert presence of armed policemen that he had spent his formative years in a penitentiary. He had none of the sneer of-the criminal. Looking at him for the first time.,.heIates as the most amazing specimen of his kind ever seen outside of wildly imaginative moving picture."
REPORTER: Johnny, are you glad to see Indiana Dillinger's slow charismatic smile.
DILLINGER: About as glad as Indiana is to see me. Everybody laughs.
REPORTER #2: Did you smuggle the guns into Indiana State Penitentiary for the big break of September 26th?
REPORTER: How'd you get them in?
DILLINGER: ( SMILES ) Right there, you're too inquistive.
PHOTOGRAPHER: Hey Bob. ( to Prosecutor Robert Estill ) Put your arm around Dellinger. FLASHBULBS POP. They fluster Estill. Dillinger props his elbow on the prosecutor's shoulder and cracks a broad grin. The Prosecutor complies. They look like old pals.

I stick to my friends and they stick to me.
DILLINGER'S EYES: SEE him work the reporters. He knows that they are sympathetic. He plays them like a champ. The New York Times called this moment. "a modern version of the return of the prodigal son."
ANOTHER REPORTER: How long does it take you to go through a One minute and 40 seconds flat. Dillinger nods and turns away. He - not the Sheriff - ends the press conference.
DILLINGER: One minute and 40 seconds flat. Dillinger nods and turns away. He - not the Sheriff - ends the press conference.
DAY: LOUIS PIQUETT - a former bartender and Chicago gangland's melodramatic mouthpiece - is escorted to the cellblock by jailor LEWIS BAKER.
DILLINGER: You come highly recommended by Alvin Karpis. What can you do for me?
PIQUETT: What's on your mind?
DILLINGER: The electric chair. There's none of Dil linger's cocky joie de vivre. Thaw-'s for INT. LAKE COUNTY COURT - JUDGE MURRAY - DAY is on the bench. Dillinger is shackled to his chair. The courtroom is packed. Walls are lined with deputies holding rifles. Reporters scribble. The gavel quiets the ( on his feet ) Your honor! Are we to have a hearing in accord with the laws of this nation, or is the State to be permitted to incite an atmosphere of prejudice? The very air reeks with the bloody rancor of intolerant malice. The clanging of shackles brings to our minds the dungeons of the Czars, not the flag-bedecked liberty of an American courtroom. I request the court to direct that those shackles be removed forthwith!
PIQUETT: ( on his feet ) Your honor! Are we to have a hearing in accord with the laws of this nation, or is the State to be permitted to incite an atmosphere of prejudice? The very air reeks with the bloody rancor of intolerant malice. The clanging of shackles brings to our minds the dungeons of the Czars, not the flag-bedecked liberty of an American courtroom. I request the court to direct that those shackles be removed forthwith!
ROBERT ESTILL: This is a very dangerous man, your Honor.
DEPUTY HOLLEY: ( Lillian Holley's nephew ) And I'm responsible for the safeguarding of the prisoner.
P IQUETT: Who are you?! Are you a lawyer? What right have you to address this court?
JUDGE MURRAY: Alright, remove the handcuffs from the ROBERT ESTILL Your honor, we'd like to relocate the prisoner. Only Indiana State Prison in Michigan city can guarantee Dillinger will not escape.
ROBERT ESTILL: Your honor, we'd like to relocate the prisoner. Only Indiana State Prison in Michigan city can guarantee Dillinger will not escape.
JUDGE MURRAY: Sheriff Holley?
SHERIFF HOLLEY: I concur, your honor.
PIQUETT: Sheriff Holley, I think it's a very nice jail you have right here. What makes you think there's anything wrong with it?
SHERIFF HOLLEY: There isn't anything wrong with my jail! It's the strongest jail in Indiana.
PIQUETT: That's what I thought. But of course, I don't want to embarrass Mrs. Holley. I appreciate that she's a woman and if she's afraid of an escape.
SHERIFF HOLLEY: I'm not afraid of an escape. I can take care of John Dillinger or any other JUDGE MURRAY Okay, Dillinger will stay here. Dillinger's staying in crown Point. Dillinger's relieved.
JUDGE MURRAY: Okay, Dillinger will stay here. Dillinger's staying in crown Point. Dillinger's relieved.
PIQUETT: Thank you, your Honor. The Defense will need four months to prepare itself.
ROBERT ESTILL: It should take 10 days.
PIQUETT: To go on trial in 10 days would be a legal lynching of this lad! There's a law against lynching!
ROBERT ESTILL: There's a law against murder!
PIQUETT: Then observe the law part. Or just stand Dillinger against the wall and shoot him. Then, there's no need to throw away the State's money on this mockery.
JUDGE MURRAY: ( to both lawyers ) Calm down.
PIQUETT: I apologize to the court. ( indicating Estill ) Bob and I respect each other very much.
JUDGE MURRAY: ( warns Estill ) Watch out or he'll be putting his arm around you, too. Laughter ripples.
DILLINGER: Atta boy, counsel.
CORRIDOR: It runs the length of the jail. At the far end is the barred door to the criminal cell block.
CAHOON: GUARD BRYANT pulls a lever, opening the cells in the cell Dillinger and 14 PRISONERS step out of their cells, free to roam the corridor behind the barred cell-block door. Cahoon and TWO TRUSTEES, carrying boxes of toilet paper, soap and Dutch cleanser, enter. Dillinger jabs something in Cahoon's belly. Cahoon gets a glimpse: it's a small black gun.
DILLINGER: -Cpme on, Sam, we're going places. A hulking black prisoner, HERBERT YOUNGBLOOD, holding a length of ipe, materializes next to Dellinger and ushers Bryant and the Trustees into an empty cell. Youngblood pulls the lever, locking the cells.
DILLINGER: Call the warden.
CAHOON: Warden! Warden? Come on back! Warden LEW BAKER emerges from the office. Dillinger raises the gun.
WARDEN BAKER: That ain't real.
DILLINGER: Anything you say.
DILLINGER: No one move or I'll plug the warden. Dillinger grabs two Tommy guns. Youngblood starts tying up their prisoners. Baker stares at Dillinger's pistol.
WARDEN BAKER: I was right, wasn't I? It's not real.
DILLINGER: Alright, which of these here cars is the fastest, and you're going with, so don't. That would be the Ford in the corner. It's got the new V-8.
SAAGER: That would be the Ford in the corner. It's got the new V-8.
DILLINGER: We're taking that.
SAAGER: ( HESITATING ) That's Sheriff Lillian Holley's personal That even more highly recommends it. Dillinger starts ripping ignition wires out of the other cars. Dillinger, Youngblood, Deputy Sheriff Blunk, and Saager are herded into the Sheriff's Ford V-8.
YOUNGBLOOD: We got a car following.
DILLINGER: ( re acceleration ) Wow. Mr. Youngblood, are we clear now?
YOUNGBLOOD: We are.
DILLINGER: okay, folks. Dillinger checks his rearview mirror, then the speedometer. He's impressed.
REPORTER: How did he act?
REPORTER: What did he sing?
NARRATOR: ( Lowell Thomas voice ) As John Dillinger escaped from the Crown Point jail .or as folks now call it, the "Clown Point Jail".he appears immune to the forces of law. And commenting in his fireside address on March 5th, 1933.
FDR: The Federal government, you know, cannot be held up to mockery in this way. Hoover is rocked. It's as if FDR is saying Hoover is the man responsible for the federal government being mocked.
NARRATOR: ( pause; heraldic music ) Meanwhile, the Emperor Haile Selassie.
DILLINGER: watches cars, people, then.
DILLINGER: ( into the phone ) It's me, Baby.

DILLINGER: love you, Baby. Dillinger ends the call. Hamilton waits in a Hudson at the INT. TELEPHONE EXCHANGE Madala shakes his head - no trace.
PURVIS: She knows we're watching and he knows we're listening.
DILLINGER: ( big smile ) Hiya Sport.
SPORT: How're ya doin' Mr. Johnny? You gotta hold it right there. Where's the warm welcome.?
DILLINGER: Where's Carole?
SPORT: They got moved to Newport, Kentucky.
DILLINGER: Says who?
ZARKOVICH: ( moves into doorway ) Sport's only following orders. So am I. He demonstrates that his palms are empty. He's smart enough not to be armed.
DILLINGER: I don't get it.
ZARKOVICH: You go talk to your pal, Gilbert.
DILLINGER: About what?
ZARKOVICH: Talk to Gilbert Catena. Dillinger, not taking his eyes off windows and doors, backs away. He knows there are more men. Zarkovich is nervous and frozen because.
RED HAMILTON'S: front sight rests on Zarkovich's heart which he would blow out the back of his chest with the souped-up 351 Winchester. Now, Dillinger pulls the '34 Ford out of the backyard with Red still on the running board. Zarkovich almost faints in CUT TO: EXT. BRICK STREET IN KANKAKEE, ILLINOIS - THE '34 FORD - DAY pulls to the curb. Weeds. Vestiges of prairie. An old house sits at the back of a lot. A workshop is near the road. A sign says 'ï¿½Lieboldt Repair."
DILLINGER: We're looking for Oscar.is he home?
MRS. LIEBOLDT: I'm Mrs. Lieboldt. And he ain't home. He's dead. Johnny glances at Red.
DILLINGER: I sure am sorry, ma'am. Was it an. MRS. LIEBOLDT He accidentally got in the way of a shotgun when it was going off. What do you want?
MRS. LIEBOLDT: He accidentally got in the way of a shotgun when it was going off. What do you want?
DILLINGER: Oscar had "tools" of mine, he was repairing them.
MRS. LIEBOLDT: Everything that was here? Those people took it all away. It ain't here no more.
DILLINGER: I went to East Chicago to lay low. The welcome mat was not out. And I kept hearing your name.
GILBERT: Let me make a telephone call. Dillinger nods.
D'ANDREA: ( irritated; to Catena ) Anybody see him come in?
GILBERT: I don't think so. SOLDIER ONE. Dillinger turns the man, slams a knee into his under his jaw, as he draws the second 45 and sweeps the Wanna know if we're armed? Were armed.

D'ANDREA: k around, Johnny. What do you see?
D'ANDREA: You see money. Before last month there were independent wire services letting bookies know who won the third race at Sportman's Park. 300 of 'em. Now there's only one. Ours. General News. Nationwide. On October20, you robbed the bank in Green Castle, Indiana. You got away with $74,802. Split 5 ways, that's $14,960.40. You probably thought that was a big Dillinger stares at him. Where's this going?
DILLINGER: But they won't.
D'ANDREA: That's right. We pay them not to. Unless they know you're here. Then they come through the door, no matter what.
DILLINGER: I'm popular.
D'ANDREA: You're bad for business. What this is, is called obsolescence.
HAMILTON: Why'd you sign that asshole's paper?
DILLINGER: I don't know.
HOOVER: .they call Crown Point, "Clown Point." ,,.,The Bureau of Investigation cannot catch ""Public Enemy No. 1, but Arizona cowboys zï¿½. The President of the United States -s'aid Dillinger is making a mockery of the system of justice in this country. That means I am allowing Dillinger to make a mockery of the system of justice in this country. It is a dark cloud. There is a silver lining in that cloud. By escaping, John Dillinger has given us a second chance to get John Dillinger.
PURVIS: Hamilton's family hasn't had word from him in years .
HOOVER: That's the point. Motivate them to get "word." Create informants, Agent Purvis.
HOOVER: What's your name, son?
HARRIS: The cameras roll.
HOOVER: ( turning to camera ) G-Men all over the country have picked up: the gauntlet flung down by the outlaws and wanton murderers. And these junior crime fighters, these junior G-men. COLOR DESATURATES into BLACK + WHITE. We don't kno Â°why.
TOMMY CARROLL: ( WHISPERS ) You got Lester wrong. He thinks the world of you. Whole country thinks you're a by Harry P e rpont's mug shot. Now, SHOUSE,enters and sits next to Tommy. We haven't seen him since Johnny threw him out of the car in Indiana. He holds out his hand.

CARROLL: John, we gotta all be friends or this ain't gonna work.
DILLINGER: Red told you. After we take the bank, we bust out Pierpont and Makley.
SHOUSE: They got the prison surrounded by National Guard.
HAMILTON: Oh Jesus. Now the LIGHTS come up!
JOHN DILLINGER: The exposure is so outrageous it makes Dillinger laugh out loud. That makes the people all around talk and joke.
DILLINGER'S HAND: grips his45. Shouse is grey with fear. Houselights darken. Finally, Looney Tunes starts. Daffy Duck.
CARROLL: ( LOW ) After the bank we'll figure out if we can bust out Pierpont and Makley.
HAMILTON: Shouse, you step out of line one inch and and I will kill you. Then I will kill your parents for having had you. Then I will kill their pet dog.
DILLINGER: Where's the bank?
CARROLL: Sioux Falls. Nelson says there's $800,000 in there. He got us a great place to hole- up after 'til the heat blows over.
HAMILTON: "Don't work with people you don't know and don't work when you're desperate." Walter Dietrich. Remember that?
DILLINGER: Walter forgot .when you're desperate, 'f iat's when you got no choice.
DILLINGER: ( passing Nelson ) You're turning it into a circus! What the hell are you doing? Meanwhile, a terrified CLERK presses a button and the alarm rings loudly outside.
VAULT: Its a lot less than $800,000.
DILLINGER: Where in the hell's all the big money?
LOBBY: Through the window Carroll sees a motorcycle cop, HALE KEITH, arrive outside. Nelson scrambles onto a desk and FIRES a burst through the plate glass.
NELSON: What are you looking at? Nelson FIRES over their heads. Hostages scream and try to break loose. Nelson advances on the crowd. Out of a JEWELRY STORE, HARRY BERG, emerges and fires at BABY FACE NELSON, who is wearing a bullet-proof vest. Nelson sprays the area. Berg dives back in his store, BYSTANDER, JACOB SOLOMON, is hit in the stomach and crumples. Delay EXT. ROOFTOPS ACROSS THE STREET DEPUTY with a 44-40Winchester gets a bead on
DILLINGER: ( CONTINUED ) He squeezes off a ROUND. The shot hits Dillinger in the back of the left shoulder and exits his upper arm.
DILLINGER: Son of a bitch!
BANG!: The second shot hits Carroll in the head, knocking off his hat. Dillinger fires up at the DEPUTY, tries to lift Carroll, blood gushes from his head. He appears to be dead. Dillinger leaves him. Sixteen year old, JOE PAWLOWSKI fueled by adrenaline, runs across the street and jumps onto Nelson's back. Nelson, screaming with rage, throws him through a plate glass window, FIRES two rounds and runs to join the others PURE CHAOS. Dillinger throws Nelson in the car.
THE HUDSON: surges forward. The car proceeds to an intersection and Shouse cant find his place on the.git.
HAMILTON: Right! Goddamnit! Right! As Shouse makes the turn.
DILLINGER: How'd you find this place? Dillinger looks at Wanetka. He's uneasy. He trusts nothing about it.
NELSON: Couple of Chicago guys told Tommy. Don't worry, nobody's gonna find us. He thinks were salesmen.
DILLINGER: How much? Nobody wants to answer. Hamilton meanwhile uses Atropine sulphate to clean Dillinger's wound.
DILLINGER: That would be less than $800,000, right? VAN METER Still more than $8,000 a man.
VAN METER: Still more than $8,000 a man.
DILLINGER: Leave my money and get out. Van Meter, Nelson and Shouse exit.
HAMILTON: You need to rest up awhile.
DILLINGER: No. We don't get out of here in the morning, we're going to wind up dead.
HAMILTON: We could head to Reno. Dillinger lies back in bed, looks around the room, angry and frustrated. Hamilton gets up to leave.
DILLINGER: I need two more guns, Red. OVER we HEAR the SOUND OF SOMEONE SCREAMING and CALLING OUT
CARROLL: Gimme the shot, Doc. Please. I'm begging Not until you tell us! As the pressure inside his skull becomes unbearable

REINECKE: If you tell us all about him, maybe you'll get a break. Maybe you end up doing a couple of months on a work farm., like a girls' home or something.
