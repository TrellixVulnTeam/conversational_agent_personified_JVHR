MOON: Written by Nathan Parker Duncan Jones
SAM: Tess. Hi. It's me. How are you, sweetheart? It's the morning here. In a few minutes Gerty and I will sit down for breakfast, go over the day's itinerary.
PHOTOGRAPH: Of a slightly younger and clean-shaven Sam with his arms wrapped around his wife of four years, TESS BELL.
SAM: Please kiss Eve for me. And tell her daddy will only be away a little longer seventeen days longer, approximately. I love you both dearly. Bye.
SAM: Morning, Gerty.
GERTY: Morning, Sam. How are you today?
SAM: Fine. Fine. You?
GERTY: I'm very well. How's your
SAM: Much better, thanks, pal.
SAM: 8:32 Pacific Time. Lunar Day 1. All Harvesters running smoothly this morning. Readouts are as follows: Matthew, 14.6 miles; Mark 16.8 miles.
BOARD: Sam stands before the Big Board. The names of the four Harvesters ( Matthew, Mark, Luke, John ) in a collum. The red light is flashing next to Matthew. Sam presses an INTERCOM BUTTON, dips down, speaks into it.
SAM: Gerty, we've got a live one on Mark. I'm going out now to rope her in.
GERTY'S VOICE: Okay, Sam.
SAM: Sam Bell reporting to Central. 10:14 Pacific Time. Lunar Day 1. Overmeyers, Thompson? It's Sam. How goes it? I've got a full container of Helium3 ready to roll. The purity is pretty good, so assuming your last market prices are still relevant I think you are looking at getting about 3 million dollars per kilo with this load. By the time this message reaches you it should be in transit. Otherwise, everything running smoothly. There was a discrepancy between a couple of the N3000 modulators a couple of days ago, but Gerty and I caught it in time, no big deal. Uh.how are things down there?
GERTY: Sam, is everything okay?
SAM: Everything's fine, Gerty.
GERTY: You don't seem like yourself
SAM: It's Tess.
GERTY: Has something happened?
SAM: No, not exactly.
GERTY: Sam, what is it?
SAM: Something doesn't feel right, that's all.
GERTY: Sam, it might help to talk about
SAM: Tess isn't responding to things.
GERTY: Tess isn't responding to things?
SAM: What kind of things?
GERTY: What kind of things?
SAM: ( a beat ) A couple of weeks ago I asked her if she wanted to go on vacation when I get back, and that I was thinking of either Mexico or Tess never said anything about it. Three messages she's sent me since.and she's never once mentioned the vacation.
GERTY: Im sure she can't wait, Sam.
SAM: That's not the point. This is someone who lives for vacations and travelling. I thought she'd jump at the chance for us to go away with Eve, of course we'd take Eve.
GERTY: Perhaps Tess didn't receive the But this isn't the only time it's happened, Gerty. When I asked her how her dad was doing on his new heart medicine she didn't respond to that I asked her when Eve was going to start nursery nothing. Had her brother got the position at the University? Nothing. Nothing.
SAM: ( as if anticipating But this isn't the only time it's happened, Gerty. When I asked her how her dad was doing on his new heart medicine she didn't respond to that I asked her when Eve was going to start nursery nothing. Had her brother got the position at the University? Nothing. Nothing.
GERTY: I think her brother did get the position at the University. His name is Christopher, correct?
SAM: He did?
GERTY: Yes, I seem to recall he got the position. Professor of Biochemistry, I think. At Syracuse University in New York? How do you know that?
SAM: How do you know that?
GERTY: You told me. Some time ago now. Towards the beginning of your time on Selene. When we were starting to get to know each You were very happy for your brother-in-law. You danced around the Rec Room, if I remember
SAM: Gerty, have you heard anything new about anyone fixing lunar No Sam. From what I understand it's fairly low on the companies priority list with the Jupiter mission active. I would imagine it would be very expensive to
GERTY: No Sam. From what I understand it's fairly low on the companies priority list with the Jupiter mission active. I would imagine it would be very expensive to
SAM: They need to sort that out. Seriously. I've only got two weeks left. It's not fair on whoever's up here next. Gerty, you tell them to sort it out. It's not healthy.
GERTY: I will Sam. Do you want me to finish cutting your hair later?
SAM: Nah. Come on. Let's finish
GERTY: Of course. Now?
SAM: No not now, afterwards.
ON SAM: He carefully puts down the wooden figure and the exacto blade stands and leaves the Rec Room.
OVERMEYERS: Delighted to hear about the latest shipment, Sam.
THOMPSON: According to Albatross 90 it should be landing off the California Coast within the next three days.
OVERMEYERS: Now in response to your question about the communications equipment, the news is not good.
THOMPSON: Sam, those solar storms did a lot more damage than initially Fixing the lunar sat is going to take some time. It's a significant operation.
OVERMEYERS: Fixing the lunar sat is going to take some time. It's a significant operation.
THOMPSON: And what with the Jupiter Program hemorrhaging money
OVERMEYERS: Lunar doesn't have the budget it once did, Sam, you know that.
THOMPSON: Even the coffee machine down in the Hub has been broken since I don't know when
OVERMEYERS: We have to go to Genesis 3 just to get a decent cup of coffee, Sam. Genesis 3. That's three buildings over.
THOMPSON: We're hoping to get the live feed up and running by the Fall. The good news is you'll be home by then, Sam.
OVERMEYERS: You only have two weeks to go!
GERTY'S VOICE: Sam, a transmission has arrived from your wife.
SAM: Be right there.
TESS: Hi Sam. It's me. How are you? I got your last message, it was really great to hear your voice. I know you've been really lonely up there, but in a lot of ways it's been good for you, I think. I hope you don't mind me saying that. I'm proud of you. Hey, someone's got something to
EVE: Who's an astronaut? Go on!
TESS: Who's an astronaut? Go on!
EVE: Daddy asstraut!
TESS: That's right, daddy's an astronaut. Clever girl!
SAM: What's on the menu tonight, Baby back ribs with french fries and spinach.
GERTY: Baby back ribs with french fries and spinach.
SAM: Ribs! Good choice, pal. Fine
SAM: And then we CUT to Sam standing in the kitchen. Over by the model there is no sign of the Girl. The chair is empty. She's gone. Her sitting there, Sam's walk across the room apparently he imagined it all. Sam looks down. The tea kettle is dangling at an angle and BOILING WATER is DRIBBLING onto his left hand. Simultaneously: Sam SNAPS his hand AWAY, Sam SCREAMS. The tea kettle CLATTERS to the floor. Sam HURRIES to the sink and jerks his hand under a stream of cold water. Cursing under his breath the whole time: "Shit, piss, fuck."
SAM: I'm going to feel that for a while, aren't I, Gerty? Damn it.
GERTY: Sam, can I ask how it happened?
SAM: I told you, I saw something on the TV and spilled boiling water on my hand.
GERTY: You saw something on the TV?
SAM: ( a touch petulant ) Yeah, something on the TV distracted me, Gerty, what's wrong with that?
GERTY: Sam, you said it was the TV that distracted you, but when I came in the TV wasn't on.
SAM: Morning, Gerty.
GERTY: Morning, Sam. How are you today?
SAM: Fine. Fine.
GERTY: How's the hand?
SAM: It's a little sore.
SAM: 8:19 Pacific Time. Lunar Day 2. Readouts are as follows: Matthew, 9.8 Miles.
"ERROR.": The word flashes three times before the screen returns to normal, the CLOCK running again.
SAM: Gerty, looks like we've got a live one out on Matthew. I wondered what was taking him so long, the old fart. I'm heading out in a few minutes, just going to finish my coffee.
GERTY'S VOICE: Okay, Sam.
SAM: His face unfolding with panic, alarm, curiosity. An intense, yearning, curiosity.
SAM: Where am I?
GERTY: Sam, you're in the Infirmary. You had an accident.
SAM: ( a beat ) I don't remember a thing. Do you remember me?
GERTY: Do you remember me?
SAM: Yes, of course I remember you, That's good. That's very good. It's nice to see you awake again. I'd like to keep you under observation here in the Infirmary for a few days and run some
GERTY: That's good. That's very good. It's nice to see you awake again. I'd like to keep you under observation here in the Infirmary for a few days and run some
SAM: How long have I been out?
GERTY: Not long. Sam, go back to sleep. You're still very tired. We can talk later.
SAM: No sign of the robot. Sam is feeling well enough to walk. He swings his legs out of bed, begins to plod around the room. He is tentative at first, slow, as if walking is something he is having to learn from scratch. Eventually when he is moving fluidly he goes to the door and pokes his head out into the corridor.
SAM: The voices continue. Intrigued, Sam PRESSES ON down the ON SAM As he walks up the corridor in the direction of the Comms Room. Sam is close enough now that he can actually hear the Sam arrives at the door of the Comms Room and peers in.
ON SAM: As he walks up the corridor in the direction of the Comms Room. Sam is close enough now that he can actually hear the Sam arrives at the door of the Comms Room and peers in.
GERTY: Sam, you're out of bed.
SAM: I wanted to stretch my legs. What was that?
GERTY: Not talking. No. We've been having some problems with the lunar sat and our live feed seems to be down. I was recording a video message for Central updating them on your progress. Sam, you need to stay in bed. You're not ready to walk around
GERTY: Excellent, Sam.
SAM: How much longer do I have to be in here, Gerty?
GERTY: Sam, you suffered minor brain damage in the crash. This has resulted in memory loss and slight logic impairment.
SAM: When can I get back to work?
GERTY: Central has asked me to slow down the Harvesters to ensure you have time to recuperate and get your strength back
SAM: ( dryly, exasperated ) The good news is you can return to the sleeping quarters tomorrow. But it will still be a few more days before you can resume anything like a normal work schedule.
GERTY: The good news is you can return to the sleeping quarters tomorrow. But it will still be a few more days before you can resume anything like a normal work schedule.
SAM: Gerty, do you know about this?
SAM: There's no way to tell from here if a track's been thrown, or if it's just something jammed in an axle, or what. I can shoot out there, check it out, get some video and maybe save you guys the expense of floating in a whole crew! I know how tight money is right now.. Just give me the word or Gerty the word, tell him to unlock the exit doors and I'll go out and get Matthew up and running again. That's it. Over and out.
THOMPSON: Sam, we appreciate the offer, but you concentrate on feeling Oh for Christ's sake.
SAM: ( muttering, vexed ) Oh for Christ's sake.
OVERMEYERS: We don't want you to take any unnecessary risks. You're too important to us.
THOMPSON: You're to stay put, understand?
OVERMEYERS: It's an order.
THOMPSON: It's an order, Sam. From Lunar. Stay put.
OVERMEYERS: We're going to send a Rescue Unit to tend to the stalled harvester and get the base back on its
SAM: ( incensed )
GERTY: I'm sorry Sam.
TESS: He's kicking.or she's kicking. I'm certain he's a boy. I wish you could feel it. I think we made the right choice, Sam. I really do. We need some time apart. We got stuck. That happens in marriages sometimes. It's nothing terrible. Well listen, I love you lots and we'll talk soon, okay? Bye
SAM: Fuck it.
SAM: Gerty! Get over here! Quickly!
GERTY: What happened?
SAM: Don't know Micro meteorites, maybe? Either way there might be damage to the exterior shell. I'd better go outside and take a There is no damage to the exterior shell.
GERTY: There is no damage to the exterior shell.
SAM: It's not that I don't believe you, Gerty, but the inner skin is springing leaks like an ACME fire hose. Maybe you better let me take a look, just in case, huh?
GERTY: Sam, I'm not supposed to let you go outside.
SAM: Then let's keep it between you and me then. Ok?
GERTY: Okay, Sam.
SAM: Gerty! Gerty! Help!
SAM: Gerty approaches, gliding along his rail. Sam is freaking out big time, exhausted, panic-stricken, bewildered.
GERTY: We need to get him to the Not until you tell me who he is!
SAM: Not until you tell me who he is!
GERTY: Sam, we need to get him to the Infirmary immediately. Who is he! Who is he!
SAM: Who is he! Who is he!
GERTY: Hello Sam. How are you feeling?
SAM 1: Where am I?
GERTY: The Infirmary. You had an accident out by one of the harvesters. Do you remember? I saw someone out there, Gerty.
SAM 1: I saw someone out there, Gerty.
GERTY: Who did you see, Sam?
SAM 1: I saw a girl.
GERTY: You saw a girl out by the harvester? How is that possible? Sam, you suffered a slight concussion in the crash and have incurred minor injuries, but all in all the prognosis is good. I'm happy to see you again.
SAM 1: Yes, Sam?
GERTY: Yes, Sam?
SAM 1: Is there someone in the room with Who is he?
GERTY: SAM 1
SAM 1: Who is he?
GERTY: Sam, get some sleep. You're very
SAM 1: Sam 2 just nods. He turns back to the TV. Sam 1 continues on down the corridor.
SAM 1: Gerty, what the hell is going on? Who is that guy in the Rec Room? Where did he come from? Why does he look like me?
GERTY: Sam, you're out of bed.
SAM 1: Yes, Gerty, I'm out of bed. Who is the guy in the rec room?
GERTY: Sam Bell.
SAM 1: Who the fuck is in the rec room, You are Sam Bell.
GERTY: You are Sam Bell.
SAM 1: I don't understand what's happening, Gerty. I think I may be losing my mind.
GERTY: We could run some tests. I haven't reported anything to central, Sam. They don't know you were recovered alive from the Recovered alive? What do you mean? Why haven't you reported to central?
SAM 1: Recovered alive? What do you mean? Why haven't you reported to central?
GERTY: I'm here to keep you safe, Sam. I want to help you. Are you
SAM 1: You're Sam Bell.
SAM 2: Sam 1 nods. A beat.
SAM 1: This is fucked up.
SAM 2: Sam 2 slapping down cards. Sam 1 desperately attempts to put together a coherent thought.
SAM 1: Why. What are you? I'm a clone, Sam. Im a fucking How long have you been here?
SAM 2: I'm a clone, Sam. Im a fucking How long have you been here?
SAM 1: How long have you been here?
SAM 2: About a week.
SAM 1: How are you getting on?
SAM 2: ( repeating the question How am I getting on? ( then ) The company ordered Gerty to lock all the exits. I haven't been able to do anything for seven days but sit on my ass.
SAM 1: They locked all the exits? What about the harvesters?
SAM 2: Slowed them down to half speed,
SAM 1: I'm not a clone.
SAM 2: Ok, Sam. You're not a clone.
SAM 1: You're the clone.
SAM 2: How long have you been here?
SAM 1: Almost three years.
SAM 2: Hence the Captain's beard.
SAM 1: ( with a smile ) I didn't know it could get so thick. Does it itch?
SAM 2: I didn't know it could get so thick. Does it itch?
SAM 1: No, not really.
SAM 2: ( self-conscious ) You look just like me. It's Why do I look like you? Why don't you look like me?
SAM 1: You look just like me. It's Why do I look like you? Why don't you look like me?
SAM 2: Why do I look like you? Why don't you look like me?
SAM 1: We look like each other, I guess.
SAM 1: Your serve.
SAM 2: SAM 1
SAM 1: Two points to eighteen.
SAM 2: Sam 2 slaps his paddle on his thigh, his temper creeping up on him. He catches Sam's eye. Gets a grip. Sam 1 is a better player than Sam 2. He's been up here longer. He's had more practice.
SAM 2: How long did it take you to do I don't remember doing all of it. I remember when I did the church and the Salvation Army. And a few of the people. My mind's been acting kind of weird lately, It's Fairfield, right? ( pointing ) There's Town Hall.
SAM 1: I don't remember doing all of it. I remember when I did the church and the Salvation Army. And a few of the people. My mind's been acting kind of weird lately, It's Fairfield, right? There's Town Hall.
SAM 2: It's Fairfield, right? There's Town Hall.
SAM 1: Uh-huh. You know Fairfield? That's the Baskin&Robbins. And there's Tess and Eve. Do you know
SAM 2: Yes. I know Tess.
SAM 1: You know about Eve, right?
SAM 2: We did? She thought she was going to have a boy. She was so sure.
SAM 1: She's beautiful. She's really How much did she weigh? Isn't that what you're supposed to ask, how much did she weigh?
SAM 2: How much did she weigh? Isn't that what you're supposed to ask, how much did she weigh?
SAM 1: Nine pounds, eleven ounces.
GERTY'S VOICE: Sam, a message has arrived from
OVERMEYERS: Greetings, Sam!
THOMPSON: How's our Man? Feeling better?
OVERMEYERS: You getting lots of rest?
THOMPSON: Yeah, you resting up, Sam? You'd better be you bastard.
OVERMEYERS: Enjoy it while it lasts! We've got good news.
THOMPSON: The Jupiter Program had to be put on hiatus, so we've got a few free pairs of hands
OVERMEYERS: We've managed to secure you a Rescue Unit ahead of schedule.
THOMPSON: Rescue Unit Eliza.
OVERMEYERS: They've been stationed on Goliath 19 for the last couple of months.
OVERMEYERS: Eliza is bringing you something special, Sam. Compliments of the A hooker!
THOMPSON: A hooker!
OVERMEYERS: No not a hooker. What's wrong with you? It's a little something to drink, Sam, that's all, our way of patting you on the back for all that you've been through.
THOMPSON: In the meantime, keep resting up, and hang in there.
OVERMEYERS: Yeah you hang in there, Sam. Over and out.
SAM 1: They're sending a Rescue Unit? To fix the stalled harvester. They didn't think I was up to it.
SAM 2: To fix the stalled harvester. They didn't think I was up to it.
SAM 1: Then I'm going back.
SAM 2: Is that what you really think?
SAM 1: I've got a contract
SAM 2: You're a fucking clone! You don't have shit!
SAM 1: I'm going home!
SAM 2: You're not going anywhere!
SAM 2: What, you think Tess is back home waiting for you? What about the original Sam?
SAM 1: I'm the original! I'm Sam fucking Bell! Me! Me!
GERTY: Yes, Sam.
SAM 2: What about the other clones?
SAM 1: That's ridiculous. Impossible. Why would hey do that?
SAM 2: I bet there's some kind of secret Secret room?
SAM 1: ( laughing ) Secret room?
SAM 2: Yeah, secret room, why not?
SAM 1: ( losing his cool ) You're the one who's lost the plot! I've been here for three years. I know every inch of this base. I know how many dust fibres are between those wall panels over there why would they do Look. It's a company, right? They have investors, shareholders shit like that. What's cheaper? Spending time and money training new personnel or just have a couple of spares here to do the job. If they make it through their contract, great. If they don't, hallelujah! No contract completion fees, no retirement package. Just thaw out the spare, and keep the profits rolling in. It's the far side of the Moon, Sam! The tight fuck's haven't even fixed our communications satellite.
SAM 2: Look. It's a company, right? They have investors, shareholders shit like that. What's cheaper? Spending time and money training new personnel or just have a couple of spares here to do the job. If they make it through their contract, great. If they don't, hallelujah! No contract completion fees, no retirement package. Just thaw out the spare, and keep the profits rolling in. It's the far side of the Moon, Sam! The tight fuck's haven't even fixed our communications satellite.
SAM 1: Tess would know.
SAM 2: Do you really think they give a shit about us? They're laughing all the way to the bank!
SAM 1: Tess would know what's going on! She wouldn't let that happen!
SAM 2: ( exhasperated ) There's some area we don't know about. I'm going to find it.
SAM 1: I told you.
SAM 2: Finally Sam 2 arrives before the model.
SAM 1: SAM 2
SAM 2: I want to check underneath there.
SAM 1: You're not moving the model.
SAM 2: Get the fuck out of my way!
SAM 1: Sam 1 is still holding the knife. Though he's not about to use it, both Sams are aware that it's there. Suddenly Sam 2 LUNGES for the knife; an INTENSE STRUGGLE ensues TEETH CLENCHED, sputtering BREATHS the two Sams less clones right now than ANIMALS.
SAM 2: You okay?
SAM 1: Get off me!
MIRROR: Sam 1 stares at his reflection in the mirror, holding a MOUND of TOILET PAPER against his NOSE. The blood flow has Suddenly Sam 1 sees the GIRL in the mirror. It gives him a hell of a FRIGHT. The Girl remains in the mirror looking at Sam 1. A neutral expression, impassive. Sam 1 takes a deep breath, lowers the toilet paper from his nose.
SAM 1: Who are you?
GERTY: Hello Sam.
SAM 1: Hi Gerty.
GERTY: Sam, is everything okay?
SAM 1: We had a fight. Me and the other guy, the other Sam. We had a fight, Gerty. He's a maniac. You know what he did? He flipped the entire model over. Do you know how much work I've put into that 938 hours.
GERTY: 938 hours.
SAM 1: 938 hours, exactly. Really? 938 hours.
GERTY: SAM 1 ( a beat )
SAM 1: ( a beat ) He scares me, Gerty.
GERTY: What is it about Sam that scares He flies off the handle. I see it now.I see what Tess was talking I've never told you this, Gerty, but she left me. Tess left me. For six months. She moved back in with her parents.
SAM 1: He flies off the handle. I see it now.I see what Tess was talking I've never told you this, Gerty, but she left me. Tess left me. For six months. She moved back in with her parents.
GERTY: I know.
SAM 1: ( beat ) It was the year before I came in here. She gave me a second chance. I promised her I'd You have changed, Sam.
GERTY: You have changed, Sam.
SAM 1: Yeah, I guess I have.
GERTY: Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
SAM 1: What about the messages she sent to me?
GERTY: Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base.
SAM 1: Gerty, am I really a clone?
GERTY: Sam, when you first arrived at Selene, there was a small crash. You woke up in the infirmary. You suffered minor brain damage and memory loss. I kept you under observation and ran some tests.
SAM 1: I remember.
GERTY: Sam, there was no crash. You were being awakened. It is standard procedure for all new clones to be given tests to establish mental stability and general physical health. Genetic abnormalities and minor duplication errors in the DNA can have considerable impact
SAM 1: And Tess? Eve?
GERTY: They are memory implants, Sam. I'm very sorry.
SAM 1: No thanks, Gerty.
SAM 1: You okay?
SAM 2: I'm staring into space. Get it?
SAM 1: A beat.
SAM 2: Listen, I went haywire before. I lost it. I'm sorry.
SAM 1: It's okay.
SAM 2: No it's not okay. I fucked up Fairfield your model that's unacceptable. I don't know what's wrong with me. I've got a temper. I need to do something about it.
SAM 1: Yes you do.
SAM 2: I've been thinking. That Rescue Unit Eliza they'll be here in less than fourteen hours. I don't know about you but I'd like to figure out where we stand before they get here.
SAM 1: SAM 2 ( then )
SAM 2: Ostensibly they're coming to deal with the stalled harvester. We both know that isn't true. They're coming to dig your body out of that rover. They think you're in there.
SAM 1: SAM 2
SAM 2: What'll their reaction be when they find out you survived the crash? I wasn't supposed to find you. Lunar instructed Gerty to lock me inside the base for Christ's sake.
SAM 1: A live conversation?
SAM 2: SAM 1
SAM 1: That's not possible.
SAM 2: No no no, it is possible. It's possible because I saw it, that's my point.
SAM 1: How do you know the conversation was live?
SAM 2: It was a back and forth exchange. And I saw Thompson and Overmeyers up on the monitor. I was supposed to be asleep in the Infirmary. The moment I walked into the comms room Gerty terminated the transmission. Now I was a little drugged up, granted, but I didn't imagine it.
SAM 1: The communications equipment is damaged there was a solar Tabitha, right.
SAM 2: SAM 1
SAM 1: Tabitha, right.
SAM 2: Lunar made it up. Maybe. I don't know. Bottom line is they don't want us to be able to contact Earth. Otherwise why would they have lied to us?
SAM 1: How are they blocking the live feed? The base's communications equipment works fine
SAM 2: Maybe they're not blocking the signal from inside the base.
SAM 1: From where then?
SAM 1: Just passing the last of the Harvesters looks like John
SAM 2: How long until you're out of the base's range?
SAM 1: If I maintain this speed.a minute. Ninety seconds tops.
SAM 2: You ever been this far out?
SAM 1: No, never.
SAM 1: You see anything yet?
SAM 2: Nothing. You?
SAM 1: There isn't shit out here.I feel like I'm about to drive off the end of the world. It would help if I knew what I was looking for.
SAM 2: What is it?
SAM 1: Don't know yet.
SAM 2: Antenna? Really? Hang on, looks like there's one on this side too.
SAM 1: Whoever built these things meant business. They weren't fucking What do you think?
SAM 2: Its not an antennae, dude. Its a No wonder we can't get a live feed. These things must be blocking our signal.
SAM 1: Yeah, I hear you. I'm going to head back to base. I'm not feeling too good.
SAM 2: I'll stay out here a little longer. I want to see if there are any more of these things.
SAM 1: He seizes the steering wheel, shakes it FIERCELY beginning to really LOSE IT
THE MIRROR: Sam 1 stands, moves to the mirror, opening his mouth wide to look for the missing teeth he uses his thumbs, shows his gums revealing: yes, he's lost at least a couple of He flushes the toilet.
SAM 1: ( on screen ) January 12th, Lunar hour 8:32. All Harvesters running smoothly today. Readouts are as follows: Matthew, 12.7 miles; Mark 11.9
SAM: ( on screen ) .John, 15.1 miles.sorry, I'm not feeling too hot today I'm going to have to continue this
SAM 4: .I've got blood coming out of my nose.
SAM 5: I don't feel too well, Old Man.
SAM 6: My hair's falling out.look it.
TECHNICIAN: .relax and breathe deeply. The cryo pod is designed to put you into a deep sleep for the duration of your three day return journey back to Earth. As you begin to get sleepy, think about the magnificent job you've done, and how proud your family are of what you've accomplished.
CUBBY: Sam 1 opens a cubby, swipes something similar to a CROW BAR, heads out of the frame
RETURN VEHICLE: Back in the Return Vehicle, Sam 1 stands over the panel in the floor. He uses the CROW BAR to prize the panel open this takes an extraordinary effort the panel eventually LIFTING like a manhole cover. Sam 1 can't believe his eyes. At the top of the OPEN PANEL, leading down into darkness.there's A LADDER.
SAM 2: I saw three more of those jammers. The base is surrounded. I printed out their coordinates
SAM 1: I found your secret room.
SAM 2: Who goes first?
SAM 2: Is there a light?
SAM 1: The cryo pod in the Return Vehicle is an incinerator.
SAM 2: SAM 1
SAM 1: We don't go home. We're burned to death up there. Then the company wakes up a new one. Every three years. Like clock work.
SAM 2: How do you know all this?
SAM 1: ( beat ) I hacked into the Old Man. Actually, Gerty did. I saw footage. You're right, there have been other clones before us.
SAM 2: How many?
SAM 1: A pause.
SAM 2: If that Rescue Unit finds the two of us awake at the same time, they'll kill us both for sure.
GERTY: Sam, can I help you with Not now, Gerty, okay? Gerty? Why did you help me? With the password? Doesn't that go against your programming or Helping you is what I do.
SAM 1: Not now, Gerty, okay? Gerty? Why did you help me? With the password? Doesn't that go against your programming or Helping you is what I do.
GERTY: Helping you is what I do.
SAM 2: What's going on?
SAM 1: There's something I've got to do.
WIDE SHOT: Sam's Rover approaches one of the many Jammers that we now know circle the perimeter of the base. Sam 1 stops the Rover on the other side of the Jammer. Here, outside the range of the Jammers, he figures he might be able to get a signal through to Earth. ON SAM as he removes his equipment from the backpack and starts to uncoil wires inserts a small BATTERY PACK onto the back of the VP, sits the VP on his lap. The VP resembles a Play Station Portable with its small but nonetheless high-quality screen. Sam isn't sure who to contact at first.finally he enters some numbers from memory. The VP shaking in his hands. He is nervous, scared. He disables the video mode on his end, so he is only sending audio. A moment of silence. The VP seems dead.
SAM 1: Come on.come on.
GIRL: That's never happened before. Sam 1 finally manages to The conversation has a very slight delay, maybe a second or two, and the Girl isn't completely clear on the monitor. We assume that these minor technical glitches are the same on the Girl's end. The Girl is sweet, chirpy nothing like the haunting, ghost-like figure from Sam 1's hallucinations.
SAM 1: Uh, Bell residence?
GIRL: This is the Bell Residence.
SAM 1: I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.
GIRL: I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.
SAM 1: No.no way.
GIRL: Uh, yeah, I think so. I'm her Can I help you?
SAM 1: Sam 1 can't believe it. She's beautiful. She's beautiful.
EVE BELL: A moment. Eve looking more closely, trying to decipher Sam 1's face. Tears glistening in his eyes.
SAM 1: ( overwhelmed ) Hi. Hi. Eve. How old are you
EVE BELL: I'm fifteen. Do I know you?
SAM 1: How did mom die, sweetheart?
EVE BELL: Now Eve is beginning to look spooked. She turns away from the screen and calls to someone in another room:
EVE BELL: Dad, there's someone asking about
SAM'S VOICE: Who's asking about mom?
SAM 1: Want me to help?
SAM 2: Barbara Streisand?
SAM 1: ( with a smile ) He looked like Barbara Streisand. We used to hide his Bible when he passed out. Drove the guy nuts.
SAM 2: How do you carve these things?
SAM 1: Want me to show you?
SAM 2: You're shaking.
SAM 1: Watch what I'm doing. You watching?
SAM 2: SAM 1
SAM 1: Now you try.
SAM 2: I suck.
SAM 1: You'll get the hang of it. You see, that's a little better
SAM 2: What's happening to you?
SAM 1: I think I'm dying.
SAM 2: What do you think it is?
SAM 1: Maybe we don't live that long. Maybe we start to decompose or
SAM 2: Suddenly Sam 1 closes his eyes SWAYS looks like he's going to pass out.
SAM 1: ( grim smile ) No tranqs. I don't think I would ever wake up again.
EVE: This is the Bell residence.
SAM 2: ( commenting as he No you didn't.
EVE: I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago. SAM 1 ( O.S. ) SAM 2
EVE: Uh, yeah, I think so, I'm her Can I help you?
SAM 2: Gerty, I need to talk to you.
GERTY: Of course, Sam, how can I help?
SAM 2: We found the hidden room. We know about the other clones.
GERTY: I don't know of a hidden room.
SAM 2: The hidden room under the Return Vehicle, Gerty. You know what I'm talking about. We found it on our own. Lunar doesn't know anything about it.
GERTY: The lower deck is out of bounds to awakened clones
SAM 2: Ordinarily, Gerty, but what with there being two of us awake at the same time, and what with the situation being unprecedented, the rules have had to change. Do you understand?
GERTY: I understand the situation is Gerty, how long does it take for a clone to wake up?
SAM 2: ( a beat ) Gerty, how long does it take for a clone to wake up?
GERTY: A clone is awake the moment his pod is opened. But he is not fully conscious for several
SAM 2: Gerty, we need to wake up a new I am not permitted to do that, If we don't wake up another clone me and the other Sam will die. We'll die, Gerty. Do you
GERTY: I am not permitted to do that, If we don't wake up another clone me and the other Sam will die. We'll die, Gerty. Do you
SAM 2: If we don't wake up another clone me and the other Sam will die. We'll die, Gerty. Do you
GERTY: SAM 2
SAM 2: Do you want me and the other Sam to die?
GERTY: That is the last thing I want.
SAM 2: Then you have to wake up a new clone. Okay, pal?
SAM 2: Don't touch him.
SAM 1: Sam 2 puts his finger to his lips. Then:
SAM 2: Come to the Rec Room.
SAM 2: When the Rescue Unit arrives they'll expect to find a body in the crashed Rover, right? We've got our body.
SAM 1: ( points towards the That guy?
SAM 2: I know.
SAM 1: ( stunned ) You're going to kill him?
SAM 2: Someone's got to pull the short straw here, better someone who's unconscious than you or me.
SAM 1: What about us? Eliza arrives, finds you and me as the welcome They're not going to find you and me as the welcome party, they're going to find me. You're going to blast back to Earth before they get here in one of the Helium 3 You're going home.
SAM 2: They're not going to find you and me as the welcome party, they're going to find me. You're going to blast back to Earth before they get here in one of the Helium 3 You're going home.
SAM 1: How do you think she died?
SAM 2: I don't know. Jane died of cancer. I mean, it was in the family. Who knows? Or maybe it was an accident? Could have been a million things.
SAM 1: I wish I'd been there.
SAM 2: Yeah. Me too.
SAM 2: Go for it.
SAM 1: Sam 2 chuckles.
SAM 2: But you fit. That's good. You
SAM 2: Sam Bell reporting to Central. 19:14 Pacific Time. Lunar Day 14. Evening Overmeyers, evening Thompson! According to the Old Man Rescue Unit Eliza will be here in just over three hours. Not a moment too soon! I never thought I'd say this, but I want to get out there, I want to work. I feel like a kid who's been grounded. Looking forward to Eliza straightening everything out and things getting back to normal around here. Well.that's it. I'll let you know how it goes. Over and out, gentlemen.
TESS: Come on!
SAM 2: We need to do it. We need to do it now. He'll be conscious any We've been putting it off for long enough.
SAM 1: We don't have to do anything. I changed my mind.
SAM 2: What are you talking about? She's your daughter, man! She's not going to care what you.
SAM 1: ( angry ) She's not! She's not. my daughter. At least, I'm not her father. Not to her.
SAM 2: This is wrong. What are we supposed to do? Sit around here and wait to die? Fuck that!
SAM 1: I don't know. It's what we were designed to do.
SAM 2: Screw that! I'll go! .And I'm going to find this asshole, Sam Bell, and ask him why the hell he put us through this shit!
SAM 1: You're a good guy, Sam.
SAM 2: I might stop shaving; It suits If all our memories are implants, no disrespect, but I think its about time I got some of my own, as well.
SAM 1: Yeah. You should travel. I've always wanted to do that.
SAM 2: I'd like that.
MATTHEW: Where all the trouble really started. Matthew, the stalled Harvester, with the crashed Rover still trapped beneath it. The crash site is beginning to resemble some old underwater The Rover enters the frame, beginning to slow down as it approaches the crash site. Sam 2 rolls the Rover to a standstill about ten feet from the front of the Harvester.
SAM 1: Tess came in for the interview,
SAM 2: She was going back to San You knew you had to take a chance. So you called her. You were terrified and wrote that whole speech for her answer But I didn't need it because Tess answered the phone. And I could tell in her voice as we talked, she was thinking. "Why has Sam called me?" "The internship's over, why's he called me at home?" And then I asked her if she was going to Adrian Fiddle's barbecue
SAM 2: How long before he's conscious, The new clone will be conscious within one hour.
GERTY: The new clone will be conscious within one hour.
SAM 2: That's good. That's very good.
GERTY: Sam? Where is Sam?
SAM 2: He's gone home, Gerty.
GERTY: Sam, this is not going to work.
SAM 2: What? Why not?
GERTY: If the Rescue Unit examine my memory banks they will discover what has taken place over the last week. As you know I record everything. If they are suspicious, the first thing they will do is search my memory banks, and this would put you in considerable danger.
SAM 2: So that's what we're going to have to do. Are you ok with that?
GERTY: I'll require your assistance, Sure, just let me finish this.
SAM 2: Sure, just let me finish this.
TESS: Come on, Sam! Sam Bell! Come on!
SAM 2: I've set your computer to reboot the second I've blasted off.
GERTY: Okay, Sam.
SAM 2: Thanks for all your help, Gerty. I wish I could say I was going to miss you, buddy, but to be honest, I can't wait to get away from here.
GERTY: I understand, Sam. I hope life is everything you remember it to Thanks. Are you sure you're going to be ok?
SAM 2: Thanks. Are you sure you're going to be ok?
GERTY: Of course. The new Sam and I will be back to our programming as soon as I have finished Gerty, I'm not programmed.
SAM 2: Gerty, I'm not programmed.
SAM 2: Pounds the delete button, continuing to type coordinates into the Old Man He's done! He leaps out of his chair and tears off through the base towards the cargo container.
SAM 3: Where am I?
GERTY: Sam, you're in the Infirmary. You had an accident.
SAM 3: No, Gerty. I don't remember a thing.
TESS: What took you so long?
