FADE IN: EXTERIOR - MONTAGE 1. Quick shots of a car speeding around curves in a mountainous region. The car jumps a bridge, hurtles into space, crashes in a fireball. Followed by newsboys hawking special editions, people on streetcorners buying and reading newspapers with a succession of banner headlines:
ITALY,": "CIVIC LEADER KILLED IN AUTO ACCIDENT," "DISCLOSURE OF BANKER'S WILL AWAITED" and finally "SEMPLE HEIR AS YET UNKNOWN"
MAC: Say listen, Corny, who do you think you're talking to? If the Semple attorneys don't know who the heir is, who does?
COBB: ( on the phone )

COBB: ( covering mouthpiece - confidentially )
CEDAR: ( firmly )
COBB: ( returning to the phone )
CEDAR: ( more firmly )
COBB: ( continuing )
CEDAR: ( barely glancing up )
COBB: But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
CEDAR: Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him.
COBB: ( resignedly )
ANDERSON: We located him, Mr. Cedar! We found out where he is.
CEDAR: FIRST BROTHER Yes, John, we got him.
FIRST BROTHER: Yes, John, we got him.
ANDERSON: Here's the report: Longfellow Deeds, single, 28, lives in Mandrake Falls, ( glancing at the report )
CEDAR: ( glancing at the report )
FIRST BROTHER: Better wire him right away, John.
CEDAR: I'll do no such thing. I'm going there myself. You're going with me too, Anderson - and you too, Cobb.
VOICE: Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
CEDAR: Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
VOICE: ( skeptically )
CEDAR: Mandrake Falls.
COBB'S VOICE: Welcome to Mandrake Falls -
COBB: That's pretty.
CEDAR: Are you sure this is the town he lives Yes sir, Mr. Cedar. This is the town all right.
ANDERSON: Yes sir, Mr. Cedar. This is the town all right.
CEDAR: Well, I dropped everything at the office - I hope it's not a wild goose chase.
ANDERSON: No, sir. We checked it thoroughly. He lives here all right.
COBB: Ah! I spy a native. Let's ask him.
CEDAR: ( as they approach )
AGENT: ( glances up )
COBB: That's an excellent start. At least we've broken the ice.
CEDAR: I say, my friend, do you know a fellow by the name of Longfellow Deeds?
AGENT: Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy. Everyone knows Yes, I
CEDAR: Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy. Everyone knows Yes, I
AGENT: Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy. Everyone knows Yes, I
CEDAR: Yes, I
COBB: Must be a game he's playing.
CEDAR: We'd like to get in touch with him. It's very important.
AGENT: Who's that?
CEDAR: Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking Oh, yes - Deeds. Fine fellow. Very democratic. You won't have no trouble at all. Talk to anybody.
AGENT: Oh, yes - Deeds. Fine fellow. Very democratic. You won't have no trouble at all. Talk to anybody.
CEDAR: I guess we'd better try somebody else.
COBB: No, we won't! The next time that jumping jack comes out, I'll straddle him while you ask him your questions.
AGENT: Morning, neighbors.
COBB ): Cobb grabs the old man as he turns to head back into the building.
COBB: Remember us? We're the fellows who were here a minute ago.
AGENT: Oh, yes. Yes, indeedy. I never forget a face.
COBB: Listen, Pop, we've come all the way from New York to look up a fellow by the name of Deeds. It's important - very important!
AGENT: ( releasing his arm )
COBB: Then please pretend, for just one fleeting moment, that I'm asking. Where does he reside?
AGENT: Cobb turns away in disgust. Anderson steps forward.
ANDERSON: Longfellow Deeds - where does he live?
AGENT: Oh, that's what you want! Well, why didn't you say so in the first place instead of beating around the bush? Those other fellows don't know what they're talking about.
MRS. MEREDITH: Oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?
CEDAR: Is Mr. Deeds in?
MRS. MEREDITH: No - he's over to the park arranging for the bazaar, so's to raise money for the fire engine.
AGENT: Knew it all the time. But these men said they wanted to see the house.
MRS. MEREDITH: Come in, please. Come in. Can I get you a cup of tea?
CEDAR: No, thanks.
MRS. MEREDITH: Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
CEDAR: That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
MRS. MEREDITH: No, I'm his housekeeper.
CEDAR: Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
MRS. MEREDITH: He and Jim Mason own the Tallow Works. But that's not where he makes his money. He makes most of it from his poetry.
COBB: ( skeptically )
MRS. MEREDITH: Oh, my goodness, yes. Longfellow's famous. He writes all those things on postcards. You know, for Christmas - and Easter - and birthdays. Sit down, please.
MRS. MEREDITH: Here's one - he got $25 for this one.
MRS. MEREDITH: "When you've nowhere to turn - and you're filled with doubt -
COBB: ( flatly )
MRS. MEREDITH: ( as she heads toward the door )
COBB: ( to Cedar - sotto voce )
MRS. MEREDITH: They've been waiting a long while.
LONGFELLOW: Who are they?
MRS. MEREDITH: I don't know.
CEDAR: ( standing - formally )
LONGFELLOW: How do you do.
CEDAR: How do you do.
LONGFELLOW: ( shaking hands )
CEDAR: ( extending card )
LONGFELLOW: ( reads to himself )
CEDAR: Mr. Cornelius Cobb and Mr. Anderson.
LONGFELLOW: You gentlemen make yourselves comfortable.
LONGFELLOW: New mouthpiece. Been waiting two weeks for this. Kids keep swiping them all the time. They use 'em for bean shooters.
MRS. MEREDITH: You gentlemen going to stay for lunch?
CEDAR: ( right to the point; ignoring her )
LONGFELLOW: All right.
CEDAR: Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?
LONGFELLOW: Are your parents living?
CEDAR: Are your parents living?
LONGFELLOW: Why, no.
CEDAR: Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
LONGFELLOW: Not much. He's an uncle of mine, I think. I never saw him, but my mother's name was Semple, you know.
CEDAR: Well, he passed on. He was killed in a motor accident in Italy.
LONGFELLOW: He was? Gee, that's too bad. If there's anything I can do to
CEDAR: I have good news for you, sir. Mr. Semple left a large fortune when he died. He left it all to you, Mr. Deeds. Deducting the taxes, it amounts to something in the neighborhood of $20,000,000.
MRS. MEREDITH: How about lunch? Are the gentlemen going to stay - or not?
LONGFELLOW: Of course they're going to stay.
CEDAR: ( over the noise of the tuba )
LONGFELLOW: Oh, yes, I heard you all right. $20,000,000. That's quite a lot, isn't it?
COBB: Oh, it'll do in a pinch.
LONGFELLOW: ( impressed )
CEDAR: Mr. Cobb here is an ex-newspaperman associated with your uncle for many years - as a sort of buffer.
LONGFELLOW: Yeah. A glorified doormat.
COBB: Yeah. A glorified doormat.
CEDAR: Yes. You see, rich people need someone to keep the crowds away. The world's full of pests. Then there's the newspapers to handle. One must know when to seek publicity - and when to avoid it.
LONGFELLOW: Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington.
COBB: Why should you?
LONGFELLOW: Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
COBB: I've got one for Cobb
LONGFELLOW: I've got one for Cobb
LONGFELLOW: "There once was a man named Cobb,
COBB: Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
LONGFELLOW: I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
COBB: I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
LONGFELLOW: Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
COBB: Oh, that's different if it's just poetry.
CEDAR: Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds?
LONGFELLOW: Who - me? No.
MRS. MEREDITH: No, he's too fussy for that. That's what's the matter with him. There are lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls who're dying to be married
LONGFELLOW: Don't pay any attention to her.
MRS. MEREDITH: He's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.
LONGFELLOW: Now you keep out of this!
CEDAR: ( diplomatically )
LONGFELLOW: What for?
CEDAR: You're going to New York with us.
LONGFELLOW: This afternoon - at four o'clock.
COBB: This afternoon - at four o'clock.
LONGFELLOW: I don't think we've got any suitcases.
MRS. MEREDITH: Well, we could borrow a couple from Mrs. Simpson. You know, she went to Niagara Falls last year.
LONGFELLOW: I'm kind of nervous. I've never been away from Mandrake Falls in my life. Kind of like to see Grant's Tomb, though.
CEDAR: ( all business )
COBB: See you later, kid.
ANDERSON'S VOICE: ( as he too exits )
LONGFELLOW: Hear what he said? You know how much twenty million is?
MRS. MEREDITH: I don't care how much it is. You sit right there and eat your lunch. You haven't touched a thing.

LONGFELLOW DEEDS: THE PRIDE OF MANDRAKE FALLS 25. MEDIUM SHOT - CEDAR AND ANDERSON They peer anxiously around, looking for someone, when Cobb dashes in.
COBB: ( breathlessly )
CEDAR: You can't?
COBB: I looked everywhere. I even went to his house. It's locked up.
ANDERSON: He probably had a change of heart.
CEDAR: He wasn't very anxious to come in the first place.
COBB: ( looking on )
COBB: That tuba player!
CEDAR: That tuba player!
COBB: That tuba player!
COBB: Well, now I've seen everything.
LONGFELLOW: Goodbye, Mrs. Meredith! Goodbye, Jim! Bye, Buddy! Goodbye, everybody!
COBB: ( opening a snifter - generously )
LONGFELLOW: ( distractedly )
CEDAR: Will you have a cigar?
LONGFELLOW: No, thank you.
CEDAR: ( breaking the silence )
LONGFELLOW: Oh, I wasn't worried about that.
CEDAR: I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.
LONGFELLOW: I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.

MAN'S VOICE: ( as Cedar passes by )
CEDAR: ( as he walks briskly )
CEDAR: ( to a secretary as he passes )
SECRETARY: Good morning, Mr. Cedar.
CEDAR: Good morning. Where are they?
SECRETARY: Waiting for you in the other office.
CEDAR: ( beaming )
MEN: ( ad lib )
CEDAR: We've got nothing to worry about. He's as naive as a child.
BUDINGTON: Close that door.
CEDAR: Close that door.
FIRST BROTHER: Come on, John. What happened?
CEDAR: ( to associates )
BUDINGTON: ( anxiously )
CEDAR: ( interrupting )
CEDAR: He said he guessed he'd give it away.
BUDINGTON: John, if you don't mind my saying so - we can't afford to
CEDAR: ( irascibly )
BUDINGTON: But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh
CEDAR: Well, it hasn't happened yet - has it?
BUDINGTON: ( wailing )
CEDAR: ( exploding )
WIFE: A yokel! Nothing but a yokel! Your uncle must have been mad to leave all that money to him! You're as closely related to him as he is, and what did you get?
WIFE: ( slaps the paper George is reading )
GEORGE: Stop yelling. Can I help it if my uncle didn't like me?
WIFE: I told you to be nice to him. Ten years we've been waiting for that old man to kick off. And then we were going to be on Easy Street. Yeah - on Easy Oh, shut up! It's too late now, and you're a nuisance!
GEORGE: Oh, shut up! It's too late now, and you're a nuisance!
WIFE: That's just what I'm going to be - a nuisance. I'm going to be a nuisance until I get hold of some of that money!
MAC: ( as he blows his nose )
MAC: He's been here three days, and what have you numbskulls brought in! Any halfwit novice could have done better!
REPORTER'S VOICE: Yeah, we tried too
MAC: Am I talking too loud? Or annoying anybody?
REPORTER: You know Corny Cobb. He's keeping him under lock and key.
MAC: Cobb, Cobb! Never mind about Cobb. Use what little brains you've got! Find out something yourselves, you imbecilic stupes! Now get out of here before I really tell you what I think of you. Come on, get out!
REPORTER: ( Mumbles. )
MAC: ( alert )
REPORTER: ( thinking fast - covering up )
MAC: You too! Thought I could depend on you, but you're getting as bad as the rest of them.
BABE: ( flicking the string )
MAC: What's gotten into you, Babe? I remember the time when you'd blast this town wide open before you'd let Cobb get away with a thing like this.
BABE: Oh, he's not getting away with anything.
MAC: ( excited )
BABE: Can I have a month's vacation?
MAC: With pay!
BABE: With pay!
MAC: ( casually, as she starts away )
BABE: ( casually, as she starts away )
MAC: Now you're talking, Babe. I'll keep the whole front page open. What are you going to do?
BABE: ( at door )
LONGFELLOW: It's the first time I ever had a suit made on purpose.
CEDAR: It's merely a suggestion. I don't wish to press the point, Mr. Deeds, but if you'll give me your Power of Attorney we'll take care of everything. It'll save you a lot of petty annoyances. Every shark in town will be trying to sell you something.
LONGFELLOW: Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet.
CEDAR: Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds.
LONGFELLOW: Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
CEDAR: Yes. That is to say
LONGFELLOW: Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
CEDAR: ( too quickly )
LONGFELLOW: That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't ( generously )
CEDAR: ( generously )
LONGFELLOW: Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington yet.
BUTLER: The gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room, sir. They're getting a trifle impatient, sir.
LONGFELLOW: They are? I forgot all about them.
CEDAR: Well, your uncle was Chairman of the Board of Directors. They probably expect you to carry on.
COBB: ( rising )
LONGFELLOW: ( suddenly )
COBB: Jim Mason? Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't send it. I've got it written out, though. Here it is.
LONGFELLOW: Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
COBB: Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire He was the last baby my father delivered, Arthur was.
LONGFELLOW: He was the last baby my father delivered, Arthur was.
CEDAR: I think you ought to give this matter some thought, Mr. Deeds.
LONGFELLOW: I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
CEDAR: I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
LONGFELLOW: Oh, yes. Yes, I will.
LONGFELLOW: I'll give it a lot of thought. There was a fellow named Winslow here a little while ago, wanted to handle my affairs for nothing too. It puzzles me why these people all want to work for nothing. It isn't natural. So I guess I'd better think about it some more.
TAILOR: That's that.
LONGFELLOW: You go to an awful lot of work to keep a fellow warm, don't you?
TAILOR: Yes, sir.
BUTLER: A Mr. Hallor to see you sir.
CEDAR: ( quickly )
BUTLER: Yes, sir.
CEDAR: Well, don't let him in.
LONGFELLOW: Why not? Who is he?
CEDAR: A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate.
LONGFELLOW: Well, if he has a claim, we'd better see him.
CEDAR: He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds.
LONGFELLOW: How can he make any trouble for me? I haven't done anything.
CEDAR: I thought I told you to take up this matter with me, Hallor.
HALLOR: I'm a little tired of being pushed around by you, Mr. Cedar - I don't care how important you are.
LONGFELLOW: ( eyebrows raised )
HALLOR: Yes. Your uncle's common-law wife. She has a legal claim on the estate.
CEDAR: We'll let the courts decide what her legal position is.
HALLOR: You wouldn't dare go into court with a case like this - and you know it!
HALLOR: I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
LONGFELLOW: What kind of wife did you say she was?
HALLOR: Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.
LONGFELLOW: A child? My uncle's?
HALLOR: Yes, sir.
LONGFELLOW: That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
HALLOR: ( pleased )
LONGFELLOW: If she was his wife, she should have all the money. That's only fair. I don't want a penny of it.
CEDAR: Don't make any rash promises
COBB: You'd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from "Lucia."[2]
LONGFELLOW: ( to Hallor )
HALLOR: Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
LONGFELLOW: ( getting into robe - to Hallor )
LONGFELLOW: Gee, I'm busy. Did the opera people always come here for their meetings?
COBB: That's funny. Why is that?
LONGFELLOW: That's funny. Why is that?
COBB: ( wisely )
DOUGLAS: From what I'm led to believe, the young man's quite childish. I don't think we'll have any difficulty in getting him to put up the entire amount. After all, it's only a matter of $180,000.
DOUGLAS: ( slyly )
MAN: ( who has been watching at door )
DOUGLAS: There is a shuffle of preparation.
DOUGLAS: Now, gentlemen, the first order of business will be the election of a new Chairman of the Board.
A MAN: ( rising )

DOUGLAS: All those in favor . . .
EVERYBODY: ( rises )
DOUGLAS: ( rises )
LONGFELLOW: ( self-consciously )
DOUGLAS: ( humoring a child )
LONGFELLOW: ( to Cobb )
COBB: ( dryly )
DOUGLAS: Right here, Mr. Deeds.
DOUGLAS: Now, the next order of business is the reading of the Secretary's minutes .
A VOICE: Move we dispense with it.
ANOTHER VOICE: All in favor?
DOUGLAS: All in favor?
DOUGLAS: I think they can be dispensed with. We're ready now for the reading of the Treasurer's report.
A VOICE: Move we dispense with it.
ANOTHER VOICE: All in favor?
DOUGLAS: All in favor?
DOUGLAS: Quite right! Now, gentlemen, the next business will be
LONGFELLOW: Wait a minute. What does the Chairman Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings.
DOUGLAS: Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings.
LONGFELLOW: That's what I thought. If you don't mind, I'm rather interested in the Treasurer's report. I'd like to hear it.
TREASURER: The treasurer reports a deficit of $180,000 for the current year.
LONGFELLOW: A deficit! You mean we've lost that 61. WIDER ANGLE To include all at table.
DOUGLAS: You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted for profit.
LONGFELLOW: It isn't? What is it conducted for?
DOUGLAS: Why, it's an artistic institution
LONGFELLOW: We own an opera house, don't we?
A VOICE: We do.
LONGFELLOW: And we give shows?
DOUGLAS: We provide opera.
LONGFELLOW: But you charge. I mean, you sell tickets?
VOICE: Of course.
LONGFELLOW: And it doesn't pay?
DOUGLAS: That's impossible. The opera has never ( conclusively )
LONGFELLOW: ( conclusively )
DOUGLAS: The wrong kind! There isn't any wrong or right kind. Opera is opera!
LONGFELLOW: I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
DOUGLAS: Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
LONGFELLOW: Excuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing natural about that .
DOUGLAS: Excuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing natural about that .
LONGFELLOW: Excuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing natural about that .
LONGFELLOW: Hey, a fire engine!
LONGFELLOW: ( admiringly )
LONGFELLOW: Now, where were we?
DOUGLAS: You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
LONGFELLOW: Why not?
DOUGLAS: Because it just isn't a business, that's ? 364 ? Well, maybe it isn't to you, but it certainly is a business to me, if I have to make up a loss of $180,000. If it's losing that much money, there must be something wrong. Maybe you charge too much. Maybe you're selling bad merchandise. Maybe lots of things. I don't know. You see, I expect to do a lot of good with that money. And I can't afford to put it into anything that I don't look into. That's my decision for the time being, gentlemen. Goodbye, and thank you for making me Chairman.

COBB: Gentlemen, you'll find the smelling salts in the medicine chest.
LONGFELLOW: Sorry to keep you waiting so long. Those opera people are funny. They wanted me to put up $180,000.
HALLOR: What about it, Mr. Deeds?
LONGFELLOW: Why, I turned them down, naturally.
HALLOR: No, I mean - about my client.
LONGFELLOW: Oh - we'll have to do something about the common wife.
WALTER: Tails tonight, sir?
LONGFELLOW: What - tails?
WALTER: Yes, sir.
TAILOR: ( shaking hands with Longfellow )
LONGFELLOW: ( turning to the others )
HALLOR: Of course, we don't want to appear greedy, Mr. Deeds.
LONGFELLOW: I say we don't want to appear greedy.
HALLOR: I say we don't want to appear greedy.
LONGFELLOW: Oh. That.
LONGFELLOW: What do you think you're doing?
WALTER: Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
LONGFELLOW: Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!

HALLOR: Mrs. Semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.
LONGFELLOW: ( to Walter )
WALTER: No, sir.
LONGFELLOW: ( to Hallor )
HALLOR: Mrs. Semple is entitled to one-third of the estate.
LONGFELLOW: One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't ( quietly )
HALLOR: ( quietly )
CEDAR: If there's any talk of settlement, Hallor, take it up with me at the office.
HALLOR: I'll do no such thing
LONGFELLOW: That's right. Don't you go to his office. There's only one place you're going, and that's out the door.
HALLOR: You're making a mistake, Mr. Deeds.
LONGFELLOW: Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
HALLOR: Now wait a minute, buddy
LONGFELLOW: There's one nice thing about being rich - you ring a bell and things happen. When the servant comes in, Mr. Hallor, I'm going to ask him to show you to the door. Many people don't know where it is.
HALLOR: No use in getting tough. That'll get you nowhere, Mr. Deeds.
LONGFELLOW: Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front Yes, sir.
BUTLER: Yes, sir.
LONGFELLOW: And listen, there isn't any wife - there aren't any letters - and I think you're a crook. So you better watch your step.
COBB: I can't hold out on you any longer. Lamb bites wolf.
LONGFELLOW: Only common sense.
CEDAR: ( a forced smile )
LONGFELLOW: You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
CEDAR: Yes, of course, if you wish. But you must be prepared. This sort of thing will be daily routine.
LONGFELLOW: Even his hands are oily.

LONGFELLOW: Why yes. Isn't that all right?
2ND BODYGUARD: No. Don't ever want to go out without telling us.
LONGFELLOW: Who are you?
BODYGUARDS: We're your bodyguards.
LONGFELLOW: Oh, yeah.
2ND BODYGUARD: Yeah, Mr. Cobb said stick to your tail no matter what.
LONGFELLOW: That's very nice of Mr. Cobb - but I don't want anybody sticking to my tail no matter what.
FIRST BODYGUARD: Sorry, mister. Orders is orders.
LONGFELLOW: Is that so?

LONGFELLOW: Feel better now?
BABE: Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
LONGFELLOW: Tell me more about yourself.
BABE: Well, I guess I've told you almost everything there is to tell. My folks live in a small town near Hartford. I'm down here alone trying to make a living.
BABE: ( as the musician finishes and strolls away )
LONGFELLOW: You were a lady in distress, weren't ( looks up )
BABE: ( looks up )
LONGFELLOW: Oh - uh - nothing.
LONGFELLOW: Waiter! Has anybody come in yet?
WAITER: Huh? On, no. Nobody important.
LONGFELLOW: Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't I'm a writer myself, you know.
WAITER: I'm a writer myself, you know.
LONGFELLOW: I'm a writer myself, you know.
WAITER: I write poetry.
LONGFELLOW: I write poetry.
WAITER: He exits.
BABE: You've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you? All those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?
LONGFELLOW: No. That is, I didn't
WAITER: Brookfield just came in.
LONGFELLOW: Oh, the poet? Where?
WAITER: Over at that big round table. The one that looks like a poodle.
LONGFELLOW: ( to Babe )
BABE: ( looks also )
WAITER: ( confidentially - indicating Longfellow )
BROOKFIELD: Oh, yes. I read about him. He writes poetry on postcards.
HENABERRY: Let's invite him over. Might get a couple of laughs. Getting rather dull around It's always dull here.
MORROW: It's always dull here.
BROOKFIELD: ( rising )
HENABERRY: ? 375 ? DISSOLVE TO: 91. MED. SHOT - ROUND TABLE At which they are all seated now. Babe sits next to Longfellow, who is the center of attraction. Brookfield is just finishing introductions.
BROOKFIELD: Henaberry, Mr. Morrow, Bill - this is Mr. Deeds and his fiancée from Mandrake THE GROUP ( ad-lib )
THE GROUP: ( ad-lib )
LONGFELLOW: Nice of you to ask us to come and sit with you. Back home we never get a chance to meet famous people.
BILL: ( calling waiter )
THE GROUP: ( ad-lib )
HENABERRY: He's a poet. Have a drink.
LONGFELLOW: No - I don't want it, thank you.
HENABERRY: Why, you must drink! All poets drink!
BILL: Tell us, Mr. Deeds. How do you go about writing your poems? We craftsmen are very interested in one another's methods.
HENABERRY: Yes. Do you have to wait for an inspiration, or do you just dash it off?
LONGFELLOW: ( self-consciously )
HENABERRY: Mr. Morrow, over there, for instance, just dashes them off.
MORROW: Yes. That's what my publishers have been complaining about.
LONGFELLOW: ( laughing feebly )
MORROW'S VOICE: Oh, thanks. Thanks.
BROOKFIELD: How about you, Mr. Deeds?
LONGFELLOW: Well, I write mine on order. The people I work for just tell me what they want and then I go to work and write it.
BROOKFIELD: Amazing! Why, that's true genius!
HENABERRY: Yes. Have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating?
LONGFELLOW: Well, I play the tuba.
MORROW: I've been playing the harmonica for forty years - didn't do me a bit of 94. CLOSE SHOT - GROUP You wouldn't have one in your pocket, would you, Mr. Deeds?
BROOKFIELD: You wouldn't have one in your pocket, would you, Mr. Deeds?
LONGFELLOW: ( smiling )
BROOKFIELD: No, a postcard - with one of your poems on it.
LONGFELLOW: ( his face sober )
HENABERRY: You mean to tell me you don't carry a pocketful around with you?
BROOKFIELD: Too bad! I was hoping you'd autograph one for me.
HENABERRY: I was too.
BILL: Quite right.
HENABERRY: Wait a minute, boys. Perhaps Mr. Deeds would recite one for us.
BROOKFIELD: That's a very good idea. Nothing like a poet reciting his own stuff.
HENABERRY: Exactly! Give us one that wrings the great American heart.
THE GROUP: ( ad-lib )
LONGFELLOW: ( deeply hurt )
SEVERAL VOICES: ( ad-lib )
HENABERRY: Look, he's temperamental.
LONGFELLOW: ( levelling off at him )
LONGFELLOW: ( simply )
LONGFELLOW: I guess maybe it is comical to write poems for postcards, but a lot of people think they're good. Anyway, it's the best I can do. So if you'll excuse me, we'll be leaving. I guess I found out that all famous people - aren't big people . . .
LONGFELLOW: ( turning to them )
BABE: ( quickly )
LONGFELLOW: Then I guess maybe I will.
WAITER: ( calling out )
MORROW: ( an outcry )
WAITER: Step aside, step aside!
MORROW: ( obviously groggy with drink )
LONGFELLOW: That's all right. I got it off my chest.
MORROW: The difference between them and me is I know when I've been a skunk. You take me to the nearest news-stand and I'll eat a pack of your postcards raw. Raw!
MORROW: Oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness. Pal, you've added ten years to my life! A poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious! Delicious! You're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity!
LONGFELLOW: Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
MORROW: Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet
LONGFELLOW: I'd kind of like to see Grant's Tomb - and the Statue of Liberty.
MORROW: Well, you'll not only see those, but before the evening's half through, you'll be leaning against the Leaning Tower of Pisa - you'll mount Mt. Everest. I'll show you the Pyramids and all the little Pyramiddes, leaping from sphinx to sphinx. Pal, how would you like to go on a real, old-fashioned binge?
LONGFELLOW: ( puzzled )
MORROW: Yes. I mean the real McCoy. Listen, you play saloon with me, and I'll introduce you to every wit, every nit-wit, and every half-wit in New York. We'll go on a twister that'll make Omar the soused philosopher of Persia[7] look like an anemic on a goat's milk diet.
LONGFELLOW: ( vaguely )
MORROW: Fun? Say, listen, I'll take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and joy forever.
MORROW: ( to the world in general )
WOMAN: Oh, you're drunk.
MORROW: ( unmindful )
LONGFELLOW: ( to Babe )
BABE: Yes, I guess we will.
MAC: ( reads )
MAC: Cinderella Man! That's sensational, Babe! Sensational!
BABE: It took some high-powered acting, believe Did it?
MAC: Did it?
BABE: I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
MAC: Is he really that big a sap?
BABE: He's the original. There are no carbon copies of that one.
MAC: Cinderella Man! Babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. Can you imagine Cobb's face when he reads this?
BABE: If we could sell tickets, we'd make a fortune.
MAC: How'd you get the picture?
BABE: Had the boys follow us.
MAC: ( reads again )
BABE: I don't know. I had to duck to get the story out. He was so far along he never even missed me.
MAC: When're you going to see him again?
BABE: Tonight, maybe.
MAC: ( laughing )
BABE: I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.
MAC: ( all excited )
BABE: ( sidestepping )
MAC: ? 383 ? With pay!
BABE: With pay!
MAC: ( yelling after her )
WALTER: Mr. Deeds - Mr. Deeds, sir - you really must get up. It's late!
LONGFELLOW: ( without budging - without opening his eyes )
WALTER: Yes, sir.
LONGFELLOW: I just wanted to make sure.
WALTER: If you'll permit me to say so, sir, you were out on quite a bender last night, sir.
LONGFELLOW: Bender? You're wrong, Walter. We started out to a binge but we never got to it.
WALTER: ( humoring him )
LONGFELLOW: What's that?
WALTER: A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
LONGFELLOW: ( slow to comprehend anything )
WALTER: Yes, sir. It makes the head feel smaller.
LONGFELLOW: ( his face finally reacting )
WALTER: Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
LONGFELLOW: She was a lady in distress. She wouldn't let me help her. Got a lot of pride. I like that.
WALTER: Oh, I do too, sir.
LONGFELLOW: I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last I'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.
WALTER: I'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.
LONGFELLOW: What do you mean? I remember everything! Hand me my pants - I wrote her phone number on a piece of paper.
WALTER: You have no pants, sir.
WALTER: You came home last night - without them.
LONGFELLOW: ( after a double take )
WALTER: As a matter of fact, you came home without any clothes. You were in your - uh - shorts. Yes, sir.
LONGFELLOW: Oh, don't be silly, Walter. I couldn't walk around in the streets without any clothes. I'd be arrested.
WALTER: That's what the two policemén said, ? 385 ? What two policemen?
LONGFELLOW: What two policemen?
WALTER: The ones who brought you home, sir. They said you and another gentleman kept walking up and down the streets, shouting: "Back to nature! Clothes are a blight on civilization! Back to nature!"
LONGFELLOW: Listen, Walter, if a man named Morrow calls up, tell him I'm not in. He may be a great author, but I think he's crazy. The man's crazy, Walter.
WALTER: Yes, sir. By the way, did you
LONGFELLOW: ( pointing )
WALTER: But how'll I put on the slipper, sir?
WALTER: ( continuing )
LONGFELLOW: Looking for?
WALTER: You kept searching me last night, sir. Going through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington.
LONGFELLOW: ( flatly )
WALTER: Very good, sir.
COBB: ( wildly )
LONGFELLOW: ( holding out telegram )
COBB: Arthur! Who's Arthur?
LONGFELLOW: He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
COBB: ( he goes crazy )
COBB: ( while Longfellow reads )
LONGFELLOW: Oh, they insisted on following me.
COBB: ( wildly )
LONGFELLOW: ( glances up )
COBB: Are those stories true?
LONGFELLOW: I don't remember. "Cinderella Man!" What do they mean by that?
COBB: They'd call you anything if you gave them half a chance. They've got you down as a sap.
LONGFELLOW: ( calmly )
COBB: ( quickly )
LONGFELLOW: Sometimes it's the only solution.
COBB: Not editors. Take my word for it. Not If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to
LONGFELLOW: If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to
COBB: ( bends over, earnestly )
LONGFELLOW: ( referring to paper )
COBB: That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?
LONGFELLOW: Yes, I guess I'll have to.
COBB: ( mopping his brow )
LONGFELLOW: Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.
BUTLER: ( entering )
LONGFELLOW: ( alertly )
BUTLER: Yes, sir.
LONGFELLOW: Fine. I'll talk to her. Give me the phone, quick. She's the only one I'm going to talk to from now on.
LONGFELLOW: It's awfully nice of you to show me around like this.
BABE: I enjoy it.
LONGFELLOW: The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do.
BABE: Well, I'd like to - but I have a job to think of.
BOB: ( to driver )
DRIVER'S VOICE: Keep your shirt on!
BOB: It don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight.
FRANK: Babe ought to get him drunk again.
BABE: Got any news
LONGFELLOW: Sure. I met you.
BABE: ( laughs )
LONGFELLOW: Oh, that - well, we had another meeting. I told them I'd go on being Chairman ( explaining )
BABE: Yes, I know.
LONGFELLOW: I told 'em I'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
BABE: What did they say?
LONGFELLOW: Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
BABE: What did they say?
LONGFELLOW: Huh? Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store.
BABE: What are they going to do?
LONGFELLOW: ( leans over close to her )
FIRST GIRL: Isn't it a scream - "Cinderella Man!" The dope!
2ND GIRL: I'd like to get my hooks into that guy.
FIRST GIRL: Don't worry. Somebody's probably taking him for plenty.
LONGFELLOW: ( quietly )
LONGFELLOW: Have you seen the papers?
BABE: That's what I like about you. You think about a man's feelings. I'd like to go down to that newspaper and punch the fellow in the nose that's writing that stuff
LONGFELLOW: That's what I like about you. You think about a man's feelings. I'd like to go down to that newspaper and punch the fellow in the nose that's writing that stuff

BABE: Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out.
LONGFELLOW: Yeah, let's.
BABE: Yeah, let's.
DRIVER: Hey, wise guys. He's getting off.
BABE: He stands across the street from Grant's Tomb, looking solemn. His eyes moist. She is unaware of his emotion.
BABE: Come on, don't you want to see it?
FRANK: Feast your eyes. Grant's Tomb!
BOB: Is that it?
BABE: As they approach the monument.
BABE: There you are. Grant's Tomb. I hope you're not disappointed.
LONGFELLOW: ( throatily )
BABE: To most people, it's an awful letdown.
LONGFELLOW: ( in awe )
BABE: I say, to most people it's a washout.
LONGFELLOW: That depends on what they see.
BABE: ( looks up at him )
LONGFELLOW: Me? Oh, I see a small Ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier. I see thousands of marching men. I see General Lee with a broken heart, surrendering, and I can see the beginning of a new nation, like Abraham Lincoln said. And I can see that Ohio boy being inaugurated as President
LONGFELLOW: ( overcome - he almost chokes on his final words )
SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR: Sorry, Mr. Hopper. Mr. Cedar won't answer his phone. Sorry.
OFFICE CLERK: ( passing by )
SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR: Search me. The three 'Cs' and little 'B' have been in there for over an hour.
BUDINGTON: I don't want to be critical, John, but here it is
CEDAR: ( pouncing on him )
BUDINGTON: Yes, but you said
CEDAR: ( walking way from him )
FIRST BROTHER: It's ridiculous for us to have to worry about a boy like that.
BUDINGTON: Exactly what I was saying to my wife when this
FIRST BROTHER: Who cares what you were saying to your ? 393 ? There is a moment's awkward silence. The silence is broken by the buzzing of the dictograph. Cedar crosses to it and snaps the button.
CEDAR: SECRETARY'S VOICE Mr. and Mrs. Semple are still waiting.
SECRETARY'S VOICE: Mr. and Mrs. Semple are still waiting.
CEDAR: ( irritated )
FIRST BROTHER: Those people have been in to see me every day this week.
2ND BROTHER: Who are they ?
CEDAR: ( dismissing it )
FIRST BROTHER: They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
CEDAR: Nuisance value?
FIRST BROTHER: They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
CEDAR: ( suddenly )
MRS. SEMPLE: We've been trying to
SEMPLES: ( smoothly cutting her off )
CEDAR: ( smoothly cutting her off )
MR. SEMPLE: Semple takes the cigar - rather flabbergasted at all the sudden attention showered upon him.
BABE: There's Times Square.
LONGFELLOW: You can almost spit on it, can't you?
BABE: Why don't you try?
BABE: ( as she wipes )
BABE: You're worried about those articles they're writing about you, aren't you?
LONGFELLOW: I'm not worrying any more. I suppose they'll go on writing them till they get tired. You don't believe all that stuff, do you?
BABE: Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.
LONGFELLOW: Yeah, I guess so. What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. Why don't they try liking each other once in a An awkward pause.

LONGFELLOW: What's that?

BABE: You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
LONGFELLOW'S VOICE: I haven't.
BABE: Why not?
LONGFELLOW: Oh, I don't know.
BABE: You must have met a lot of swell society girls since you've been here. Don't you like them?
LONGFELLOW: I haven't met anybody here that I like, particularly. They all seem to have the St. Vitus Dance.[12]
LONGFELLOW: I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.
BABE: I'm from a small town too, you know.
LONGFELLOW: ( interested )
BABE: Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
LONGFELLOW: ( finding a kindred soul )
BABE: Ah, it's a beautiful little town, too. A row of poplar trees right along Main Street. Always smelled as if it just had a bath.
BABE: I've often thought about going back.
LONGFELLOW: You have?
BABE: Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: "No matter what happens, honey, don't He sounds like a person worth while There is a pause while Longfellow watches her, and she is lost in thought.

LONGFELLOW: He did?
BABE: Yes. I can do "Swanee River." Would you like to hear me?
LONGFELLOW: ( enthusiastically )
BABE: Oh, I suppose you could do better.
LONGFELLOW: Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
BABE: "Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
LONGFELLOW: Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do "Humoresque" with you.
BABE: It had better be good.
BOB: I wonder if they'd want to make it a 149. MEDIUM SHOT Longfellow and Babe. They are having a grand time with their singing.

BABE: Here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh. To us he looks like a freak. You know what he told me tonight? He said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms.
MABEL: The guy's balmy.
BABE: Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.
MABEL: Aw, cut it out, will you? You'll get me thinking about Charlie again.
BABE: He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?

LONGFELLOW: A man ought to know where he fits in. I just don't fit in around here. I once had an idea I could do something with the money, but they kept me so busy here, I haven't had time to figure it out. I guess I'll wait till I get back There is a long pause. Both lost in their own thoughts.

BABE: No, I don't mind.
LONGFELLOW: All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
BABE: A girl?

SEMPLE: ( to Cedar )
COBB: ( full of excitement )
BAILIFF: Quiet, please! The Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, is now in session, the Honorable John May, Judge, presiding. Be seated.
JUDGE: The court wishes to warn those present that it will tolerate no disturbances.
JUDGE: I understand that you have no counsel, Mr. Deeds. In fact, that you have no intention of defending any of these charges. Now, if you wish to change your mind, the hearing can be postponed.
JUDGE: DISSOLVE TO: INT. COURTROOM 268. MEDIUM SHOT Cedar is on his feet.
CEDAR: ( addressing the court )
CEDAR'S VOICE: I have before me a series of articles written by a newspaper woman who was an eye-witness to his conduct ever since he came to New York.
CEDAR: She tells how, in the midst of a normal conversation, he would suddenly begin playing his tuba. She tells of his attacks upon several of our eminent writers - for no apparent reason. In fact, there are many instances not recorded in these articles in which Mr. Deeds satisfied an unnatural desire to smash people up without provocation.
CEDAR: I, myself, unable to keep pace with his mental quirks, and constantly fearful of assault, turned down an opportunity to represent him as his attorney. This newspaper woman, whom we have subpoenaed to testify, tells how he tied up traffic for an hour feeding doughnuts to a poor horse. And by his own statement, waiting for that horse to ask for a cup of coffee.
CEDAR: We have photographs to substantiate this little episode, and other photographs showing Mr. Deeds jumping upon a fire engine. This scarcely sounds like the action of a man in whom the disposition of twenty million dollars may safely be entrusted. This writer of these articles - a woman whose intelligence and integrity in the newspaper world is unquestioned - held him in such contempt that she quite aptly named him "The Cinderella 271. CLOSEUP - LONGFELLOW CEDAR'S VOICE We have witnesses here from Mandrake Falls, his own home town, who will tell of his conduct throughout his lifetime, proving that his derangement is neither recent nor a temporary one.
CEDAR'S VOICE: We have witnesses here from Mandrake Falls, his own home town, who will tell of his conduct throughout his lifetime, proving that his derangement is neither recent nor a temporary one.
CEDAR: We have others who will tell of his unusual behavior when he invited the great leaders of the musical world to his home, and then proceeded to forcibly eject them. Only recently when he was in the County Hospital for observation, he not only refused to be examined by these gentlemen, the state psychiatrists, but he actually made a violent attack upon them.
CEDAR: In these times, with the country incapacitated by economic ailments, and endangered with an undercurrent of social unrest, the promulgation of such a weird, fantastic and impractical plan as contemplated by the defendant, is capable of fomenting a disturbance from which the country may not soon recover. It is our duty to stop it! Our government is fully aware of its difficulties and can pull itself out of its economic rut without the assistance of Mr. Deeds, or any other crackpot.
CEDAR'S VOICE: His attempted action must therefore be attributed to a diseased mind afflicted with hallucinations of grandeur, and obsessed with an insane desire to become a public benefactor.

CEDAR: Now Dr. Von Holler, will you kindly tell the court what your opinion is on this case?
VON HOLLER: This is purely a case of manic depression. In cases of this kind, patients sometimes go on for years before being detected.
VON HOLLER: You remember, Dr. Fosdick, in my last book there are some very fine examples.
DR. FOSDICK: ( nodding )
VON HOLLER: Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?

BABE: You can't do it! You've got to make him talk.
CEDAR'S VOICE: Your Honor, I object!

JUDGE: Very well. Take the stand.
BABE: Oh, thank you!
CEDAR: ( shouting )
JUDGE: Let her speak.
BABE: I know why he won't defend himself! That has a bearing on the case, hasn't it? He's been hurt! He's been hurt by everybody's he met since he came here, principally by me. He's been the victim of every conniving crook in town. The newspapers pounced on him - made him a target for their feeble humor.
BABE: I was smarter than the rest of them! I got closer to him so I could laugh louder. Why shouldn't he keep quiet? Every time he said anything it was twisted around to sound imbecilic.
BABE: He can thank me for it! I handed the gang a grand laugh. This is a fitting climax to my sense of humor.
CEDAR: But Your Honor - this is preposterous!
BABE: Certainly I wrote those articles. I was going to get a raise - and a month's vacation! But I stopped writing them when I found out what he was all about! When I realized how real he was.
BABE'S VOICE: He could never fit in with our distorted viewpoint because he's honest and sincere - and good. If that man is crazy, Your Honor, the rest of us belong in straight-jackets.
CEDAR: Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman's obviously in love with him.

CEDAR: Your Honor, her testimony is of no value. Why shouldn't she defend him? It's a tribute to American womanhood - the instinct to protect the weak. I'm not saying that nobody likes the boy. I cherish a fond affection for him myself. But that doesn't mean to say
MAC: When the windbag here gets through, Your Honor, I'd like to verify what Miss Bennett said. I'm her editor. When she quit her job, she told me what a swell fellow this man was. And anything Babe Bennett says is okay with me.

If a man's crazy just 'cause he plays the tuba, then somebody better look into it, 'cause there are a lot of tuba players running around loose. Of course, I don't see any harm in it. I play mine whenever I want to concentrate. That may sound funny to some people - but everybody does something silly when they're thinking. For instance, the Judge here is an O-filler . . .
JUDGE: A what?
LONGFELLOW: An O-filler. You fill in all the spaces in the O's, with your pencil.
LONGFELLOW'S VOICE: That may make you look a little crazy, Your Honor, just sitting around filling in O's - but I don't see anything wrong 'cause that helps you to think. Other people are doodlers.
JUDGE: ? 456 ? 332. MED. SHOT - FRONT OF COURTROOM That's a name we made up back home for people who make foolish designs on paper when they're thinking. It's called doodling. Almost everybody's a doodler. Did you ever see a scratch pad in a telephone booth? People draw the most idiotic pictures when they're thinking. Dr. Von Holler, here, could probably think up a long name for it, because he doodles all the time.

LONGFELLOW: ( to Dr. Von Holler )
LONGFELLOW: Exhibit A - for the defense.
LONGFELLOW'S VOICE: And the lady next to him is a knuckle-cracker.
LONGFELLOW: So you see, everybody does silly things to help them think.
MAC: Nice work, toots!
JUDGE: Mr. Deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home?
LONGFELLOW: Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi told the truth. I did throw them out because I didn't want the party in the first place. I didn't invite anybody. Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just came to see what kind of a freak the "Cinderella Man" was. I don't know how people like that are supposed to act, Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman is an example, I'll stick to simple folks. She just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything. If I were a friend of hers, I'd have her examined.
CEDAR: Your Honor, this is becoming farcical. I demand that Mr. Deeds dispense with side remarks and confine himself to facts! Let him explain his wanderings around the streets in underclothes, his feeding doughnuts to horses!
JUDGE'S VOICE: Mr. Cedar's right. Those things do look kind of bad, don't they? But to tell the truth, Your Honor, I don't remember them. I guess they happened, all right, because I don't think a policeman would lie about a thing like that, but I was drunk. It was the first time I was ever drunk in my life. It's probably happened to you, some time. I mean, when you were younger, of course.
LONGFELLOW: Mr. Cedar's right. Those things do look kind of bad, don't they? But to tell the truth, Your Honor, I don't remember them. I guess they happened, all right, because I don't think a policeman would lie about a thing like that, but I was drunk. It was the first time I was ever drunk in my life. It's probably happened to you, some time. I mean, when you were younger, of course.
LONGFELLOW: It's likely to happen to anybody. Just the other morning I read in the paper about Mr. Cedar's own son - about how he got drunk and insisted on driving a taxi-cab, while the driver sat inside. Isn't that so, Mr. Cedar? Isn't that so , Mr. Cedar?
CEDAR: Your Honor, I object.
JUDGE: 346. MEDIUM SHOT Now about the Falkner sisters. That's kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar going all the way to Mandrake Falls to bring them here. Do you mind if I talk to them?
LONGFELLOW: Now about the Falkner sisters. That's kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar going all the way to Mandrake Falls to bring them here. Do you mind if I talk to them?
JUDGE: Not at all.
LONGFELLOW: Jane, who owns the house you live in?
JANE: Why, you own it, Longfellow.
AMY: Yes, you own it.
LONGFELLOW'S VOICE: Do you pay any rent?
JANE: ( after conferring with Amy )
AMY: Good heavens, no! We never pay rent.
LONGFELLOW: Are you happy there?
JANE: Oh, yes.
AMY: Yes, indeed.
LONGFELLOW: Now, Jane, a little while ago you said I was pixilated. Do you still think ( after the usual conference )
JANE: ( after the usual conference )
AMY: ( smiling )
LONGFELLOW: ( smiling )
JANE: Why, everybody in Mandrake Falls in pixilated - except us.
AMY: 349. MED. SHOT OF SPECTATORS There is an outburst of laughter which the Judge quickly quells with his gavel.
LONGFELLOW: Now, just one more question. Do you see the Judge here? He's a nice man, isn't he?
LONGFELLOW: Do you think he's pixilated?
JANE: ( quickly )
AMY: Yes, indeedy.
JUDGE: Mr. Deeds, you haven't yet touched upon a most important thing. This rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. It is, to say the least, most uncommon.
LONGFELLOW: Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your CAMERA MOVES TO CLOSER SHOT, featuring Longfellow and Judge, as former continues:
LONGFELLOW: Suppose you were living in a small town and getting along fine, and suddenly somebody dropped $20,000,000 in your lap. Supposing you discovered that all that money was messing up your life, was bringing a lot of vultures around your neck, and making you lose faith in everybody. You'd be a little worried, wouldn't you? You'd feel that you had a hot potato in your hand, and you'd want to drop it. I guess Dr. Von Holler would say you were riding on
CEDAR: ( shouting )
JUDGE: Please, Mr. Cedar!
LONGFELLOW: Personally, I don't know what Mr. Cedar's raving about. From what I can see, no matter what system of government we have, there will always be leaders and always be followers.
LONGFELLOW'S VOICE: It's like the road out in front of my house. It's on a steep hill. Every day I watch the cars climbing up. Some go lickety-split up that hill on high
LONGFELLOW: some have to shift into second - and some sputter and shake and slip back to the bottom again. Same cars - same gasoline - yet some make it and some don't. And I say the fellows who can make the hill on high should stop once in a while and help those who can't.
LONGFELLOW: ( making his point )
LONGFELLOW: ( hotly )
LONGFELLOW: See all those fellows? They're the ones I'm trying to help. They need it!
LONGFELLOW: Now, my plan is very simple. I was going to give each family ten acres - a horse, a cow and some seed. And if they work the farm for three years, it's theirs. Now, if that's crazy, maybe I ought to be sent to an institution. But I don't think it is. And what's more, Mr. Cedar doesn't either.
CEDAR: It's a lie!
JUDGE: Mr. Cedar!
CEDAR: Mr. Deeds is drawing on his warped imagination!
CEDAR'S VOICE: I've never heard anything so colossally stupid in my life!
CEDAR: It's an insult to our intelligence to sit here and listen to his childish ? 463 ? Throughout his speech the Judge has been pounding his gavel. Longfellow has his eyes levelled off on Cedar.
JUDGE: ( when quiet reigns )
CEDAR: But Your Honor
JUDGE: Mr. Cedar!
JUDGE: Anything else, Mr. Deeds?
LONGFELLOW: ( eyes still on Cedar )
JUDGE: Thank you, Your Honor.
LONGFELLOW: Thank you, Your Honor.
BAILIFF'S VOICE: Order! Order! Order in the court!
BAILIFF'S VOICE: Remain seated and come to order. The Court is again in session.
JUDGE: Before the Court announces its decision, I want to warn all who are here that the police have orders to arrest anyone creating a disturbance.
JUDGE: ( serious mien )
JUDGE: But in the opinion of the Court, you are not only sane, but you are the sanest man that ever walked into this courtroom. Case dismissed!
MRS. SEMPLE: You nose-twitcher!
BUDINGTON: Oh, I knew it! I knew it! You, you
JANE: He's still pixilated.
AMY: He sure is.
THE END: Writers : Clarence Budington Kelland Robert Riskin
