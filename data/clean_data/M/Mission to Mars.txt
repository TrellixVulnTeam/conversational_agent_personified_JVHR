WILLIS: I guess what I'm trying to say is, since this is my last night on Earth, it's gonna be a very precious memory to me. Y'know?
PRETTY GIRL: Nice try, Nick.
KIROV: Hey, Woody, our Mars One crew won't be heading back to Earth till ten days after you guys land at our base camp with Mars Two. That's a pretty good long rendezvous.
WOODY: What are you suggesting, Sergei?
KIROV: Maybe you should bring a baseball bat. Yes? American baseball? Our two crews could have ourselves a little Solar System Series.
WOODY: Please. Half you guys are foreigners. We'd crush you.
KIROV: No, no, we have equal crews. Three men, one woman. Same handicap.
WOODY: Easy now, you're talking about my And Terri just happens to be one helluva shortstop.
TERRI: Fast pitch, no steals, batter calls his own strikes. Thousand bucks make it interesting?
COTE: Eh bien. Winner take all.
TERRI: ( smiles sweetly at Kirov ) Bring some balls. You wanna know the sad part? Technically I outrank her. But if we want any peace at all on Mars Two, I'm gonna be saying a lot of "Yes,
WOODY: You wanna know the sad part? Technically I outrank her. But if we want any peace at all on Mars Two, I'm gonna be saying a lot of "Yes,
1ST WIFE: .just not sure how I feel about NASA allowing couples to go on this type of mission together.
1ST WIFE: ( embarrassed ) Nothing personal, Terri. It's just that, well, it's kind of a funny feeling for those of us staying ( carefully neutral ) All the research shows that marriage will provide stability on these long duration trips.
TERRI: ( carefully neutral ) All the research shows that marriage will provide stability on these long duration trips.
2ND WIFE: Then they haven't studied some of the couples I've known.
3RD WIFE: Anybody seen Jim McConnell?
4TH WIFE: I don't think he's coming.
1ST WIFE: God, that poor man. How's he doing?
2ND WIFE: Totally losing it, from what I hear. Can't sleep, can't eat. Visits her grave almost every day. They say he could lose mission status.
3RD WIFE: Oh, that's so sad. That is just so tragic. You go to a routine physical one day, and wham.
4TH WIFE: After all those years of training, too. It was their whole dream.
1ST WIFE: Must be a pretty funny feeling for Luke Graham. Y'know? Now he's gonna be in the history books. First man on Mars.
DEBRA: He's not coming, Luke.
LUKE: Jim deserves this, too. All his friends are here. And it's my last Your last night with us, too.
DEBRA: ( gently ) Your last night with us, too.
LUKE: I love you, Deb.
DEBRA: I love you too, baby. But maybe you should spend some time with Bobby.
LUKE: Yeah. I will. Where is he?
DEBRA: Up in his fort.
WILLIS: Deep space is so lonesome. So cold. But I guess I'll have my memories to keep me warm.
BOBBY: Who's gonna read to me now, at
LUKE: Mommy will.
BOBBY: I like when you do it. Now we're never gonna finish our book.
LUKE: Well, I'll tell you what. I've been thinking about that. And what I thought was how 'bout if I bring along my own copy? Then every night, wherever I am, I'll read a little bit more of it. And I'll know that you and Mommy, wherever you are, you're reading it too. That way, it'll feel like we're still reading it together. 'Cause I don't know about you, but I'm pretty anxious to find out how 'ol Ben Gunn got marooned on that island. What d'you say?
LUKE: Good deal. Can I have a hug?
DEBRA: We were afraid you wouldn't come.
MCCONNELL: I caught a whiff of your barbecue. After that I was helpless.
DEBRA: All the way out in Galveston?
MCCONNELL: Something like that. It's his night, Deb. I didn't want to spoil it.
DEBRA: Spoil it? He's been going crazy looking for you.
LUKE: C'mon. A whole lot of folks here are gonna be mighty glad to see you.
WOODY: ( abruptly ) I wish we were all going. Together.
LUKE: Then you've got a short memory. Think back to how we were by the second week of lunar training.
WOODY: Oh, you're not gonna bring that up I'm trying to remember, let's see, which one of us scored the lowest ranking up there?
LUKE: ( laughing ) I'm trying to remember, let's see, which one of us scored the lowest ranking up there?
WOODY: You just can't let that go
LUKE: Oh, man, three commanders, on the same ship? If they sent us off to Mars together, there wouldn't be enough fuel to lift all those egos.
WOODY: ( laughs ) Bullshit, we would've made a great That was never gonna happen. I was always teamed with Maggie, and we were mostly chalkboard jockies. You know? Systems. Payloads.
MCCONNELL: That was never gonna happen. I was always teamed with Maggie, and we were mostly chalkboard jockies. You know? Systems. Payloads.
LUKE: Listen to him. Mr. Cover-of-Time Yeah, who landed the crippled Block II Shuttle?
WOODY: Yeah, who landed the crippled Block II Shuttle?
LUKE: Yeah, and who scored highest on the lunar rankings?
WOODY: Let it go, Luke.
MCCONNELL: ( smiles ) Sure, I made a little noise. But putting the first footprints on Mars? Nah. That's for guys who. ( looks at Luke ) .wrote their Ph.D. thesis on how to colonize the place. And guys who. ( looks at Woody ) .read too much science fiction as a kid and still wear little Flash Gordon rocketships around their necks.
WOODY: You read the same damn science fiction books that I did! You're just not man enough to wear jewelry!
WOODY: You want Flash. You know you want him. Well you'll have to come through
MCCONNELL: God, she would've loved to see you two clowns. Just one more time.
LUKE: Hey, Woodrow, isn't it about time you donated this thing to a museum?
WOODY: Internal combustion, boys. Accept no
WOODY: Jim, if there's ever. if there's anything Terri and I can do
MCCONNELL: I'm okay. Really. Thanks.
WOODY: See you when I get to Mars, Luke. Don't solve all the mysteries of the universe, okay? Leave a little something for the next guys.
LUKE: I'll see what I can do. Just make sure you bring some fresh beer.
WOODY: You got it.
LUKE: Should've been your mission, Jim. Yours and Maggie's.
LUKE: None of us ever wanted Mars the way you two did. Not even Woody. Twelve years of hoping for this assignment, training for it
MCCONNELL: That's all over now.
LUKE: If Maggie hadn't gotten sick if you hadn't pulled yourself out of the rotation to take care of her
LUKE: No, I'm gonna say this. I have to say it. I wanted Mars One. Hell, I battled you for it every step of the way. Never wanted to beat anybody so bad in my life. But not like this. Jim, I'd give this all up in a second, if it would bring Maggie back to us.
MCCONNELL: I know that, Luke. You don't have to say it. Mars is yours now. Go get Take care of yourself.
LUKE: ( pause ) Take care of yourself.
MCCONNELL: Yeah. You too.
HIS SHOES: And the sandy verge of the front yard.
MCCONNELL'S EYES: Are a map of complex emotions: regret, injured pride, infinite yearning. Gently, a bit self-consciously, HE LIFTS ONE SHOE And sets it down again, making a careful, deliberate footprint in the sandy soil.

LUKE: Yeah, Renee.
COTE: Luke, I just got ARES-8 on line and. Well, we think you're gonna wanna see this for yourself.
LUKE: Copy that.
OMITTED: Sequence omitted from original script.
VIDEO SCREEN: We see a low-angle image of an elongated, rubble and dirt- covered MOUNTAIN. Hard to tell scale, but it looks huge. What's most striking, however, is a WHITE PEAK barely protruding through the rubble two-thirds of the way along the mountain's ridgeline. Its whiteness is in clear contrast to the typical rust-orange of the surrounding rubble; what's more, this strange little peak also displays an oddly-smooth, multi-planed symmetry.
LUKE: What the hell is that?
COTE: No idea, boss.
LUKE: Where is it?
WILLIS: You don't wanna know.
LUKE: C'mon, what's so funny? Gimme the
COTE: Latitude 41 degrees north, longitude 9 degrees west.
LUKE: The Plains of Cydonia. So? Oh no. You're not telling me
COTE: Oui. Exactement! It's Kirov's fault, he picked today's sector.
KIROV: Hey, c'mon! We've got a scientific duty to check that thing out.
LUKE: Great. That's great. The first anomaly we hit, and it's gotta be in the one place guaranteed to make NASA look ridiculous. You know how many books have been written about that damned The Egyptians put it there.
COTE: The Egyptians put it there.
KIROV: No, the Amazons.
WILLIS: No, it was little green men!
LUKE: And all because a couple of lousy impact craters happen to look like eye sockets. If this gets out, we'll have every UFO kook on Earth spouting off on the six o'clock news. C'mon, people, gimme a read here. Is that a cinder cone?
KIROV: Nah, too smooth. Too angular. Volcanic No fissures. No caldera.
COTE: No fissures. No caldera.
LUKE: It's an upwelling, for sure. But maybe not volcanic.
LUKE: Look at the color. And see how shiny it is? I could swear that's ice.
COTE: This far south?
WILLIS: Impossible. You can't have ice at this latitude. Not unless.
WILLIS: Oh my God.
LUKE: How far away is it?
KIROV: Sixteen kilometers northeast. Take us twenty minutes to get there.
LUKE: ( considers a moment ) Let's send a packet to Micker. Then we'll go check it out.
AIRLOCK DOORS: Slide back, REVEALING the crew in EVA suits, carrying gear. They walk over to.
LUKE: This is a truly anomalous formation. Looks like nothing we've seen so far. The structure appears to be crystalline, at least from the angle displayed by ARES-8 .
LUKE: ( grins ) We're all trying not to go too nuts up here, but we think there's a good chance this could be an extrusion from some subsurface, geothermal column of water. And if we're right.
LUKE: .then we've found the key to permanent human colonization.
MCCONNELL: Sits at the center console, wearing a headset. He's now the Mars One CAPCOM ( Capsule Communicator ), and his manner is brisk, efficient, all-business. A TECHNICIAN leans in for The technician nods, hurries away. McConnell, sharing the intense excitement of those around him, stares up at
MCCONNELL: Tell geology and hydrology we need to scramble on this. Full-court press.
THE SCREEN: Where Luke and his crew are still smiling, well knowing the excitement their bombshell will create.
LUKE: Anyway, we'are going out to take a closer look at it, try to get an idea of its composition. By the time you receive this, we should be just about on-site.
KIROV: Jesus Christ.
THE ASTRONAUTS: Walk towards the mountain. There's a very deep, very low, staccato tone intruding over their headsets.
LUKE: Anyone else hear that?
COTE: Yeah. What is it?
WILLIS: Sounds like our antenna's out of Can you fix it?
LUKE: Can you fix it?
WILLIS: Hey, skip, I can fix anything.
LUKE: Big talker. Renee, Sergei, let's break out the radar, see what this thing's made of.
BECK: .and this is the Mars Mission Control Room, nicknamed "Micker." I understand a comm packet is incoming from Mars One Base Camp, so you may find this interesting.
AMBASSADOR: That man over there. He's in charge?
MCCONNELL: Who is surrounded by a KNOT OF TECHNICIANS, to whom he is giving quiet, precise instructions. They hover, then depart, like so many eager bees.
BECK: Smiles indulgently at the ambassador's misunderstanding.
BECK: No, actually, that's Jim McConnell, the CAPCOM. Our voice link to the astronauts? Jim's been with the manned Mars program since its inception. One of our real pioneers.
AMBASSADOR: Will he be going to Mars, too?
BECK: Ah, no. This is as close as he gets.
LUKE: .anyway, that's about it. We'll send another packet when we get back.
LUKE: Oh, right. One more thing. Today is a very special day for a good friend of ours, and I know he's there right
LUKE: Now, he hates it when any fuss is made, so I won't mention his name.
LUKE: .because the last thing in the world I'd ever want to do is embarrass someone like Jim McConnell.
LUKE: C'mon, you Micker weasels, sing!
LUKE: ( sings a line, then, to CAMERA: ) Hey, Ray! Take a look at him! Is he all red with one of those fake "I'm- a-good-sport" grins?
LUKE: And hey, you guys, check out Ray! Does he have on one of his "This- wasn't-in-my-mission-plan" faces?
LUKE: Nothing you can do about it, Ray! We're a hundred million miles away!
LUKE: Happy Birthday, Jimbo! Make a wish!
LUKE: Catch you again soon. Take care, buddy. End of transmission.
LUKE: Well? What's under there?
COTE: ( puzzled ) Je ne sais pas. I. I think there's something wrong with the equipment.
LUKE: I mean, it can't be right. It says. it says there's metal under there. There's ten, twelve meters of rubble and sand, and then. solid metal.
COTE: I mean, it can't be right. It says. it says there's metal under there. There's ten, twelve meters of rubble and sand, and then. solid metal.
COTE: ( points ) There's ten, twelve meters of rubble and sand, and then. solid metal.
LUKE: That doesn't make any sense. You're reading a vein of ore.
COTE: ( shakes her head ) No. It's under the whole mountain.
LUKE: Nick, could the problem with the antenna be interfering?
WILLIS: Could be.
LUKE: ( to Cote and Kirov ) Try it closer and up the power. I'll watch the screen.
MCCONNELL: Ah, we're all pretty stoked about that formation you spotted, Mars One. The folks in the geology and hydrology back rooms are going over your images and comparing them to every photomap they've got.
LUKE: Nick, how we coming on that antenna?
WILLIS: Goin' as fast as I can, boss.
KIROV: Hey, Nick. Come show me how stupid I am. I can't get this to work.
MCCONNELL: Medical wants me to remind you that you're three days late on your blood tests. I know they're a bore, but you've got to get them done, or else. or else I don't know what. Just do them, okay?
KIROV: All set here, chief.
LUKE: Okay. Crank up the juice and let's see what's in this sucker.
MCCONNELL: I think that's about it for business. But on a personal note, be advised that, ah, none of you can sing worth a damn.
KIROV: Flips a switch on the radar gun, then swivels its muzzle slowly across the near slope of the mountain. We hear and feel the radar signal. The immediate result is that the pulsing tone we've been hearing suddenly stops.
LUKE: Looks up from the display screen. A puzzled expression.
LUKE: Why did that stop?
THE ASTRONAUTS: Exchange amazed glances. Can't believe their eyes.
MCCONNELL: Honestly, Luke, if you guys don't have anything better to do with your time, I can make some suggestions to mission medical. There are worse things than blood tests.
KIROV: Snatched up by the wind, then swept past him, in a terrifying blur, arms and legs flailing, mouth open in a silent scream as he vanishes.
WIDE ANGLE: On the plain, as the last pebbles, released from suction, pitter down, bouncing. Swirls of dust and sand drift away, settling gently. The harsh orange landscape is once again calm, peaceful. And then, from the direction of the nearby mountain, we hear another sound: the deep bass pulsing rumble returns.
MCCONNELL: Oh, and I talked to Debra. She and Bobby are doing fine. Said to tell you, they're, ah, they're on their "third time through the book, page page 125." They send their love and say take care of yourself. Same from us here, buddy. Till next time, then. End of transmission.
WOODY: ( reads ) "Problem: Hatch door malfunction, backup power fail, manual override fail. Solution: Replace circuit breaker 907B."
WOODY: Okay. Piece of cake. God, who dreams up these nightmares?
WOODY: God, who dreams up these nightmares?
TERRI: Don't try to change the subject.
WOODY: I'm not! We're talking about your sister's wedding, right?
TERRI: Very funny. We're talking about dancing lessons. Before my sister's Honey, do you mind? I've got a catastrophic power failure here.
WOODY: Honey, do you mind? I've got a catastrophic power failure here.
TERRI: Woody, we're a married couple. Would it kill you to invite me out on the floor once in awhile?
WOODY: I danced with you at our wedding.
TERRI: I'm not talking about shuffling your feet around while you grab my butt. I mean real dancing. Cha-cha, rhumba, Face it, honey, some couples dance, some go to Mars. That's life.
WOODY: Face it, honey, some couples dance, some go to Mars. That's life.
TERRI: I'm serious. We've got two more months in this training rotation, but just as soon as we get home, we're starting lessons. If we never dance, people will think there's something wrong.
WOODY: If they see me dance, they'll know there's something wrong.
TERRI: You are such a lug.
PHIL'S VOICE: Cockpit, this is Control.
TERRI: Control, this is Cockpit.
PHIL'S VOICE: Uh, Terri, they want us all back in the Station. Report to Micker.
TERRI: Who says report to Micker?
PHIL'S VOICE: The little men who live in my head.
WOODY: Phil, c'mon! We just started this Woody, it was Ray Beck. He told me to round up the team. Now.
PHIL: Woody, it was Ray Beck. He told me to round up the team. Now.
OMITTED: Sequence omitted from original script.
BECK: Then, at 1417, the X-band continuous data stream from Mars went silent. All data med, environmental, everything suddenly stopped. While we were trying to figure out what the hell went wrong, we got a signal from the folks at the Large Array at At the same moment we lost the data stream, they picked up an intense burst of energy from Mars.
MCCONNELL: At the same moment we lost the data stream, they picked up an intense burst of energy from Mars.
WOODY: What do you mean, "intense"?
MCCONNELL: ( hesitates )
TERRI: What about the crew?
BECK: The level of energy in the pulse. didn't seem survivable.
WOODY: What about the REMO? It went into Mars orbit last week. Maybe that could give us some clue.
MCCONNELL: Good thinking, Woody. That's just what we tried next.
MCCONNELL: The Resupply Module checked out fine. No instrument failures, no change in status. Orbit holding steady. But there was something else. The REMO'S computer contained an uplink message a very faint, highly distorted transmission from Mars One Base Camp.
TERRI: Someone's alive.
MCCONNELL: The message is almost indecipherable. Two teams are still working on it. You better see for yourselves.
PHIL: The message is almost indecipherable. Two teams are still working on it. You better see for yourselves.
BECK: The message is almost indecipherable. Two teams are still working on it. You better see for yourselves.
TECHNICIAN: Still concentrating on the audio. We managed to bring out a couple more words, but we've got a long way to Show us whatever you've got.
WOODY: Show us whatever you've got.
LUKE: .make this quick. may be only ch .to the site, when we. hit us just as we. thers are all dead.
LUKE: ( following more static ) .low sound that we couldn't understand. Then all of a sudden there was this terrib. ( another long burst of static ) .stems are holding up for now, but I don't know how long I can.
TECHNICIAN: That's it.
PHIL'S EYES: He looks back at her, haunted.
TERRI: What did Luke mean by a "low sound?"
BECK: If this was a earthquake, as we're now assuming, there's usually an auditory component.
WOODY: But that energy pulse they picked up in New Mexico.
PHIL: Electromagnetic emission. Not uncommon with large-scale geophysical Causing this kind of damage? I don't buy it. We're missing something here.
WOODY: ( incredulous ) Causing this kind of damage? I don't buy it. We're missing something here.
TERRI: Luke must be in pretty bad shape if he hasn't blasted out of there in the Earth Return Vehicle. That thing's designed so even one crew member could fly it back to Earth.
MCCONNELL: Even if Luke was in great shape, he couldn't get home. That energy pulse would've fried the ERV'S computers.
WOODY: Other than the computers, how do we think the ERV fared?
BECK: Well, so far our modelling says it should be in pretty good shape.
WOODY: Which means it's gonna be up to us to get new motherboards, drives, and software to Mars. As fast as we can.
BECK: Whoa, slow down. It's gonna take us weeks just to analyze this data.
MCCONNELL: Right, but meanwhile, we've gotta be working up a mission plan.
WOODY: Luke needs us now.
BECK: Luke may already be dead. And even if he's not, it's doubtful he's going to be able to transmit again. So we wouldn't know whether it's safe to land until you were almost there.
PHIL: What about SIMA?
PHIL: The Saturn Imaging Probe. It's going to slingshot around Mars on its way through the solar system. It could be retasked to take pictures, read radiation levels at Mars One Base Good idea Phil. If SIMA tells us Luke hasn't survived and it's not safe to land, we swing around Mars and come right back home.
WOODY: Good idea Phil. If SIMA tells us Luke hasn't survived and it's not safe to land, we swing around Mars and come right back home.
MCCONNELL: Yes. We can design the mission to have a free return capability. It's a long trip, but if you don't land it's the best option.
BECK: We're getting ahead of ourselves. You're forgetting the bigger problem. The orbits are all wrong. Our first decent launch window is almost eight months from now.
MCCONNELL: But we can go earlier and get there faster if we reconfigure the payload for extra fuel. We've modelled that, Ray. I've modelled it.
BECK: On paper, yeah. But those stresses have never been tested in space.
MCCONNELL: The ship can take it.
BECK: I wasn't thinking of just the ship.
MCCONNELL: I know the protocols for a Mars Recovery Mission better than anybody, because I helped design them. And I'm saying these guys can do it.
WOODY: He's right, Ray. We've got a real
BECK: Give me an updated mission plan by 0800 tomorrow. Then I'll put it in the works.
MCCONNELL: You'll have it by 0600.
MCCONNELL: Let's get to work.
WOODY: Chief, could I have a word?
OMITTED: Sequence omitted from original script.
WOODY: I've no longer got the right crew.
BECK: ( surprised ) What do you mean? Bjornstrom can be up here on the next shuttle.
WOODY: Bjornstrom is a geologist. He's good, but not for this. My people just lost eight months of training. This is a different mission, with a different objective.
BECK: I haven't been given authorization for a mission yet.
WOODY: But when you are, it ought to be given the best chance for success. I want McConnell to fly right seat.
BECK: He's no longer on mission status.
WOODY: Yeah. Because you washed him out.
BECK: He washed himself out. He only had to pass a few more psych evaluations, but he refused to take them.
WOODY: Ray, he's the best pilot I ever saw, and you've got him benched at a desk.
BECK: Everybody has to pass the psych prelims. No exceptions. Jim knew Maggie was his wife. He didn't want to lie on a couch and share her with That was his call. But I had to make one too. It was tough as hell, but I'd do it again.
WOODY: Maggie was his wife. He didn't want to lie on a couch and share her with That was his call. But I had to make one too. It was tough as hell, but I'd do it again.
BECK: That was his call. But I had to make one too. It was tough as hell, but I'd do it again.
WOODY: His wife wasted away in front of his eyes. What was he supposed to do? Suck it up? Get with the program? What was his crime? That he was upset? That he cried.?
BECK: I couldn't trust him!
BECK: ( his voice softer ) Not in a crisis. I'm sorry Woody, but Jim lost his edge. Are you gonna stand there and tell me Jim McConnell is the same man he was two years ago? You want me to bet four more lives on that?
WOODY: When Maggie died, yeah, it knocked the shit out of him. It knocked the hell out of all of us. But you know and I know that he's still the best we've got. He and Maggie wrote the book on Mars. He's got more hours in the sims than the rest of us put together. Ray, we can do this. Give me McConnell as co-pilot, and we will bring Luke home. And that's a

A SPACESHIP: Glides INTO VIEW. "MARS RECOVERY" ( formerly Mars Two ) looks much like its sister craft on Mars: a conical cockpit mounted above a "tuna can" crew Hab module.

MCCONNELL: What's that?
PHIL: That. is the exact chemical composition of my ideal woman.
MCCONNELL: Used to be.
PHIL: McConnell grins, snacking on the M&Ms.
MCCONNELL: Now what is it?
PHIL: A frog.
TERRI: I guess now we have our answer to the effects of long-term interplanetary travel on the human mind. The answer is Phil.
MCCONNELL: ( smiles ) I'm gonna get an update on SIMA. It should be just about close enough to start capturing some surface images.
MCCONNELL: Hey, Skip.
WOODY: Take a look.
WOODY: What do you make of that?
MCCONNELL: Dust storm. Southern hemisphere, coming from the east. Big fella, Headed for Chryse Planitia.
WOODY: Headed for Chryse Planitia.
MCCONNELL: Yup. Could get a little hairy just about landing time.
WOODY: We'll have to be ready to move fast. Maybe even advance our ETA. Those things can cover the whole planet, and last up to a year.
MCCONNELL: When does SIMA do her fly-by?
WOODY: Tomorrow morning, about 0600. That's when we find out whether we came all this way for nothing.
MCCONNELL: ( softly ) My money's on Luke.
TERRI: Pulls her gaze away from these numbers. Judging from her redrimmed eyes, it's been a long, anxious night. Restlessly, looking to distract herself, she reaches for a test tube of blood, straps it into a centrifuge, sets it spinning. Nearby is her electron microscope.
MCCONNELL: Shifts his eyes. The clock on his bulkhead reads "0546."
OMITTED: Sequence omitted from original script.
PHIL: What brought this on?
WOODY: Zero-G. My last chance to be graceful. Once we're in Mars gravity, it's back to shuffling my feet and grabbing her butt.
TERRI: I'll take what I can get.
MCCONNELL: Who has now arrived, is also watching the dancing couple. A twinge of sadness crosses his features. But when his eyes meet Phil's, he shakes off the feeling and manages a smile: Aren't they something? Over the music, they hear a CHIRP from the SHIP'S COMPUTER, then an announcement.
COMPUTER: Attention. Incoming packet.
MCCONNELL: It's SIMA.
WOODY: Looks deserted.
PHIL: It's still standing, though. So is the ERV. And look, there's the We know Luke survived for at least a few hours. Question is, are there any signs of recent activity?
MCCONNELL: We know Luke survived for at least a few hours. Question is, are there any signs of recent activity?
PHIL: He grabs a stylus and touches the screen. They all look.
PHIL: What the hell are those?
MCCONNELL: They all realize he's right. They sit back, stunned. But then Phil has another thought.
PHIL: Hold on. There's only three. That It means Luke must still be
TERRI: It means Luke must still be
PHIL: It means Luke must still be
TERRI: No. It just means there was nobody left to bury him.
WOODY: Check the radiation levels.
PHIL: Go to the disaster site.
WOODY: Go to the disaster site.
MCCONNELL: What's wrong?
PHIL: I don't know. Magnetic interference?
WOODY: Go to infrared.
THE SCREEN: Goes to INFRARED, reading heat, The middle of the IMAGE, where the Face is, is still distorted, refusing focus.
THE ASTRONAUTS: Sit back, exasperated.
PHIL: Must be a problem with SIMA. I don't see how an earthquake, six months ago, could give us this kind of That was no quake.
MCCONNELL: That was no quake.
WOODY: Then what the hell was it?
BECK: We're going to continue analyzing this data and try to determine what the problem is with those images. Frankly, we're just as stumped as you guys, but we'll keep on it. We agree that the evidence of the graves is inconclusive and that a ground search is advisable. Be aware there are little sand storms kicking up near Mars One Base, but the big one you spotted is turning south. It shouldn't be a factor.
BECK: We're all pretty excited here and we're sure you must be feeling the same. Enjoy your meal and get a good night's sleep. We anticipate that tomorrow morning you will be Go for Mars Orbital Insertion.

PHIL: Hey, that's a funny notion. And what if in your meal packs, instead of brown rice, there were spring-loaded spikes that shot into your eyes?

WOODY: Mission accomplished!
WOODY: Stands in the doorway of his cubicle. Their eyes meet. They both smile, turning back to the video. Remembering.
LUKE: Today we celebrate a new chapter in their story. And guys, it's a pretty historic one.
WOODY: Let's hear it for the newly-announced Captain and Co-Captain of Mars One. To Jim and Maggie!
LUKE: When you guys land, it'll prove once and for all there's no intelligent life on Mars.
MAGGIE: Hey, c'mon, what if I'm right?
ASSORTED VOICES: Oh no, here we go! Don't get her started! Somebody put on some music!
MAGGIE: It's our sister planet!
PHIL: Oh brother!
TERRI: Maggie, why does this have to be about us? Mars is a great opportunity for pure science.
MAGGIE: We'll do the science. And we'll do it very well. That's what we've trained for. But what if there's more.? In all our myths, in every human culture, Mars has always held a special attraction. What if that means something? Only we don't understand it yet.
MAGGIE: The universe is not chaos. It's connection. Life reaches out for
MAGGIE: This is what we were born for, isn't it? To stand on a new world, and look beyond it to the next one. It's who we are.
WOODY: You okay?
MCCONNELL: Yeah. I'm good to go.
MCCONNELL: After all these years. Can you believe it? Tomorrow we'll be standing on Mars.
WOODY: You know what? She may have been
WOODY: If that wasn't a quake down there, then something else caused it. Or planned it. You're thinking the same thing.
MCCONNELL: It's never been out of my mind.
WOODY: Jesus. You realize what this means?
MCCONNELL: She knew, Woody. She was the only one of us that ever thought there might be something down there.
WOODY: Yeah, and we're not leaving until we find out. Deal?
WOODY: Maggie was the best of us.
MCCONNELL: Range 6783 and closing. 35 minutes till Mars Orbital Capture.
WOODY: Okay, people let's look sharp. If we overshoot, there's no coming back.
WOODY: Charge primary APU.
WOODY: Select HPU fuel cells for run.
MCCONNELL: Tie main bus to systems.
MCCONNELL: Select H2/O2 HPU and fuel cells for H2/O2 control valves open.
TERRI: Charged and on-line
TERRI: Transfer protocol data from EVA Transferred. Awaiting track
MCCONNELL: Transfer protocol data from EVA Transferred. Awaiting track
PHIL: Transferred. Awaiting track
PHIL: PHIL HOLDS UP HIS HAND As he and Terri stare at it, dumbfounded. Thick droplets of blood leak out and begin to swirl away, sucked up towards the venting puncture in the hull over head. The astronauts' helmets dangle up there, awaiting use.
TERRI: What in God's
WOODY: ( scanning sensors ) Breach hits in the hull!
MCCONNELL: ( scanning sensors ) Breach hits in the hull!
PHIL: Outgassing! Losing pressure!
TERRI: Woody, seal the breech!
PATCH GUN: Then spins around in zero-G, as his eyes track
WOODY: Kill those alarms!
MCCONNELL: Stares at a gauge that confirms what's happening.
MCCONNELL: Still outgassing in the lower Hab! There must be another hole down there, even bigger.
PHIL: Losing pressure fast! We're gonna Computer, how long until zero Four minutes, nine seconds.
WOODY: Computer, how long until zero Four minutes, nine seconds.
COMPUTER: ( after a beat ) Four minutes, nine seconds.
PHIL: If we get below 20% atmosphere, the power will shut down!
TERRI: Are you sure?
PHIL: Positive! A vacuum inside the ship would cause a total electrical failure. The nav computers will fry!
MCCONNELL: ( to Woody ) We'll lose all control. We won't be able to fire the engines to capture Mars orbit.
PHIL: It's already starting. The primary L- 1 hub has been smashed. The systems are crashing.
WOODY: Everybody switch to suit oxygen. We beat this in the simulator, we can do it here. Jim, you've got the ship. I'm going EVA.
WOODY: C'mon, people, let's go! Let's work the problem!
THE CHAIN: From around his neck, with his little Flash Gordon rocketship WOODY HANDS THIS TO TERRI As they share a brief, loving glance, but there's no time for words. She tightens his helmet ring, and he brushes his gloved fingertips on her faceplate. Then he hurries towards the inner hatch door, where McConnell is throwing airlock switches. Woody and McConnell exchange a look. At the EVA computer panel, Phil is shutting down non-essential power drains, trying to get the main computer system back on line. His wounded hand makes this difficult and painful.
PHIL: Jesus, it's still bleeding.
TERRI: Keep the pressure on!
COMPUTER: Eighty percent atmosphere.
MCCONNELL: Floats up to them, checking on Phil's work at the computer.
TERRI: Jim, you've gotta get your spare helmet from storage.
MCCONNELL: No time. Phil, can you keep the nav computers on-line?
PHIL: I can't get this damn machine to re- initialize! And the automated systems just went down. We can't shut down the hab rotation from here.
MCCONNELL: I'll do it from below.
TERRI: We're losing pressure. You could Seventy percent atmosphere.
COMPUTER: Seventy percent atmosphere.
PHIL: Jim, I've got an idea. If you guys can save enough atmosphere, I'll disconnect the power in the main computer bay, then jump start the systems. I'll do a hard boot.
MCCONNELL: Has that ever been tested?
PHIL: Are you kidding? These machines are much too valuable.
MCCONNELL: Do it.

COMPUTER: ( a beat ) Accepted. Shutting down artificial gravitational rotation.
MCCONNELL: Hang on!
MCCONNELL: Is also jarred by the firing of the thrusters. The rotation slows until the Hab is still. Zero-G. McConnell floats. He and Terri can hear the terrifying sound of air whistling out into space through the breach hole.
COMPUTER: Sixty per cent atmosphere.
MCCONNELL: I've got a better idea. Stay there!
WOODY: Jesus, uh, OK, this is gonna be like searching for a needle in a haystack.
MCCONNELL: Shake out the liquid.
TERRI: Jim, I don't
MCCONNELL: Shake it out near the hull!

MCCONNELL: ( gasping ) Woody, the breech is in sector four! Sector four, copy that?
WOODY: ( to himself, marveling ) Sonofabitch. You never did that in the simulator.
PHIL: Where are you, you little bastard, where are you.?
COMPUTER: Forty percent atmosphere.
WOODY: ( to himself )
PHIL: PHIL TAKES A DEEP BREATH. Says a silent prayer. Then he yanks the plug. SHRILL WHINES, ELECTRONIC CRACKLES from all around him, as the systems are abruptly shut down, in a way they were never meant to be mishandled. Terrifyingly, a couple of the monitors arc to each other as they die. Dodging sparks, Phil stares at
COMPUTER: Thirty percent atmosphere.
COMPUTER: Twenty percent atmosphere.
PHIL: OK. OK now.
PHIL: Come on. Come on.!
COMPUTER: Twenty percent atmosphere.
COMPUTER: Pressure stabilizing. Atmosphere level increasing.
PHIL: Yes! Awriiiight! Had it all the way.
PHIL: He wrings his injured hand, then his gaze is caught by
PHIL: Get back in here, guys!
WOODY: Jim, there's a lot of scarring. I'd better check for other punctures while I'm out here.
WOODY: ( a beat; reluctantly ) Copy, I'm heading there now.
WOODY: Stares down at Mars, enthralled, as sunlight floods the side of the spaceship, sparkles off his visor. Dawn, after a very long night indeed. He whispers lovingly, under his breath.
WOODY: Hey, Beautiful.
OMITTED: Sequence omitted from original script.
WOODY: ( whispers ) Know what? You've got enough left.
TERRI: Piece of cake?
WOODY: Well. Easier than the cha-cha.
PHIL: I don't know what you're getting so cocky about. We scored better times in the sim at least twice.
MCCONNELL: ( grins ) How's his hand?
TERRI: Seems OK. Couple of the tendons are going to be a little tight for awhile. Try to close your fingers, Phil, nice and slowly.
PHIL: Well, at least I'll still be able to
MARS RECOVERY: Sails INTO VIEW, with small attitude thrusters firing as the great ship maneuvers into position for its orbital-capture burn. Mars looks very large, blood-red. The entire spectacle is majestic, awe-inspiring.
WOODY: OK, we're ready to light this candle. Go/No Go for braking burn and MOI.
MCCONNELL: We are Go for the burn. I'm fueling the engines.
WOODY: We are Go for the burn. I'm fueling the engines.
TERRI: We are Go for the burn. I'm fueling the engines.
WOODY: We are Go for the burn. I'm fueling the engines.
PHIL: We are Go for the burn. I'm fueling the engines.
WOODY: We are Go for the burn. I'm fueling the engines.
PHIL: Four. Three.
WOODY: McConnell, moved by this honor, nods. He reaches out to throw the switch himself.
MCCONNELL: Let's go to Mars.
WOODY: What the

WOODY: Engines negative! No response! I've got no attitude control!
MCCONNELL: Manual separation! Blow the bolts!

WOODY: Okay. Let's go.
WIDE SHOT: Of Woody leading them away from the crippled spaceship, against the magnificent backdrop of the blood-red planet below. Four tiny figures, all alone in space.
TERRI: What're you looking for?
PHIL: ( softly, sadly ) ( beat ) Hey. When we get back? We really will have to try this in the sim.
TERRI: ( beat ) Hey. When we get back? We really will have to try this in the sim.
MCCONNELL: How we doin' on fuel, Woody?
WOODY: I'm at fifty percent. But I don't see the REMO.
THEIR POV: Everyone is looking back at the curve of Mars against black space, expecting to see the REMO coming up behind them.
TERRI: Happens to glance directly below.
TERRI: There she is!
THEIR POV: The black outline of the little cargo craft drifts against the red of Mars.
WOODY: Jesus. She's not where I thought she'd be.
PHIL: We're going to miss her.
WOODY: Looks again at his display screen, frustrated.
MCCONNELL: What do you think?
WOODY: We can't catch it. Not like this.
MCCONNELL: ( thinking quickly ) Use the tether.
MCCONNELL: We'll only have one, maybe two shots before she's out of reach.
WOODY: It'll be better if I leave you the gun while I run out to the REMO. I've got enough fuel left for that.
MCCONNELL: You'll be going too fast.
WOODY: I'll aim to overshoot, then brake like hell; arc it in.
WOODY: Seeya in a few.
WOODY: Okay. I'm on path to overshoot. I'm gonna take the edge off.
WOODY'S EYES: Show alarm. He checks his display.
WOODY: I'm out. Coming in hot. Still long. Abandoning the unit. I'll brake with suit jets.
WOODY'S POV: He's still going very quickly.
TERRI: Oh Jesus. Jesus.
WOODY: Suit jets gone. But I'm gonna make
INTERCUT: At what velocity?
MCCONNELL: At what velocity?
WOODY: Impact's gonna be a little rough.
MCCONNELL: At what velocity?
WOODY: ( beat )

WOODY: No! You slow me and I'll fall short.
MCCONNELL: It's too fast, Woody.

WOODY: Is past the REMO, freefalling toward Mars.
TERRI: McConnell hits a button on the tether gun and starts to reel them quickly in towards the REMO.
WOODY: Tries his suit jets again they're empty.
HIS POV: Falling away from the REMO.
MCCONNELL: Woody, what's your status?
INTERCUTTING: ( after a beat ) Uh, well, no suit jets and I'm still carrying a good deal of velocity.
WOODY: ( after a beat ) Uh, well, no suit jets and I'm still carrying a good deal of velocity.
MCCONNELL: As soon as we get hooked up, I'll come get you.
WOODY: ( after a beat ) Uh, I'd have to say negative on that, Negative on the transmission?
MCCONNELL: Negative on the transmission?
WOODY: No, I heard you. Negative on the maneuver. I am not retrievable.
TERRI: Woody, that's not possible. You're not going that fast.
WOODY: It comes down to the amount of fuel, honey. The suit jets were designed for attitude control, not travel. Retrieval just won't work.
PHIL: It has to work!
WOODY: Hey, believe me, I don't like it any more than you do.
TERRI: Run the numbers, Jim.
WOODY: Run the numbers, Jim.
MCCONNELL: I am.
MCCONNELL: Woody, you hang tight. We'll get into the REMO, fire her up, drop her into a lower orbit and come scoop you up.
WOODY: Sounds good, Jim.
TERRI: It's gonna take half an hour to get the REMO reoriented! Woody'll be. He'll be in the atmosphere by then!
MCCONNELL: Then we'll have to get her moving We don't have time!
TERRI: We don't have time!
WOODY: You listen to Jim, honey. It's a good plan.
TERRI: No! We are going to
PHIL: Oh Jesus, look! The ship!
MCCONNELL: Look out!
THEIR POV: They are drifting quickly into the REMO.
MCCONNELL: ALL THREE Fire their suit jets, slowing themselves down. They bang into the REMO at about one-tenth the speed Woody did. They find handholds and grab on. McConnell hits a button on the tether gun.
ALL THREE: Fire their suit jets, slowing themselves down. They bang into the REMO at about one-tenth the speed Woody did. They find handholds and grab on. McConnell hits a button on the tether gun.
THE HOOK: Releases from the REMO's hull. McConnell hits another button and it is reeled all the way into the gun. Phil is already scrabbling at a latch on the REMO's outer airlock door.
MCCONNELL: Okay, let's get inside! Phil, start dumping the cargo, or there won't be room for us.
PHIL: But we need those supplies for
MCCONNELL: Dump the cargo. Hang on, Woody!
WOODY: Is looking back at the REMO. Smiles with relief to see that Terri has reached it safely.
WOODY: Will do, Jim.
MARS: Right below him, filling his field of view. A long beat.
WOODY: ( softly ) Hey, Beautiful.
MCCONNELL: Terri, no!
MCCONNELL: Is reaching to activate his own jets, when
PHIL'S HAND: Grabs at his wrist, restraining this suicidal courage. They stare at each other. McConnell wrenches his hand free, half- maddened, agonized, staring after Terri.
MCCONNELL: Goddammit, Terri, it won't work!
WOODY: Looks back at the REMO, as he continues to fall towards Mars. Sees the small figure of his wife heading towards him.
WOODY: Terri, what are you doing?
INTERCUT: I'll tell you what I'm not doing, Woody. I'm not going to watch you You'd do the same for me.
TERRI: I'll tell you what I'm not doing, Woody. I'm not going to watch you You'd do the same for me.
WOODY: You'd do the same for me.
TERRI: You'd do the same for me.
MCCONNELL: Get inside. Dump the cargo, then start the systems.
WOODY: No. I wouldn't come for you. Not if it just wasn't possible.
TERRI: I can do it!
WOODY: No, Terri, you can't! You don't have enough fuel to get me, stop us both, and get us back. Hell, you come any farther and you won't have enough to get back yourself.
WOODY: Listen to me, goddammit! You have to stop! You have to stop now!
MCCONNELL: He's right, Terri. It's no use.
TERRI: Releases her thumb from the toggle control.
TERRI: Drifts, staring towards Woody.
WOODY: Okay, honey.? You gotta go back The hell I do.
TERRI: The hell I do.
THE HOOK: Comes shooting out of the gun, wire spooling out behind it.
WOODY: Watches as it comes shooting down toward him.
WOODY: Looks at the drifting hook, ten agonizing meters away from him. His only life preserver.
TERRI: Hits the button and the wire starts winching fast back into the gun.
WOODY: What are you doing?
TERRI: I'm gonna jet a little closer and try again.
WOODY: Terri, you spend any fuel getting closer, you won't get back, and if anyone tries to get you, they'll die
THE HOOK: Is whipping back toward Terri and the gun. Woody's voice cracks; he's very close to tears. Pleading now.
WOODY: Honey, please go back. Go back and help everyone get down to the surface.
TERRI: I am not losing you.
WOODY: I can't let you do it. I can't. I'm
TERRI: Looks at Woody, two hundred meters away, sensing something different in his voice now, a terrible resolve.
TERRI: Raises his hands to his helmet ring. His eyes shining.
WOODY: Raises his hands to his helmet ring. His eyes shining.
WOODY: I love you, Terri. God how I love
TERRI: Woody, nooooooo.!!!
TERRI: Woody, oh Woody, please God, no!
HER THUMB: Hovers over her suit jet toggle control. McConnell's voice, from the distance, sounds very tired. Like he's aged fifty years in the blink of an eye.
MCCONNELL: Come back, Terri.
MCCONNELL: ( quietly, simply ) He's gone.
MCCONNELL: Please, Terri. We need you.
TERRI'S THUMB: Pushes the toggle control. to one side, not forward.
TERRI'S FACE: Inside her helmet, is streaming with tears. She turns herself around, reluctantly. Heads slowly back towards the REMO.
NEW CAPCOM: Okay, they're Go for the burn and MOI. Should be initiating the burn just about. now.
RAY BECK: Takes a step forward, staring helplessly at the screen. His face goes pale, stricken. His worst nightmare is taking place, right before his eyes and for the second mission in a EXT. REMO. MARS ORBIT. NIGHT The REMO is now on the night side of Mars. Cargo boxes, packing cases and assorted equipment containers float outside. The hatch is sealed.
MCCONNELL: Stares at these, thinking hard, remembering. He's holding a palm-sized computer, already wired into this panel. He begins tapping the keys, but then stops himself. Reconsiders. He turns, looking back at
PHIL'S FACE: Is a map of torment. He is shivering, both from cold and fear, barely holding himself together. He hugs his computer supply case like a scared child would hug a teddy bear.
TERRI: Is worse. A thousand-yard stare. She's in shock.
MCCONNELL: Knows he has to occupy them. Speaks softly.
MCCONNELL: ( no response ) Hey, Phil.?
MCCONNELL: We're going in blind. We'll deploy the chutes by laptop. I need to get on the data bus, put in a software patch, and try to soften this tin can's landing. I could use your help with the patch.
MCCONNELL: That's great. Good job. Hey, Terri, I was wondering. Think maybe we could rig some kind of seatbelts out of those cargo straps?
MCCONNELL: Studies both of their faces intently. Knows that he can't push them too hard, too fast. They're moving like robots, but at least they're moving.

NEW CAPCOM: Ray.? We've got some new data, just coming in.
NEW CAPCOM: We just it doesn't make any sense. We're not sure how to read this.

BECK: ( pause ) No sir. Under power.
NEW CAPCOM: No sir. Under power.
BECK: NEW CAPCOM
NEW CAPCOM: Sixty-three minutes after Mars Recovery went off-line. Sir, the graph reads like a controlled descent. But that doesn't make any

BECK: It's McConnell, it's got to be! Nobody else could have pulled this off. Son of a bitch! They're alive.
OMITTED: Sequence omitted from original script.
PANNING: We see that sand has drifted high against the Hab, as well as the sides of the partially-deflated tunnel and greenhouse, and the four-man rover. The oxygen still and propellant plant are almost buried. Solar panels, some of them punctured by micrometeors, FLAP and CREAK eerily in the slight breeze. And finally,
MCCONNELL: ( pause ) Damn right.
PHIL: ( pause ) Damn right.
MCCONNELL: Terri, let's see if that oxygen still is operational. Phil, you better check out the ERV. I'll take the Hab. If you find Luke's
MCCONNELL: Just keep in touch.
MCCONNELL: ( on radio ) I'm at the main airlock door.
MCCONNELL: Entering Hab.
PHIL: I've got ERV access. I'm going in. Terri, you okay?
TERRI: Yeah. This is gonna take awhile to get back to 100% capacity.
MCCONNELL SHIVERS: This place is filled with ghosts.
PHIL: ERV appears structurally intact. Computers are fried, just as we
TERRI: Copy that. I've got busted filters here, clogged intakes. Helluva cleanup job, but so far no major damage.
MCCONNELL: Reaches into a bucket, touches the water. His glove comes up before his wondering eyes, dripping. Grasping the implication, he looks down at his forearm instrument pad. Blinking red letters read "25 deg. C." And something else the puffy white material of his suit is starting to slightly deflate, revealing his arm's shape. There's air pressure in Punches in more numbers, and gets the readout: "Nitr. 78%/ 02 20%/ C02 1%/ Trace gasses 1%."
MCCONNELL: Punches in more numbers, and gets the readout: "Nitr. 78%/ 02 20%/ C02 1%/ Trace gasses 1%."
MCCONNELL: Slowly reaches up, unsealing the neck ring of his helmet. He hesitates, then lifts it off. Takes a deep, quenching lungful of pure air. Holds it in. Lets it slowly out. For a moment he doesn't trust his own voice. Then speaks softly towards his helmet.
MCCONNELL: I'm in the greenhouse. You better. you better come see this for
PHIL: What is it?
TERRI: INT. GREENHOUSE. DAY McConnell sets down his helmet, starts exploring, pushing through fronds as he makes his way down an aisle. The dripping foliage is so dense it almost chokes his path. Everywhere he looks, he has the sense of a scrounged-together, recycled, jury-rigged environment, where a great deal of ingenuity has come into play. He pauses, looking up. Overhead, a bellows, stitched together from pieces of plastic tarp, slowly inhales and exhales, pumping air into a vent in the upper deck of the Hab. Its power comes from a crude water wheel, a buckets-and-strut assemblage, tidily sutured with duct tape, like some giant Erector set. As McConnell turns away from this, still marvelling, a ragged figure leaps through the foliage! It smashes into him, with a HARSH SCREECH, knocking him to the ground. McConnell, on his back, straddled by his attacker, fights back as best he can. A blur of flailing arms and fists, as he tries to push the creature away. Staring up, he catches a glimpse of the almost unrecognizable
LUKE GRAHAM: Whose frightened eyes glare back at him through a swaying curtain of dreadlocks. His skin is creased, weathered, above a scraggly beard. His clothes are tattered, patched together. In one fist he grips a rock hammer, which he swings high overhead, about to drive the claw through McConnell's skull. McConnell grabs his arm desperately, trying to fend him off.
MCCONNELL: Luke, it's me! Jim McConnell!
LUKE: You're not here!
MCCONNELL: Luke, it's Jim!
LUKE: No, no, you're not. you can't be Your wife is Debra! Your son is Bobby! You were reading Treasure Island with him.!

MCCONNELL: Luke, what happened here?
LUKE: ( whispers ) We fired the radar. It came. They all died.
MCCONNELL: What came?
LUKE: They all died, but I was spared. Why? Had to be for a reason. Then, all of a sudden, I knew why I was
LUKE: So somebody would be left to figure out the secret.
MCCONNELL: Luke, we still don't understand.
LUKE: Come. Comecomecome. Is it just me? Or is he about two mealpacks short of a picnic?
PHIL: Is it just me? Or is he about two mealpacks short of a picnic?
TERRI: Long term exposure to low gravity can have an adverse impact on the brain. He could be suffering from a form of asphyxia.
MCCONNELL: Or maybe his whole crew died and he's been marooned alone on Mars. Let's give him time to adjust.
PHIL: EXT. MARS ONE BASE CAMP. DAY Luke, now in a patched-up pressure suit and grubby-looking helmet, stands peering down unhappily at the improvised sledge, with its meager supplies. McConnell, Terri, and Phil walk up behind him, wearing their helmets again. They hear Luke over his RADIO.
LUKE: So. let me be sure I understand this. Your ship blew up, with all its supplies. Then you emptied the cargo out of the REMO, and it was totalled on landing. You've got no food, no water, no spare oxygen, nothing but what I see here.?
LUKE: What kinda rescue mission is this?
MCCONNELL: That kind.
PHIL: Check it out. New nav boards for the ERV. I got four round-trip tickets, baby, right in here.
LUKE: ( softly )

TERRI: Thanks, Luke.
LUKE: When there's time, we'll talk.

THEIR POV: The Lab is crammed with rock and sand samples from many locations, all tagged and labelled. There are drawings and diagrams covering the walls: Martian landscapes, annotated maps, and over and over, obsessively repeated, drawings of the vortex that destroyed the Mars One crew.
LUKE: See, where they made their mistake was, they must've planned for it to be visible from Earth.
MCCONNELL: Who's "they"?
LUKE: Don't you understand? Hundreds of millions of years have gone by. You've got erosion, sand storms, lava flows, meteor impacts hell, in that much time, the whole surface would've changed. So no wonder we never saw it before. Well, I mean, we saw it, but not like they meant us too. Too much dirt on it.
TERRI: Saw what?
LUKE: On the computer screen they're looking at.
PHIL: What is that.?
TERRI: What is that.?
LUKE: I don't know. But whatever it is, somebody built it. And not us.
MCCONNELL: What about the sound? That signal you heard before the explosion?
LUKE: Good, Jim, good. That's the key.
LUKE: Hear the pauses? That's what made me realize it's a pattern a repeating
MCCONNELL: Luke is trembling with excitement. His words tumble out very quickly. He's been waiting so long to share this.
LUKE: That's what I thought. There are distinct blocks in the pattern, and within each block the tones come in groups of three. Threethreethree. For months I struggled to analyze it, trying different constructs. Then I thought about dimensions.
MCCONNELL: X-Y-Z coordinates.
LUKE: Right! Three groups equals three dimensions. So I tried assigning different graphic values to each block, group and tone. And finally I got. this.
PHIL: My God. Is that what I think it DNA. that's a model of DNA!
TERRI: DNA. that's a model of DNA!
LUKE: You see it, too. Thank God. I was afraid I was just suffering from a form of asphyxia.
PHIL: So, okay, so somebody left this thing here, somebody other than human. But what the hell is it?
LUKE: My guess is, it's a signature. A self-portrait of whatever species created the Face.
MCCONNELL: But that DNA looks human.
TERRI: No way. It's missing the last pair of chromosomes. See?
MCCONNELL: Yeah, but it's close. Damn close.
TERRI: The difference between a man and an ape is less than three percent of genetic material. But that three percent gives you Mozart. Einstein.
PHIL: Or Jack the Ripper.
MCCONNELL: When he finally speaks, never takes his eyes off the screen. We can read in them the almost overwhelming grip this mystery has on his imagination.
MCCONNELL: It's been a long day. Let's get a couple hours sleep, then tackle this thing when we're fresher. Phil, your first priority will be to get the motherboards over to the ERV. Concentrate on getting communications up first. Soon as we've got the juice, we'll send a packet to Micker, tell them Luke's OK, and that. everything else that's happened. The rest of us will take an inventory of supplies, see where we stand. Okay?
TERRI: C'mon. There's a pair of scissors in my medkit.
OMITTED: Sequence omitted from original script.
MCCONNELL: How do you feel?
LUKE: Like I just got back my other three
TERRI: The backup generator is salvageable, and two of the solar panels. I'm pretty sure I can get the oxygen still back into production, too. So we're not in such bad shape, Good work, Terri.
LUKE: Good work, Terri.
MCCONNELL: Look at that. Phil's idea of absolute
OMITTED: Sequence omitted from original script.
MCCONNELL: It's not a signature.
LUKE: ( puzzled ) That noise from the Face. It's not a signature. It's a test.
MCCONNELL: That noise from the Face. It's not a signature. It's a test.
MCCONNELL: It's asking us for the right answer. It wants us to put in the missing pair of chromosomes.
LUKE: But why?
MCCONNELL: To prove that we're human.
LUKE: We fired radar into that thing. Concentrated sound waves.
MCCONNELL: Which it interpreted as a wrong answer. Yes! It's like a, a security alarm. When it gets an incorrect response, it defends itself.
PHIL: So what happens when it gets the right answer?
MCCONNELL: ( hesitates ) I don't know. But we've got to find ( to Luke, pointing ) Can you work this the other way? Figure out which tones would be equivalent to the missing chromosomes? Then dub them into your recording of the signal?
LUKE: I think so, yes.
MCCONNELL: What about the radar gun? Will it accept that input? Can we transmit a completed signal back to the Face?
PHIL: Whoa, whoa, hold on, Jim. What if you're wrong? Whoever goes out there. I mean, what if you're wrong? Three people have already died over that thing.
TERRI: McConnell looks at her.
MCCONNELL: Terri, if we leave here without getting some answers, they all died in vain.
TERRI: We just don't know enough about that that thing out there to take any more chances.
MCCONNELL: What are we here for, if not to take
MCCONNELL: This means we're not alone. It means we're on the brink of the greatest discovery in mankind's history. But we've still got to prove it. Who knows when someone else will get back here? Or if they ever will? You know what Congress is like. They'll say it's too dangerous, too much loss of life, let's go back to unmanned flights. We could be the last explorers to come here for decades. We're it, guys. We're it.
LUKE: ( quietly ) We don't have to go out there. There's a better way.
OMITTED: Sequence omitted from original script.
LUKE: Checking video feed.
LUKE: ON THE MONITOR They see the familiar stark white profile of the FACE, shot from ground level, in a SLOWLY APPROACHING ANGLE.
MCCONNELL: How close do we need to get?
LUKE: I'm not sure. Maybe we better stop by that boulder.
PHIL: Oh my God.
LUKE: It worked. It worked!
MCCONNELL: Check for radiation.
LUKE: Normal. Seismic. normal. Anemometer steady. No sign of the vortex.
PHIL: I don't know what we did, but guys does that look to you like a hostile No. More like an invitation.
TERRI: No. More like an invitation.
LUKE: Or another test.
MCCONNELL: Luke, the four-man rover. Does it still work?
OMITTED: Sequence omitted from original script.
THE ASTRONAUTS: Stare at this unholy juggernaut, alarmed. McConnell turns to Luke, whose expression is grim.
MCCONNELL: How long before it hits?
LUKE: An hour? Maybe less.
MCCONNELL: How bad?
LUKE: A storm like that? It could go planetary. And last a year.
LUKE: It'll sock us in, Jim. We won't be able to take off. If that happens, with what few supplies we've got left.? We'll starve to death.
MCCONNELL: Phil, how much longer to prep the
ERV?: Maybe forty-five minutes. It'll be tight, but we can make it.
PHIL: Maybe forty-five minutes. It'll be tight, but we can make it.
MCCONNELL: Then there's still time for us to get out there and back.
MCCONNELL: Stay here. Continue the repair. If something goes wrong, you get out of here before that storm hits.
PHIL: Go back. alone?
MCCONNELL: If we're not back in forty-five minutes, I want you to prep and That's 1950 hours.
PHIL: It's not a suggestion, it's an order. You understand?
MCCONNELL: It's not a suggestion, it's an order. You understand?
PHIL: ( reluctantly ) I understand. But
MCCONNELL: You understand what?
PHIL: If you're not back by 1950, I prep and launch.
MCCONNELL: Let's go.
MCCONNELL: Phil, do you read me?
PHIL: Yeah, Jim. Your signal's breaking up a little in the storm, but I read
MCCONNELL: We're at the Face. We're gonna need a few minutes here. Same deadline, launch at 1950. With or without us. Do you copy?
PHIL: ( pause ) Copy that.
TERRI: Jim, are you sure you want to do I'm not sure of anything anymore. But I didn't come a hundred million miles just to turn back in the last ten feet.
MCCONNELL: I'm not sure of anything anymore. But I didn't come a hundred million miles just to turn back in the last ten feet.
MCCONNELL: Surface seems firm and level.
LUKE: Roger that. Texture is smooth.
TERRI: I've got good footing and no obstructions. Let's check our
TERRI: It's solid again! We're trapped.
MCCONNELL: Don't move! Keep this orientation.
MCCONNELL: ( keys his mike ) Phil? Phil, can you still hear me?
PHIL: Computers are online! Ready to load software. But guys we're losing visibility here.
PHIL: Guys.? Jim? Luke? Terri? Is anyone
PHIL: Don't leave me.
TERRI: ( alarmed ) Jim, what're you doing? You'll I don't think so.
MCCONNELL: I don't think so.
LUKE: Jim, seal it!
MCCONNELL: No. That was air going into my suit, not out. Look at your own suits they're not rigid anymore. We've got pressure in here.
TERRI: Above Mars atmospheric? That's We're millions of miles from Earth and we're inside a gigantic white face. What's impossible?
MCCONNELL: We're millions of miles from Earth and we're inside a gigantic white face. What's impossible?
TERRI: There's six psi in here. Nitrogen and oxygen.
LUKE: Otherwise known as air?
TERRI: Hey, there may be some lethal trace gasses I haven't picked up yet, or. or. oh, the hell with it.
INTERCUT: ( softly ) Is that what I think it is?
MCCONNELL: ( softly ) Is that what I think it is?
LUKE: Yeah. It's Mars.
TERRI: Oh my God.
THE ASTRONAUTS: Stare at this devastation, deeply moved.
EARTH: As it was then. More clouds than now, more ocean, and the landforms all wedged together.
TERRI: Her voice is soft.
TERRI: Earth, when it was still Pangaea. Before the continents separated.
LIVING FORMS: Flash into the holographic column, swimming, growing, crawling, leaping, flying: one-celled microscopic organisms, plankton, plants of all kinds, insects, then fish, dinosaurs, birds, small mammals, larger mammals the entire stunning panorama of evolution, distilled into a single explosive sequence, as the images wash over the dazzled, awestruck
THE MARTIAN: Now comes forward with outstretched arms and completes their circle, taking the fourth position. McConnell is opposite her glowing form, and Terri and Luke are at either side. The Martian reaches her arms out, inviting them to link hands. As they do so, the Martian seems to be staring directly into McConnell's eyes.
MCCONNELL: Is in wondrous awe, his whole face radiant with joy. It's the first time we've ever seen him utterly without sadness or reserve. Staring at the Martian, he understands.
MCCONNELL: They're us. We're them.
LUKE: We're Martians.?
MCCONNELL: That's what she means.
TERRI: Oh my God. The Cambrian explosion.
TERRI: Almost six hundred million years ago, there was a sudden expansion of life on Earth. The first multi-celled plants and animals appeared. No one has ever understood why.
LUKE: They seeded Earth.
THE ASTRONAUTS: Step back, startled, unlinking their hands, and look at the circle of colored rings. These shade from yellow, on the outer rim, to a deeper yellow, then orange, then finally reds. Inside the final, deep red ring is a circle of indigo blue, about a meter across. Small points of light glitter here, like stars against a midnight sky.
THE MARTIAN: Steps closer to McConnell. She has picked him out in particular. Now she beckons for him to move inside the circle of colored rings, to stand on the indigo core.
MCCONNELL: Looks back at her, nods his understanding. For the first time she seems to smile. Benevolence, reassurance. Then as abruptly as she first appeared, she fades away. Vanishes. Luke and Terri look at McConnell, confused. There is a sudden, static-filled CRACKLE from their helmets, nearby on the floor.
PHIL: ( over radio ) .in, please. Can you. me?
TERRI: Phil, we're here! We read you.
PHIL: Thank God! Listen, this storm is few more minutes, I can't You've gotta get back to the ship!
TERRI: Phil? Phil.?
MCCONNELL: We are in a ship. This is a ship. And the countdown has already started.
LUKE: He's right.
TERRI: Then let's get the hell out of here!
LUKE: McConnell doesn't turn.
LUKE: Jim, we gotta go.
MCCONNELL: I'm not coming with you.
TERRI: ( stunned )
TERRI: What are you talking about? We've got to get home.
MCCONNELL: That's where I'm going. Don't you see? That's what all this is for. You were right Terri. This is an invitation. To follow them. To follow them home. I have to go. This is the mission now. To find out who we are. Isn't that why we came here? Like Maggie said, "To stand on a new world and look beyond it to the next one." You know, when you think about it I wasn't even supposed to be here all the accidents, everything that got us to this point, it's just. it's just. I just know it's right.

MCCONNELL: I'm okay. I know what I'm doing. But you're running out of time. You've gotta get back to the ERV and get off this planet. Now please go.
LUKE: I once felt like I was taking your turn. But now I think maybe you're taking mine. Guess I'm a little
LUKE: Thanks for saving my life.
MCCONNELL: My pleasure.
TERRI: I wish Woody were here to see this. He would've wanted to go too, Jim.
MCCONNELL: He's here, Terri. We wouldn't have made it without him.
TERRI: Take care, Jim.
LUKE: Hey, Jim.?
MCCONNELL: Have a great ride.
LUKE: Have a great ride.
MCCONNELL: Always do.
MCCONNELL: Looks down at what Terri gave him.
MCCONNELL: Grips this tightly as he looks up.

LUKE: Phil? Phil, do you read? He's not reading.
TERRI: I can barely read you. Let's get the hell out of here!
PHIL: Is anyone there? Can anyone read me?
MCCONNELL: Fights against a stab of claustrophobia. Is he being imprisoned? Or somehow protected? Either way, he's virtually immobilized. In this tight space in his bulky suit, he can't even move his arms. Only his head and neck can still shift.
DIGITAL CLOCK: Which reads "1350."
MCCONNELL'S EYES: Widen in alarm. He strains against the sides of the cylinder HIS GLOVED HANDS Slide helplessly across the smooth surface.
MCCONNELL: Looks down again.
MCCONNELL: Cranes his neck, staring up. Can he wedge himself higher, can he somehow climb to safety?
ABOVE HIM: The entire "ceiling" of the Face is becoming translucent. He can see the dust storm, boiling overhead. And now, rising into this, are fiery coils of energy from the Face itself. These swirl and twist in every direction, like angry water snakes; battered by the fierce winds. Two vast forces on a collision course.
TERRI: I've lost the Base Camp beacon!
TERRI: No good! We're driving blind.
LUKE: I'll try to keep on a straight line! It's our only chance.
TERRI: Don't worry! I've worked with Phil for four years! I know Jim gave him a direct order, but he won't leave without us.
PHIL: This is ERV, do you read? ERV to Rover, do you read.?
PHIL: This is ERV, do you read?
LUKE: ( very faint ) Save the fuel, Phil. We're coming
PHIL: Uh, Phil's not here right now. He left for Earth five minutes ago. Please leave your message at the
PHIL: Where's Jim?
TERRI: He got another ride.
LUKE: Tell you on the way. Let's go!
OMITTED: Sequence omitted from original script.
MCCONNELL: Squeezes his eyes shut, holding his breath. Not so much fighting this anymore as simply floating in place, waiting for his inevitable death.
OMITTED: Sequence omitted from original script.
MCCONNELL'S FACE: Is spinning and shaking too, more and more violently, as the huge buildup of G-forces tears at his body. We're reminded of Nick Willis just before the vortex exploded him; is the same thing about to happen to McConnell? His eyes remain tightly shut, bubbles are streaming from his lips. His last breath is nearly exhausted, it's being shaken from his lungs.

MAGGIE MCCONNELL: In an astronaut's pressure suit, drifts rapidly towards us, reeling in along a tether. A man's gloved hand is outstretched, reaching for her. As she grips the hand, we see her triumphant expression through her faceplate. A blinding flash; she's gone.
MCCONNELL: Smiles back.
