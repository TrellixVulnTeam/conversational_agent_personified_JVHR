MORPHEUS: "Niobe, theyre closing."
NIOBE: "How many?"
MORPHEUS: "Just a few. Maybe two or three. Hundred."
NIOBE: "Youve got a gift for understatement."
MAN: "Oh shit, were screwed. We gotta set down and EMP em."
CIRCA: "Multiple bogies closing!"
NIOBE: "No shit."
CIRCA: "From the front!"
CIRCA: "Are they - "
NIOBE: "They're ours."
TANK: "We're home."
TRINITY: "Well, not yet, but we're in the defense screen."
NEO: "What's that?"
MORPHEUS: "A concentric ring of defenses that shields Zion. The fighters that
MORPHEUS: "For the moment, perhaps. Its still a long drive home."
FADE OUT: FADE INTO: TRINITY'S CABIN. At first we see only stars twinkling, faraway diamonds on a black velvet background. The camera descends through the darkness, to a sunset, dark blue, as if just after sunset. The artwork terminates in the metal ring going around her room. It's a much more hospitable place than the rest of the dreary hovercraft. The articles she's collected during her time in the resistance dot the cabin. An unfinished sweatshirt sits on a loom. There are charcoal portraits of loved ones. Softly lit, the cabin sways slightly. The NEB is still in tow. NEO is sitting against the wall on Trin's bed, with her curled up beside him with her head on his lap. Neo cant sleep. He stares at the wall opposite him. There's a photo of the crew of the NEB, sans Trin, in better days. Smiling, laughing as they are seated around the table. Morpeus, Tank, Dozer, Switch, Epoch, Mouse. Neo stops on the image of a smiling CYPHER. There's an unknown Asian man in the photo, looking withdrawn and a bit lonely. Gently, placing Trinity's head down, NEO stands and examines the
TRINITY: "I'll have to take that one down now. Cypher."
NEO: "Who is this guy?"
TRINITY: NEO points to the mystery man.
TRINITY: "That was. I. forgot his name."
NEO: "What happened to him?"
NEO: "Was he like me?"
TRINITY: "Not you, though. Like you. There have been others, Neo."
NEO: "No. I've never been a big sleeper."
TRINITY: "I know. I used to watch you hacking without sleeping for days."
NEO: "How many 'ones' have there been?"
TRINITY: "That's not the point."
TRINITY: "You are him. Youre mine."
NEO: "But what does it mean, to be The One?"
TRINITY: "I don't know, Neo. Our mission was to find you."
NEO: "So, now what?"
TRINITY: "Now, Zion will give us a new mission." The hatch swings open. MORPHEUS peers in.
MORPHEUS: "We're almost home. We'll need a detail. Five minutes."
NEO: "Does he ever knock?"
TRINITY: "Not on his ship."
MORPHEUS: SHE shakes his hand, the shake slows down.
"M.": "Thanks for the rescue."
MORPHEUS: "Thanks for the rescue."
CHOI: "Brough, you us your asses! We saved you so hard core you don't even
CHOI: "So, you think you finally found The One, huh? Another One?" DUJOUR, CHOI'S LIEUTENANT, pushes into their conversation, looking
DUJOUR: "Idiot, we helped him find him. Hello, Morpheus."
CHOI: He looks at what she's seeing. His gaze halts on NEO. He's concentrating on TANK and his apparent girlfriend, who seems to be consoling him. He turns to see CHOI and DUJOUR, does a double-take,
NEO: CHOI is quick to resume his cool.
CHOI: "In the flesh, so to speak."
DUJOUR: "Welcome to the real world, Neo. I'm glad you're here."
CHOI: "What do you think, Dujour? Should we take him with us?"
DUJOUR: MORPHEUS turns from Niobe and a Zion officer. He addresses Trinity, glancing at the others.
CHOI: MORPHEUS turns from Niobe and a Zion officer. He addresses Trinity, glancing at the others.
MORPHEUS: "Go on ship's liberty. Meet me in the Dead Duck at 21:00 hours, drunk
CHOI: "See, man? This is home. This is the main street. One of em, anyway.
CHOI: "Our energy as a people is directed toward liberation. Check it out,
NEO: "Where did they come from?"
CHOI: "Energy plant we raided on our last mission. There were some
NEO: "How are their minds freed from the Matrix?"
TRINITY: "With difficulty."
DUJOUR: "If at all."
WAITRESS: "Welcome home, brothers and sisters. First day back?"
CHOI: "Yes, lovely."
WAITRESS: "On the house, then. Four rums?"
TRINITY: "Make it eight."
TRINITY: "Any casualties?" CHOI lights up and takes a drag.
CHOI: "Two. Sidewinder and Left-right."
DUJOUR: "I cant believe Cypher turned. Bastard."
CHOI: "He who loses faith."
DUJOUR: "Neo, we monitored your fight. Did you really gain enlightenment?"
NEO: "All I know is I kicked Smiths ass."
CHOI: "Fuckin finally, Jesus Christ. Its about time we iced that bastard."
DUJOUR: "Yeah, we finally won against an agent?"
CHOI: "I guess 1 n 298 isnt a bed record, huh?" CHOI holds his glass aloft. They raise their glasses to toast.
CHOI: "Live free or die."
NEO: "God, how do you do that?"
TRINITY: "Youve never drank before."
DUJOUR: "Not for real."
CHOI: "You want to know what being The One means?"
NEO: "One drink and youre toast."
CHOI: "One drink and youre toast."
DUJOUR: "Neo, you know what else youve never done?"
NEO: "Yeah, youve never done it."
DUJOUR: "Yeah, youve never done it."
CHOI: "And virtual doesnt count, man, doesnt fucking count."
NEO: "Well. Ill drink to that."
CHOI: "Here, here."
MORPHEUS: "So, how do you like having your own command?"
NIOBE: "Its good. But trying. The responsibility." THEY stop before the entrance to the DEAD DUCK.
MORPHEUS: "You must be both mother and father to your crew."
NIOBE: "Who will you be now? The mother, or the father?"
MORPHEUS: "As long as they dont get out of line, Ill just be a brother."
CHOI: "So, you went back in, and you two pulled him out?" TRINITY nods, herself in disbelief. NEO picks his head up off the
NEO: "Kicked. kicked Smiths ass." CHOI eyes MORPHES and NIOBE coming toward them.
CHOI: "Hey, did you kick anybody elses ass, Neo? Like Morpheus?"
NEO: "Morpheus? Yeah, I smacked him around, too."
MORPHEUS: "So, you can smack me around, Neo?"
NEO: "Oh yeah. Anytime."
TRINITY: "Hows Tank?"
MORPHEUS: "Hes on bereavement leave with his mother. Dozer was the second son
MORPHEUS: "The Nebechanezzer is out of commission for at least a month. But,
TRINITY: "Let me guess. Weve been ordered back out anyway."
MORPHEUS: "Yes. This is another special op. Im in command, Niobe and Trinity

MORPHEUS: "Youve been assigned to this mission because youre the best, Choi."
DUJOUR: "Yeah, and headquarters thinks you might be able to whine the agents
CHOI: "Oh my God thats so funny. My point is, dont we need some r-and-r? Unwind a little? We lost two crew on the last one, you lost like five,
MORPHEUS: "You dont have to go, Choi. Volunteers only."
TRINITY: "Hes got a point, M. I have faith, but why so quick?"
MORPHEUS: "We have a chance, here, but the window of opportunity is brief. Our ships say the Matrix is already upgrading and re-coding to block our
CHOI: "Fuck. Every fucking time we get another one, this is what they do."
MORPHEUS: "He is the One."
DUJOUR: "You havent lost the faith, have you Choi?" CHOI grabs a half-filled rum glass and swigs it down.
CHOI: "Well, these are the times that try mens souls. Heres to victory."
MORPHEUS: "Power up. Sleep mode."
CHOI: "Aye aye, capitano."
NEO: "Ka equals 9. But reverse Ka is point-nine, right?
RAZOR: "You catch on quick, man."
NEO: "I know these symbols from the hacking trainer. But how come its so
TRINITY: "Your brain knows what to do. But it has to associate characters with

NEO: "Holy shit. How many calculations per second?"
RAZOR: "How many CPS? Well, thats kind of hard to estimate. Put it this way:

NEO: "Like reality."
TRINITY: "Almost. Reality is unalterable. But the fabric of reality in the affects on the Matrix are deeper than average. They have learned to change it according to their needs. But they dont have total control. Thats why we need operators like Razor here. But you, you go further
NEO: RAZOR stands and taps Neos skull. He stretches, grabs a Japanese style wooden sword, and, out of boredom, starts performing slow, precise Kendo moves around the main deck as he talks.
RAZOR: "The equipment you carry up here. Youre a freak. A good freak. Youre

TRINITY: "Not just you. Morpheus, myself. We were all born inside.
NEO: "Well, what separates us from others?"
TRINITY: "For the past 50 years or so, something has been happening to children RAZOR looks up to see MORPHEUS, hanging back as he listens. He comes

MORPHEUS: "Discussing history, are we?"
RAZOR: "Im trying to teach this fool some programming, man. Hes stuck in
MORPHEUS: "In the Matrix, without him, were helpless."
TRINITY: "Morpheus, can you tell us what the mission is now?"
MORPHEUS: "Not until we reach broadcast depth. Its slow going out there. I guess they know were coming back, so theyre patrolling. We have time
NEO: TRINITY grins slightly and pulls on his arm. There is only enough room for one on the end of the rock, so he sits down behind her.
TRINITY: "Dont lose your balance."
NEO: "It doesnt matter if I do."
TRINITY: "So, you can fly."
NEO: "Do you think I can?"
TRINITY: "Do you think I can?"
NEO: "I think you can do anything you want, if you believe."
TRINITY: "Like you?"
NEO: "I dont know. I dont know exactly what I can do."
TRINITY: "Will you teach me to fly?"
NEO: "I dont know if I can."
TRINITY: "Free your mind of doubt."
TRINITY: "In this construct program, the ground can kill."
NEO: "I wont let you fall. Ever."
NEO: "Its not real, Trinity. Youre not standing there. Step out. I can do With one last glance at the infinite drop, she steadies herself and stares straight into his eyes. Blue meet brown. Breathless, she steps straight out. She takes one step in the air. For a breathless second, as she steps off the edge, she is stable. When she takes her foot off the edge, though, she sways, and her foot slips, as though shes on a greasy surface bobbing up and down. She corrects herself, tries another step, sags further.
TRINITY: SHE glances down, then locks eyes with NEO. Then drops like an anvil.
NEO: HE dives down, shooting like a missile. TRINITY is calm, falling backwards, watching NEO come for her. The rocky ground looms behind her. She makes no effort to reach for NEO as he draws close to her. HE reaches for her with all his might.
NEO: "Grab me!"
NEO: "Grab on to me!"
NEO: "What the hell were you doing?"
TRINITY: "Showing you, Neo."
NEO: "Showing me what? You nearly gave me a heart attack."
TRINITY: "I want you to know how much faith I have in you."
NEO: "Oh. And this requires acts of insanity?"
NEO: "Only when Im plugged in."
NEO: TRINITY looks at him, then up at the sky.
TRINITY: "Its not you. Just, not here." NEO doesnt understand. TRINITY rolls her eyes.
TRINITY: "Theyre watching us, you big dope. Do you know how horny computer
TRINITY: "Over here."
RAZOR: "So romantic."
CIRCA: "Im sure Mary Palmer will appreciate your mood more than I."
AGENT JONES: "Our defeat is worrisome."
AGENT BROWN: "As is the loss of our colleague."
JONES: "We cant defeat them. You saw what happened."

SMITH: "Ill make it possible." The feat is IMPOSSIBLE.
CHANDRA: "Greg, are you fucking crazy?"
GREG: "Yes. But dont worry."
COP: "Holy shit. Drunk ass punks."
GREGORY: "Oh boy. Stop, stop, lets have some fun."
COP: "Holy shit!"
COP: "What the hell are you doing?"
GREGORY: "Well tell you when to stop, little man. Not the other way around."
COP: HE DIVES back into his cruiser, reaching for the radio. GREGORY pulls a huge silver .44 from his jacket and FIRES. The cruisers antenna is blown off at the base, and the nine-foot whip flips onto the ground with a metallic clang.
GREGORY: "Dont try anything stupid, man. I gotta bead on your donut-eating EXT. CRUISER
COP: "Whaddya want with me?"
GREGORY: "I dont know. I just thought Id find out what you wanted without you THE COP is a tough one. Far taller than GREGORY, muscular and serious.
COP: "Youre all under arrest."
GREGORY: "This is your lucky day, officer. Were gonna give you a night off." CHANDRA walks up to him. Seductively, she hands him the bottle of hard WHEN he pauses, GREGORY places the gun against his temple. Reluctantly, the big cop starts to gulp down the alcohol. GREGORY lowers the gun. He and CHANDRA return to their motorcycle.

CHANDRA: "Any one. It doesnt matter."
CHANDRA: "How do you do it, Gregory?"
GREGORY: "I dont know. Sometimes it feels like. Im reaching beyond the HIS hand drops and his head turns. He sits up, startled by something.
CHANDRA: "What is it?"
GREGORY: "They found us. Cant you hear it?"
CHANDRA: "What? I dont hear anything."
GREGORY: "We can only rebel so long. We can only push until they will hit CU on GREGORY. In the distance, the faintest sound of a helicopter can
CHANDRA: "They? The Men in Black?"
GREGORY: "Fuck! Get to the bikes."
GREGORY: "Wake up! Get on your bikes and fucking ride!" "THIS IS THE POLICE, STOP YOUR VEHICLES AND SURRENDER!"
CHOPPER LOUDSPEAKER: "THIS IS THE POLICE, STOP YOUR VEHICLES AND SURRENDER!" SUDDENLY, automatic fire sparks from the unseen helicopters. A bullet trail stitches its way across a pair of bikers, sending them to the ground as the helicopters fly overhead. GREGORY cranks down on the throttle and his bike explodes ahead.
CHANDRA: "Theyre gone!"
GREGORY: "Cant see shit." "Split up, into the desert, go!"
GREGORY: "Split up, into the desert, go!"
LIEUTENANT: "Sir, should we pursue?"
AGENT BROWN: "Withdraw your men and pursue the others. We have our own plans for

RAZOR: "Holy shit."
CHOI: "What? Tell me you got signal."
CHOI: "Are you using the right pulse wave?"
RAZOR: "Shut the fuck up and get back here."
CHOI: "Oh my God. What are they - "
RAZOR: "Theyre changing the Matrix."
CHOI: "Call Morpheus."
MORPHEUS: "Im here."
RAZOR: "Sir, you gotta get down here."
MORPHEUS: "Proximity alarm?"
RAZOR: "The Matrix, sir. The coding is going nuts."
MORPHEUS: "Be right there."
MORPHEUS: "It sounds bad. Theyre readjusting quicker than we thought."
NIOBE: "It appears that they are learning their lessons."
MORPHEUS: "It appears that they are learning their lessons."
MORPHEUS: "Tell Neo? About his predecessors, I suppose?"
MORPHEUS: "He is the -" NIOBE puts a finger to his lips.
NIOBE: "Six came before him, Morpheus." MORPHEUS shakes his head slowly.
MORPHEUS: "To me, none came before him. The Oracle told me I would find the one.
NIOBE: "What if they toughen the Matrix code, like last time?"
MORPHEUS: "There are lots of ifs. How about this one: What if we lose faith in INT. MAIN BRIDGE
MORPHEUS: "Talk to me."
RAZOR: "Not good, boss, I gotta compile a new descrambler."
MORPHEUS: "Do it. Were at broadcast depth?"

CHOI: "The mainframe? Haha. Its a joke, right Morpheus? Is today April 1^st
NIOBE: "Its not a joke. We have The One. We must do it now."
RAZOR: "But theyre altering the code already. I cant even read it yet."
MORPHEUS: "We have our mission, but its up to us to interperate how well do "Morpheus, theres more ice in front of that mainframe than there is
RAZOR: "Morpheus, theres more ice in front of that mainframe than there is
MORPHEUS: "You havent seen The One in action." RAZOR looks dubious, and turns to the screens.
MORPHEUS: "Can you hack in?"
RAZOR: "Getting you in is no problem. Maintaining the input/output and helping you is the problem. Thats how they killed savior number four, if I remember right. They cut the signal and trapped him in there." MORPHEUS spins the chair, then stops it. Their faces are inches apart.
MORPHEUS: "We dont speak of the past."
RAZOR: "Excuse me for dragging up painful memories, sir."
MORPHEUS: "Morning. Niobe, wake the rest of the crew. Razor, whats the ETA for
RAZOR: "I dunno. Just gimme an hour, Ill probably have caught up to them."
MORPHEUS: "Come with me."
GREGORY POV: He stars at the horizon and the mirages of water reflecting the jaundiced yellow sky. In the shimmering distance, a man appears, but Gregorys lids shut and we see darkness. When he reopens them, the figure is more clear. Its a man, dressed in a black suit. Even in the distance we can recognize him. We want it to be him.
GREGORY: "Oh my God. Its. The Man."
GREGORY: "What for?"
GREGORY: "Its too late. Were dead."
AGENT SMITH: "Do you want to live?"
GREGORY: "What for?"
AGENT SMITH: "A better life for all. Life for her. And for you, a chance for AGENT SMITH grins. He turns away, and the desert landscape before them turns into a soothing, cool, crystal forest lake. Smith takes a step toward it, then turns and extends his hand.
AGENT SMITH: GREGORY is mystified. Speechless, he drags himself to his feet, hoisting Chandra, and steps toward the lake.
GREGORY: "This cant be real."
AGENT SMITH: "You this, dont you?"
GREGORY: AGENT SMITH "Will you help us?"
AGENT SMITH: "Will you help us?"
GREGORY: CU: SMITH extends his hand. GREGORY grasps it. He lets go, and collapses into the cool shallow waters of the lake edge.
GREGORY: "Who the fuck are you?" SMITH grins devilishly.
AGENT SMITH: "Im nobody. A Smith. Whats more important, is you. We need you, GREGORY stares. He pulls CHANDRA ashore and stands to look AGENT SMITH in the eyes.
GREGORY: "First you try to kill me. Now you need me."
AGENT SMITH: "Two years ago, Gregory, your parents were killed in a terrorist
GREGORY: "So what?"
AGENT SMITH: "The terrorists were led by a certain individual."
GREGORY: "I know who it was."
AGENT SMITH: "We need you to kill him."
GREGORY: "What a bunch of bullshit. The whole government cant kill him, so how
AGENT SMITH: "No one in the government can do what you can."
GREGORY: "Fuck you."
AGENT SMITH: "I believe we have a deal."
GREGORY: "What are you gonna do, little man? You looking for a trip to the fucking hospital? Fuck with me and youll be looking for some plastic SMITH delivers a chest punch that sends GREGORY sailing back twenty feet. He tumbles to a stop, coughs, and stares in disbelief at SMITH, standing calmly at what seems like an impossible distance away. CU: SMITH. HE removes his glasses calmly. CU: GREGORY. He was stunned, but hes not out of the fight. Not by a long shot.
GREGORY: "No man can beat me."
SMITH: "Bring it on, pussy." Pull back as he CHARGES SMITH
GREGORY: "Mother fucker, what the fu -?"
SMITH: "Ready to change your mind?"
SMITH: "I can teach you to beat me, you know."
SMITH: "Help us, and both you and her will be free afterward." GREGORY stares at the ground, then gazes past SMITH at CHANDRA. Finally, he starts to rise. SMITH offers a hand, and GREGORY takes it.
SMITH: "You know it, dont you? That theres more to your world than what you
GREGORY: "Im going to teach you how to use the powers you cant even imagine. SMITH puts his hand to his earpiece. GREGORYS eyes close and his body SPASMS. He falls to the ground, breathless, and when his eyes open, he stares up at SMITH.

GREGORY: I know Kung-Fu."
MORPHEUS: "Were deep in their territory."
NEO: "I see that."
MORPHEUS: "Are you rested?"
NEO: "You know now, that you had predecessors."
MORPHEUS: "You know now, that you had predecessors."
NEO: "Yes. Ive heard things."
MORPHEUS: "What types of things?"
NEO: "That there were others, like me, who you thought were going to be
MORPHEUS: "Its true. There were others. And I didnt tell you right away.
MORPHEUS: "Does this anger you?"
NEO: "I dont know yet. So much has happened so fast, that I cant decide whether or not Im angry, or dissappointed, or even if I should be."
MORPHEUS: "You shouldnt be, Neo. You are the key in the Oracles prophecy.

MORPHEUS: "The Metacortex building."

CHOI: "What, by power of will?"
CHOI: "Hes joking right?" MORPHEUS shakes his head.

NIOBE: "What is it?" MORPHEUS shakes his head.
MORPHEUS: "Whats going to happen? If this is it, right now? The end?"
NIOBE: "I cant even imagine."
HOMELESS: "Spare a quarter, buddy?" NEO shakes his head, but still stares.
NEO: "How bout a quarter mil?"
GREGORY: SMITH circles him.
SMITH: "Pain is only weakness leaving your body. When you are sufficiently
GREGORY: "Tell me about what is happening. Whats wrong with the world?"
SMITH: "Get up and fight."
SMITH: "The world is not for you." HE slaps, has it deflected, dodges a blow.
GREGORY: "What do you mean?"
SMITH: "Youre not human, Gregory. Thats why you dont fit in. Thats why
GREGORY: "What, am I from planet Krypton?"
SMITH: "Not quite. But as humans continue to evolve, some are developing abilities. I have them. Others in the Agency have them. And you have
SMITH: "We need you to stop the terror. We need you to save our world."
SMITH: "We need you, because youre better than me. Now push past your abilities. You can turn you imagination into reality. See your hands SMITH comes at him, and GREGORY responds. Their fists and kicks are a fast, then turn into a blur. GREGORY cant believe his own actions. SMITH misses a block, and GREGORY blows him backward with a chest SMITH, recovering, looks up. GREGORY looks around. CHANDRA is gone.
GREGORY: "Where is she?"
SMITH: GREGORY looks in the ball. Its a window to an apartment overlooking the city. Chandra is in bed, waking up.
SMITH: "She doesnt remember our encounter. Shes fine. Dont worry."
BROWN: "Hes back."
SMITH: "Ill be there. Execute the defense plan."
SMITH: "Come with me. But only watch. Youre not ready to engage in a fight
GREGORY: "Why not?"
SMITH: "Because if you havent defeated me yet, you wont defeat them."
NIOBE: "Hes doing it."
MORPHEUS: "I knew it."
CHOI: "It cant be this easy."
TRINITY: "Its not over yet."
REAL TIME: What remains of BROWN flies forward. CHOI helps TRINITY up and the retreat into the building and take cover under a window. Through the window, we see military trucks, filled with troops, charging down the street, toward the Metacortex plaza. After the trucks come rumbling, black-painted M1A2 ABRAMS tanks. A black APACHE HELICOPTER flies over the convoy. CHOI looks through the window as he reloads his hand cannon.
CHOI: "Holy fucking shit."
TRINITY: "Weve stirred up the hornets nest now."
PRIVATE: "This is impossible. Whats going on?"
SERGEANT: "Just keep him in your sites, soldier."
SMITH: "Open fire."
PILOT: "Fox One."
TANK COMMANDER: THE GUNNER pulls the trigger.
REAL TIME: THE TRACER stops in front of NEO, and out of the air the HEAT round
AGENT JONES: "The plan is not working."
AGENT SMITH: "No shit." AGENT BROWN enters the room.
AGENT BROWN: "What about your protégé?"
AGENT SMITH: "Hes not ready yet. Ill deal with this myself."
AGENT JONES: "You cant beat him."
AGENT SMITH: "Ive been altered. Im Smith, 2.0." AGENTS BROWN and JONES look at one another.
SMITH: "Kill the others. Ill take care of this."
RAZOR: HE hits something on the keypad.
RAZOR: "Theyre about to pull something. Processing power is pouring into the agent programs and theyre locking onto your 3-D grid displacements.
MORPHEUS: "Send through ghosts to confuse their lock."
RAZOR: "Got it."
NEO: "Youre back."
NEO: "And you have a ponytail now."
"HEY!": NEO turns, and SMITH pushes him hard in the opposite direction to THREE SMITHS! They attack at once, one going low and hard with a knee breaking sweep kick, the other punching NEO in the face, and the third breaking to the side and putting his toe into NEOs stomach with a vicious side-kick. They attack is in perfect synch, eight arms and eight legs working like clockwork, striking their target without getting in the way of each other. The attack slams NEO back, right into the first, bloodied SMITH. NEO slams into his shoving arms, and stops as though he backed into a brick wall. AGENT SMITH grabs him and holds him in a FULL NELSON, exposing him to his three copies. The copies shift position and attack again. Two stand together, left shoulder to right, and with their combined arms slam NEO in the face, then step apart as the third comes in. The THIRD grabs the shoulders of the other two and flips, walking his loafers up NEOs body, and kicking him from below, right up into the chin of his jaw! It snaps NEOs back with a spray of EXT. ROOFTOP MORPHEUS and NIOBE stare on as the fight rages. MORPHEUS grips the edge of the brick wall edge. The stone crumbles under the tension.
MORPHEUS: "We can only watch."
RAZOR: "Four fucking agents, no wonder so much processing power is devoted to EXT. ROOF A BIRD flying by NIOBE and MORPHEUS slows its flight, slows its flapping, and freezes. CU: MORPHEUS. A pink lightning bolt freezes as it streaks across the sky, sealing the worlds light in an a light rouge.
RAZOR: "No goddamned way." His headphone chimes.
RAZOR: EXT. ROOF
MORPHEUS: "What the hells going on?"
RAZOR: "Theyre putting all the coppertops to sleep. They froze the Matrix."
MORPHEUS: "All processing power is being re-diverted to the agent program."
RAZOR: "All processing power is being re-diverted to the agent program."
NIOBE: "Morpheus, look!"
SMITH: "NEO, leave the Matrix. You know not what youre doing."
NEO: "Well, is that right?"
NEO: REALITY SHIMMERS as his anger strikes out at the building. The tops floors burn, and then explode. The explosion rips down the building, slowing, slowing, then stopping. THOUSANDS of SMITHS are gazing up at the building, concentrating on combating NEOs attack.
RAZOR: "Theyre hitting your ghosts." MASSIVE attack of STATIC bursts on the line.
RAZOR: "What the - " THE LINE goes dead.
RAZOR: "Theyre cutting comes, get to the access point on Laxe - " MORPHEUS signals to NIOBE. They exit the roof as he dials TRINITY
TRINITY: "What about Neo?"
TRINITY: "Is it clear?"
MORPHEUS: "I smell an ambush."
NIOBE: "Me too. Too quiet." CHOI grips his gun and grimaces.
CHOI: "Too quiet? The world is frozen. Ill go first."
NEO: "Morpheus, pick up."
MORPHEUS: CHOI checks his ammo and puts his guns under his coat. There are lots of people on the streets now. Everyones in shock over what happened, and the columns of smoke rising from the center of the city.
CHOI: "And remember, kids, when youre in a war, never volunteer yourself!" HE walks out onto the street, eyeing the phone booth and everything else. A gorgeous Asian businesswoman stumbles into him. Recognition lights up her face and she stops him.
WOMAN: "Choi? Oh my God, I havent seen you for months." CHOI keeps looking around, making his way to the booth. "Sorry about that? What kind of an asshole are you?"
TRINITY: "Casanova just ran into an old flame."
WOMAN: "No. Fuck you, Choi, you just think you can come and go when you CHOI is ignoring her now, walking straight for the phone booth as she is having a fit. Tears are welling in her enraged face. "Choi, if you have one shred of decency, if you even care about me - " Inexplicably, CHOI hangs his trench coat on the side of the booth. Standing behind it, he reaches around with his arm, keeping the coat between his body and the phone. The WOMAN doesnt even notice the web of gun harnesses and what looks like a ton of ammunition covering the inside of the jacket.
WOMAN: " - youll tell me why you dont call, why you, you, what are you "The jacket stops fragmentation. Sometimes they bomb the phones. Kiss HE grabs her to him and thrusts his mouth onto hers.
CHOI: "The jacket stops fragmentation. Sometimes they bomb the phones. Kiss HE grabs her to him and thrusts his mouth onto hers.
CHOI: "You werent lucky."
CHOI: "You still want me to call you? Ha ha ha!"
MORPHEUS: "This way."
NIOBE: "Tanks, or agents?"
TRINITY: "Yeah, tanks a lot."
CHOI: "Yeah, tanks a lot."
MORPHEUS: "The garage, hurry!"
MORPHEUS: "Keep your foot on the gas. Heal thyself."
TRINITY: "Any luck?"
MORPHEUS: "None. Theyve killed city-wide comms."
TRINITY: "Then the agents are out of touch with each other."
MORPHEUS: "They cant track us, but that gives them more time to destroy our exits, and find the Neb. Well try the desert. Communications might be
TRINITY: "What about Niobe?"
MORPHEUS: "She knows to meet us there."
AGENT SMITH: GREGORY freezes, then bursts into questions.
GREGORY: "What the fuck just happened?"
SMITH: "We need you, Gregory. Will you help us stop this?"
GREGORY: "I can stop this?"
SMITH: "Alright. But how can I fight him?"
GREGORY: "Alright. But how can I fight him?"
SMITH: "I will give you the power you need."
PRIESTESS: HE turns and looks at her. She smiles, but as Neo looks at her, a flash of uncertainty, and maybe hate, flies across her face before the smile returns.
PRIESTESS: "The Oracle is anxious to see you."
NEO: "I was on to you the whole time. I only came in here to isolate you,
AGENT JONES: "What are you waiting for?"
NEO: "I realized, that I cant destroy you - "
NEO: " - without destroying the Matrix itself."
SMITH: "You killed me too easy last time."
BROWN: "And if you kill us - "
BROWN: "Well only come back like him."
NEO: "I know."
SMITH: "So, why dont you take it all down?"
NEO: "The Matrix?"
SMITH: "I can. But if I destroy the Matrix, everyone within it will die."
NEO: "I can. But if I destroy the Matrix, everyone within it will die."
SMITH: "I take it the great Morpheus failed to mention this?" NEO looks up at him, but his expression doesnt change.
NEO: "How many people are in it?"
SMITH: "Six and a half billion."
BROWN: "Could you destroy us?"
NEO: "I could."
SMITH: "What does that make you feel like? God?"
JONES: "This is getting tiresome. Where do we go from here?"
NEO: "IF you cut the power that the Matrix supplies to your armies, Ill
SMITH: "Idiot. We dont care about life, we care about victory."
NEO: "So our kind. prevails."
JONES: "So our kind. prevails."
NEO: "You mean, lives."
SMITH: "Who do you think started this war, boy? Your kind tried to kill us
BROWN: "But you didnt. Youre not as tough as you think."
NEO: "Well see." NEO holds up a hand.
NEO: "Stop! I dont want to fight you! Youre human!"
GREGORY: "Holy shit!"
RAZOR: MORPHEUS ( O.S. ) "Good to hear youre still there."
RAZOR: "Jesus, you too. Where the fuck are you?"
MORPHEUS: "About two hundred miles east of the city, on highway 315. We need an
RAZOR: "Coming up on your left, ten miles, a rest stop."
MORPHEUS: "I dont remember an exit there."
RAZOR: "Gimme five minutes."
MORPHEUS: INT. MAIN DECK ( NIGHT ) RAZOR clears the screen in front of him and cracks his fingers. He looks at Circa.
CIRCA: "Theyre OK?"
RAZOR: "Gotta get em out. They need an exit program."
RAZOR: "Yes! Did you like that?" CIRCA just rolls her eyes.
RAZOR: "Exit ready sir."
MORPHEUS: "Check the phone for bombs."
CIRCA: "Its clear."
MORPHEUS: "Not a problem."
MORPHEUS: "I thought Razor said their were two cops."
RAZOR: "Fuck, fuck fuck!"
MORPHEUS: "Niobe, you first."
TRINITY: "Bullshit, its my turn."
NIOBE: "Junior ranks leave first."
MORPHEUS: "Get her out."
NIOBE: "Come on! Go through, Trinity! God damnit dont give up!" TRINITYS eyes flicker. She focuses on Niobe, summoning her consciousness enough to make the phase back into the real world. She starts to fade as we cut to:
CIRCA: "Youre safe, youre safe!"
RAZOR: "Crazy mothers!"
RAZOR: "Whats wrong with her?"
CIRCA: "Her bodys dying but her mind wont quit."
SMITH: "I should have killed you the first chance I had."
RAZOR: INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT RAZOR is strapped into one of the interface chairs, his eyes closed.
RAZOR: "Come on, tough guy, come got some Razor."
MORPHEUS: "Reload me."
CIRCA: "All right."
RAZOR: "Did you see that? We beat him! A fucking agent! He gave up!" MORPHEUS, unflappable, rises and rushes to the operations consoles.
MORPHEUS: "Where is Neo?"
CIRCA: "Havent heard from him. The city is still cut off from the rest of
MORPHEUS: "Why does it still exist? Why hasnt he destroyed it yet?"
RAZOR: "Maybe he cant." "Is he even alive? Is he captured?"
TRINITY: "Is he even alive? Is he captured?"
RAZOR: "Last we saw he was trying to blow up the building. Havent locked
MORPHEUS: "What? Why not?"
CIRCA: "Call me crazy, but I think hes masking his own displacement "His carrier signal just goes nowhere. But there is data going back MORPHEUS stares at the data on the screens. The Matrix lives. He pushes Razor out of the way, and starts hacking at the keyboard at an incredible rate. Its obvious Morpheus can handle computers.
RAZOR: "His carrier signal just goes nowhere. But there is data going back MORPHEUS stares at the data on the screens. The Matrix lives. He pushes Razor out of the way, and starts hacking at the keyboard at an incredible rate. Its obvious Morpheus can handle computers.
MORPHEUS: "I found him once. Ill find him again."
GREGORY: "So, you really dont have any idea how you got here?"
CHANDRA: "No. I only remember being on the bike."
GREGORY: "Yeah, you took a pretty good knock on the head. Do you know how we
CHANDRA: "Duh. We broke in. We dont own a penthouse."
GREGORY: "What if I said we did?"
CHANDRA: "Id say youre insane."
NEO: "Morpheus! Holy shit! You wont believe what happened."
MORPHEUS: "I know."
NEO: "I couldnt do it. Morpheus, theres a problem."
MORPHEUS: "Yes, there is a problem. The Matrix exists."
NEO: "I know. Im sorry."
NEO: "Uh, its impossible. If the Matrix is destroyed, the people within the system will die. They will all die. There has to be a different
NEO: "Morpheus? Did you know this?"
NEO: INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT MORPHEUS isnt happy about what he has to tell his protégé, but there is no bending his will. The others look on soberly.
MORPHEUS: "Neo, the Matrix. its not real. And its up to you to end it."
NEO: "No, Morpheus, this cant be! We cant do this! We have to get the
NEO: "Why me? Why the fuck do I have to do this?"
MORPHEUS: "You know what needs to be done. Time is short. Make up your mind. The only way youre getting out of the Matrix is through its destruction."
MORPHEUS: "No one goes in. Hes on his own."
