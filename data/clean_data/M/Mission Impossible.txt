KIEV: KASIMOV is sobbing. Uncontrollably. A MAN enters the room, ANATOLY, an imperious Russian in his forties, a Russian godfather. The THUGS and HOOKERS are ushered out. ANATOLY looks down at KASIMOV pitiously and urges him to go and sit by him in a chair he picks up for him. KASIMOV does as he is bid, looking gratefully up at ANATOLY. They speak in Russian which is subtitled.
ANATOLY: Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called I don't remember what happened! We were at the bar, drinking, laughing having
KASIMOV: ( sobbing ) I don't remember what happened! We were at the bar, drinking, laughing having
KASIMOV: I don't even know how I got here. I swear, Anatoly, I never touched her! I didn't lay a finger on her.
ANATOLY: Kasimov. Don't flounder.
JACK: Jesus, she's been under too long. Come on, come on!
KASIMOV: You're the only one who can help me.
ANATOLY: C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth.c'mon.
KASIMOV: They'll kill me.
ANATOLY: You asked for my help. You help.come on.
KASIMOV: You're right, of course.
JACK: The name pal.give us the name.
KASIMOV: The contact in Minsk..the contact in Minsk..works in a travel agency.
JACK: Come on!
ANATOLY: Come on!
KASIMOV: His name is...Dimitri Miediev.
ANATOLY: Dimitri Miediev.Dimitri Miediev.
JACK: Got him.
ANATOLY: Now, we drink.
KASIMOV: Yes, Anatoly, yes.
JACK: He drinks. He blinks. Something felt funny about that. Dizzied, KASIMOV swoons and passes out on the floor. ANATOLY moves to the closet door and opens it.
ETHAN: ( in English now ) Get rid of this scum. Did we get it?
CLAIRE: Did we get it?
ETHAN: We got it. On your feet.
CLAIRE: I want to sleep. Can I sleep here.
ETHAN: Walk, just walk. Start walking.
CLAIRE: I'm walking.
ETHAN: Talking's good, walking's better.
CLAIRE: Sleeping's better. with you?
CLAIRE: with you?
ETHAN: If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.
CLAIRE: Oh yeah? IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?! Just waiting for you, tubs.
JACK: She almost unconsciously slips the wedding ring onto her finger. ETHAN notices. He turns and SHOUTS to the room at He walks across the room and out the door. CLAIRE, worried, clutches her hands together, glancing down at her wedding We move in on it
ETHAN: She almost unconsciously slips the wedding ring onto her finger. ETHAN notices. He turns and SHOUTS to the room at He walks across the room and out the door. CLAIRE, worried, clutches her hands together, glancing down at her wedding We move in on it
ETHAN: IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?! Just waiting for you, tubs.
JACK: Just waiting for you, tubs.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Would you like to watch a movie Mr Rosen?
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: ( CONT'D )
PHELPS: No, I prefer the theatre. Would you consider the cinema of the Perhaps you'd choose one for me.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Would you consider the cinema of the Perhaps you'd choose one for me.
PHELPS: Perhaps you'd choose one for me.
KITTRIDGE: ( on the tape ) Good morning, Mr. Phelps. The man you're about to see is Aleksander Golitsyn
PRAGUE: INT. SAFE HOUSE - PRAGUE - DAY The IMF team's safe house is a sparsely furnished Prague apartment with a panoramic view of the city. The IMF team is scattered around the room. Sketches, pads, overfilled ashtrays and equipment are strewn everywhere. JACK and SARAH seated next to each other - JACK demonstrating the VISCO glasses to her. CLAIRE is seated opposite JACK at the computer. JIM and ETHAN are in the kitchen. HANNAH taking a roll of black-out curtain through the room.
JACK: Look to your right, then back to me. There's a camera built right into the bridge. Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here. Can you hear me?
SARAH: Of course I can hear you.
JACK: No, in your.ear piece. You have a lovely smile ( eyes ). Can you hear me Loud and clear.
SARAH: Loud and clear.
JACK: What's going on?
SARAH: I don't know.
JACK: Why don't you take a look?
SARAH: Jack.that's spying.
JACK: That's what we do isn't it?
SARAH: Jack you're so wicked.
JACK: Too wicked to have a drink later?
SARAH: I think I might just take that look.
ETHAN: Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more than ninety days leave coming.
PHELPS: A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want. After this one.
ETHAN: I thought I'd take some now.
PHELPS: ( quietly, to Ethan ) What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too.
ETHAN: Oh? What's the problem?
PHELPS: I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again. You were in Kiev. You tell me.
ETHAN: Tell you what?
PHELPS: When you started noticing your short term memory loss. What the problem was you and Claire had in Kiev?
ETHAN: What problem?
PHELPS: ( laughs ) Ah, God, forget it. What are we talking burnout here?
ETHAN: I guess.
PHELPS: Ethan, you
ETHAN: Why not?
PHELPS: Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out.
ETHAN: How was Chicago?
PHELPS: Wonderful. Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel. You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years? His wife's got a year old kid. So he says "All right. Who was it? My friend Harry?" She says no. "Oh, it was my friend Sammy." She says it wasn't Sammy. "Oh, I suppose it was my friend Lou." "No, what's the matter, don't you think I have any friends of my
SENATOR WALTZER: I'll go you one further. I say the CIA and all its shadow organizations have become irrelevant at best and unconstitutional at worst. It's time we throw a little light on the whole concept of the Pentagon's "black budget." These covert agency subgroups have confidential funding, they report to no one who are these people?! We were living in a democracy the last time I checked.
ETHAN: You're going to use Walter?
PHELPS: He's our guy.
ETHAN: Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
PHELPS: Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.
ETHAN: He won't be back in a hurry?
PHELPS: No, not in a hurry. What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
ETHAN: Sure. If the main character does.
PHELPS: If you were me, Ethan, who would trust to make him believable?
JACK: Sorry, am I interrupting?
ETHAN: JACK shows the gum to ETHAN.
JACK: Stick of gum. If you come up against a lock you can't pick
PHELPS: Are you gonna take it?
ETHAN: ( relenting ) Give me the God damn gum.
JACK: Just don't chew it.
PHELPS: Thank you.
PHELPS: Ethan. Jack's inside. Window's open by twenty-three hundred.
DIPLOMAT: How do you do, Senator, I'm Rand Housman, the Ambassador's aide. If I could just steer you through the reception line here
SARAH: I bet you don't remember me, do you, Senator?
SENATOR WALTZER: Of course I do. How are you, Miss
SARAH: He's in pocket. Under the archway behind me.
PHELPS: Sarah, mark the package and go to two.
SARAH: Your advance team mentioned you'd want a tour of the facility, so I've gone ahead and set that up for you
SENATOR WALTZER: Terrific. Let's get going. Will you excuse us?
DIPLOMAT: Uh, sir?
JACK: Great. Come on.
PHELPS: Hannah. He's marked. Lets go.
HANNAH: En route. Hannah, pull the shade ( or - Hannah go to night vision ).
JACK: Governor's in position. We have the elevator.
GUARD: Excuse me, can I help you?
SARAH: which leads directly to the Denied Area, the only limited access area in the whole facility.
ETHAN: named Jack. Not a reliable man, as I recall. Constantly late or behind in his
GUARD: Excuse me, let me see that ID again!
JACK: Relax your crack, Foghorn, I'm workin' on
THE LAPTOP: there's a split-screen of SARAH's thumbprint and the ID picture. JACK downloads her file into the security computer.
IDENTITY CONFIRMED: and the elevator doors slide open briskly. The GUARD, surprised, now catches sight of the SENATOR.
GUARD: Oh. Sorry, sir.
JACK: The drink ( date ) with Sarah is definitely
PHELPS: ( a touch of impatience ) Hannah I'm blind again. Hannah.
HANNAH: He's heading to the denied area.
ETHAN: ( to Sarah ) Higher. Higher.
SARAH: Right, right. Good.
ETHAN: Right, right. Good.
PHELPS: Get moving, Ethan. He's rolling to you.
ETHAN: Jack we're in position.
ETHAN: Jack. Jack.
JACK: I didn't touch it.
PHELPS: ( tension rising ) He's in the box, Ethan, he's in the box!
ETHAN: OK. Taking Golitsyn's exit. Jack, open the doors.
SARAH: What about my coat? I'll freeze.
PHELPS: Opening the doors. Go under.
ETHAN: He's got it. Saved your ass again Jack.
SARAH: Such a nice ass.
ETHAN: Sarah's reconsidering. Claire, transport in five minutes.
ETHAN: In position. Jack open the door, let the package roll.
ETHAN: Stairway, youíre wrapped, go to
HANNAH: En route.
JACK: and starts to rise. JACK looks down, into the elevator car, through the grate. Thereís no one in it.
PHELPS: Jack, what are you doing?!
JACK: Iím not doing anything! ( I donít have it either ).
PHELPS: I donít have it
JACK: Uh then I have a problem.
ETHAN: Cut the power. Cut the power Jack. Do you hear me.
ETHAN: Jack. Jack.
PHELPS: Man down. Stay where you are. Iím on my
PHELPS: En route.
SARAH: The package is in the open.
ETHAN: Jim. Jim. Heís in the open.
ETHAN: Can you lose him?
SARAH: Ethan. Heís out of pocket.
ETHAN: ( to Phelps ) Jim we canít.
ETHAN: INT. GETAWAY CAR - NIGHT Seated in the getaway car, CLAIRE listens to JIM and ETHAN
ETHAN: Sarah eye on the package. Jim, Iím coming to you.
SARAH: Jim gave an abort, we should walk No, weíre going to recover the disk, understand?! Now move!
ETHAN: No, weíre going to recover the disk, understand?! Now move!
ETHAN: About two hundred yards from the bridge.
THE MONITOR: PHELPSí point of view changes radically as his head swivels on the darkened bridge. He whirls again, looking over his shoulder and this time the barrel of a gun is visible, pointing at him and before PHELPS has a chance to react a GUNSHOT CRACKLES over the monitor. The point of view goes crazy for a moment, then over and down to a bloody hole in his own chest. His head rocks again, then goes over the side of the bridge and makes the long, hard fall into the river below.
ETHAN: EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - NIGHT He races up the rest of the stairs to the bridge but thereís no sign of PHELPS. ETHAN runs to the railing and looks down into the river but sees only dark, choppy waters below, now becoming obscured in the gathering fog. He turns and looks to the embankment. He can faintly see GOLITSYN, hurrying along the promenade. ETHAN gives chase.
JIM!: EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - NIGHT He races up the rest of the stairs to the bridge but thereís no sign of PHELPS. ETHAN runs to the railing and looks down into the river but sees only dark, choppy waters below, now becoming obscured in the gathering fog. He turns and looks to the embankment. He can faintly see GOLITSYN, hurrying along the promenade. ETHAN gives chase.
ETHAN: He watches the burning car in stunned silence for a moment, a stunned CROWD starts to gather. Remembering SARAH, he rushes down the stairs towards the EXT. EMBANKMENT - NIGHT SARAH comes out of the fog near the riverbank and sees GOLITSYN again, slowing down. A MAN comes out of the fog an seems to ask GOLITSYN for a light. SARAH draws closer. Behind her, the DRUNKEN COUPLE seems to be hanging with her for some reason.
CLAIRE!: He watches the burning car in stunned silence for a moment, a stunned CROWD starts to gather. Remembering SARAH, he rushes down the stairs towards the EXT. EMBANKMENT - NIGHT SARAH comes out of the fog near the riverbank and sees GOLITSYN again, slowing down. A MAN comes out of the fog an seems to ask GOLITSYN for a light. SARAH draws closer. Behind her, the DRUNKEN COUPLE seems to be hanging with her for some reason.
ANGLE: ETHAN races around the corner onto the embankment. He bursts out of the fog, just in time to see SARAH fall to her knees, over GOLITSYNís body. ETHAN sees the knife in her chest and
BEHIND ETHAN: The DRUNKEN COUPLE seem drunk no more. In fact, theyíre watching ETHAN. Through the fog and night, they see him leaning over SARAH, holding the knife in his hands.
ANGLE: A Prague police boat, SIREN wailing, arrives at the dock in front of the Embassy. The DRUNKEN MAN and WOMAN stop As THREE POLICE leap off the boat and race toward the explosion, ETHAN leaps over the gate and races up the alley and out of sight.
ETHAN: Central Europe. Unsecured.
ETHAN: Bravo Echo one one.
ETHAN: Go secure.
ETHAN: Theyíre dead.
ETHAN: My team. Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I donít know
ETHAN: They knew we were coming. Golitsynís dead too. The disk is gone.
ETHAN: Do you read me?
ETHAN: I donít think so.
ETHAN: KITTRIDGE ( O.S. )
ETHAN: Youíre in Prague?
ETHAN: No sir.
ETHAN'S POV: ETHAN walks in the glass front doors, right next to an enormous fish tank, part of the restaurant's exterior wall. He scans the clientele carefully maybe a dozen PATRONS are scattered around. EUGENE KITTRIDGE is seated at a table in the middle. He and ETHAN make eye contact. ETHAN walks to the table, a couple of quick, seemingly cursory glances around the room as he goes. KITTRIDGE has been working on a pretty good-sized lobster. He rises to greet ETHAN and they sit.
KITTRIDGE: I can't tell you how sorry I am. I know how much Jim in particular meant to you, Ethan. Personally as well as professionally.
ETHAN: He spots a stack of documents on the table. ETHAN picks them up. There's a Canadian picture bearing ETHAN photo and the name Phillipe Doucette, credit cards, driver's license, etc.
KITTRIDGE: Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley. Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects. Follow me?
ETHAN: Yeah. I follow you.
KITTRIDGE: We've lost enough agents for one night.
ETHAN: You mean You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, Who else is left?
KITTRIDGE: You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, Who else is left?
ETHAN: Who else is left?
KITTRIDGE: Yes. I see your point.
ETHAN: Why was there another team?
KITTRIDGE: Of IMF agents. At the Embassy. Tonight.
ETHAN: Of IMF agents. At the Embassy. Tonight.
KITTRIDGE: I don't quite follow you.
ETHAN: Let's see if you can follow me around this room. The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock.The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team. You're worried about me. You're right. Maybe this'll save some
KITTRIDGE: ( a tight little smile ) You're right. Maybe this'll save some
ETHAN: The arms dealer.
KITTRIDGE: That's right. Max, it seems, has two unique gifts a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314". The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
ETHAN: But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.
KITTRIDGE: Correct the actual list is safe at Langley. "Golitsyn" was a lightning rod, one of ours.
ETHAN: This whole operation was a molehunt.
KITTRIDGE: Yes, the mole's deep inside. And like you said. You survived.
ETHAN: How about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and I wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole.
ETHAN: Kitteridge, you've never seen me very ETHAN takes something from his jacket pocket. While KITTRIDGE talks, ETHAN unwraps whatever is in his hand.
KITTRIDGE: All right, enough is enough Hunt. You've bribed, cajoled, killed - and relied on intimate loyalties to get away with it. You're determined to shake hands with the devil and I'm going to make sure you do it in hell.
THE LAPTOP: JACK had been using lies closed at his abandoned desk. ETHAN wakes it up.
ETHAN: Job. Job 3:14. March fourteen. Job 31
ETHAN: Job three fourteen. Job It's Job!
BIBLE: The computer replies:
ETHAN: Max Goods tainted. Consider extremely hazardous. DO NOT USE. Fate will be that of kings and counsellors who built for themselves palaces now lying in ruins. Must meet to discuss a.s.a.p.
ANGLE: A rhythmic CRUNCHING sound and from the darkness on the other side of the room, PHELPS staggers toward him, wet and muddy, his middle a hopelessly bloody mess. He looks like he's dying on his feet. ETHAN freezes, appalled.
PHELPS: Ethan, what are you doing?
ANGLE: It's CLAIRE.
ETHAN: What are you doing here?!
CLAIRE: ( carefully ) Ethan Ethan, it's okay. It's Claire. Ethan what's wrong with you?
ETHAN: Don't move.
ETHAN: You were in the car!
CLAIRE: I wasn't. I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio. He said someone Shut up! I saw you. You were in the No, I got out of the car and I ran to the Don't give me that! I was on the bridge.
ETHAN: Shut up! I saw you. You were in the No, I got out of the car and I ran to the Don't give me that! I was on the bridge.
CLAIRE: No, I got out of the car and I ran to the Don't give me that! I was on the bridge.
ETHAN: Don't give me that! I was on the bridge.
CLAIRE: What happened to Jim?
ETHAN: There was nobody on the bridge.
CLAIRE: What happened to Jim?
ETHAN: Dead. Dead. Dead! Wake up, Claire! Jim's dead, they're dead. They're all
CLAIRE: ( mumbling ) They're dead. Jim's dead.
ETHAN: Take off your coat.
CLAIRE: Take off your God damn coat! Where were you?
ETHAN: Take off your God damn coat! Where were you?
CLAIRE: I walked away. He said abort. He was gone so I walked away.
ETHAN: That was four hours ago! Who sent you? Did they send you here?
CLAIRE: ( slowly ) Who is "they?"
ETHAN: Did they send you.Did they send you?
CLAIRE: Who is they, who is they? ETHAN grabs her by the wrists.
ETHAN: Who sent you?! Who sent you?
CLAIRE: ( screaming ) No one sent me! We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock !
CLAIRE: Why haven't they brought us in yet?
ETHAN: I've been disavowed. They think I killed Jim and everyone else. Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account. Kittridge assumes I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last two years, to get him our NOC list.
CLAIRE: What are you going to do?
ETHAN: I'm going to get it for him. Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me.
CLAIRE: Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do.
ETHAN: Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with
CLAIRE: The message is for Job.
ETHAN: I'm going to answer it.
ETHAN: Excuse me, could I trouble you for a
MATTHIAS: Would you remove your hat please?
ETHAN: You wish to meet Max? This is the price of admission.
MATTHIAS: You wish to meet Max? This is the price of admission.
ETHAN: I thought I was going to see Max.
MATTHIAS: You misunderstood. No one sees Max.
ETHAN: Then what am I doing here?
MATTHIAS: Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say.
ETHAN: I don't communicate very well through a If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud I'm willing to take the chance.
MATTHIAS: If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud I'm willing to take the chance.
ETHAN: I'm willing to take the chance.
MATTHIAS: Very well. Who are you and what are you doing here?
MAX: Who are you and what are you doing here?
ETHAN: I need one hundred thousand dollars.
MAX: Really? And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?
ETHAN: Why not? You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
MAX: The penny drops. Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone aggressive but playful. Job is not playful. So you're something of a That depends.
ETHAN: That depends.
MAX: On what?
ETHAN: Whether you like a paradox. I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
MAX: It's quite out of the question.
ETHAN: The disk Job sold you is worthless. It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.
MAX: And how might you know that? Are you another Company man?
ETHAN: Like Job?
MAX: Ah, but, we're asking about you.
ETHAN: I'm NOC. Was.
MAX: Why, may I ask?
ETHAN: That's the question I want to ask Job.
MAX: I don't know Job any more than he knows Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an Why should I?
ETHAN: Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an Why should I?
MAX: Why should I?
ETHAN: Because I can deliver the actual NOC list. The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location.
MAX: It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and see if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.
ETHAN: Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.
MAX: ( Pause. ) Mm - Hmmm.
ETHAN: Tell you what. How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
MAX: Very good.
ETHAN: Okay, use it. But I suggest pack up
ANGLE: MATTHIAS boots up. There's a little musical noise and the screen brightens. The computer WHIRS and CLICKS and a complex list of names, addresses, phone numbers and other personal information scrolls by. But Matthias is watching the digital read-out on the RF scanner.
MATTHIAS: Twenty-six, twenty-seven. So far so That's not so good for you, my friend.
MAX: That's not so good for you, my friend.
MATTHIAS: Thirty-two and change.
MAX: ( to Ethan ) Doesn't mean it's a signal. Could just be the hard drive heating up.
MATTHIAS: Forty-four. Forty-five.
ETHAN: I'd say you've got about two minutes.
MATTHIAS: Fifty-seven. Fifty-nine.
FEMALE IMF: ( in czech ) Switch it on. Keep cleaning.
KITTRIDGE: GOD D- Oh dear, Gunther will never let me use one of his apartments again. Phew, sorry I doubted you, dear boy. You're a good sport. Do accept the Thanks, Max. Or is it Maxine?
MAX: Oh dear, Gunther will never let me use one of his apartments again. Phew, sorry I doubted you, dear boy. You're a good sport. Do accept the Thanks, Max. Or is it Maxine?
ETHAN: Thanks, Max. Or is it Maxine?
MAX: I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession like a warm blanket. My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan. Obviously it didn't pass muster. Deal's off.
ETHAN: What was your deal with Job?
MAX: Six million dollars. I'll give you the same. But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe. I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous. I want the entire list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached. And one more thing your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.
ETHAN: U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached. And one more thing your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.
MAX: Done. Bring it to me in London. I want it by the end of the week.
ETHAN: How will you make sure Job will be there?
MAX: How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days? It's been a delight. Now where can I drop you dear boy?
ETHAN: I'm not being dropped anywhere without my
MAX: I'm going to have to front you personally. Don't lose that money without losing your life.
ETHAN: I wouldn't dream of it.
KITTRIDGE: The man's gone black, Barnes. He's under until he decides to surface.
BARNES: Look we can use someone from the Embassy and we can get the local authorities involved. Close off his transportation.
KITTRIDGE: What can we do, Barnes? Put a guy at the airport? How many identities do you think Hunt has? How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries? These guys are trained to be ghosts. We taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!
BARNES: So what do you suggest?
KITTRIDGE: Let's not waste time chasing him. Make him come to us. Everybodyís got pressure points. Find out something that's important to him personally and you Max made a deal with you?
CLAIRE: Max made a deal with you?
ETHAN: I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.
CLAIRE: We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself if I'm not dead, I'm with You're sure about this?
ETHAN: You're sure about this?
CLAIRE: Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him. ( ALT ) I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
ETHAN: We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
CLAIRE: What kind of help?
CATEGORY?: He types in a single word.
ETHAN: Simple game. Four players. Exfil opens the pocket cyber ops lifts the wallet.
KRIEGER: IMF mainframe.
ETHAN: IMF mainframe.
KRIEGER: ( after a moment ) Where exactly is it?
ETHAN: In Langley.
LUTHER: In Langley? The one in Virginia, Langley?
KRIEGER: ETHAN nods. KRIEGER turns to CLAIRE.
CLAIRE: If we're going to Virginia, why don't we drop by Fort Knox? I can fly a helicopter right in through the lobby and set it down inside the vault and it will be a hell of a lot easier than breaking into the God damn CIA.
KRIEGER: If we're going to Virginia, why don't we drop by Fort Knox? I can fly a helicopter right in through the lobby and set it down inside the vault and it will be a hell of a lot easier than breaking into the God damn CIA.
LUTHER: What are we downloading?
ETHAN: What kind?
LUTHER: What kind?
ETHAN: Payment on delivery.
CLAIRE: Payment on delivery.
LUTHER: I don't know. This I don't know.
ETHAN: This doesn't sound like the Luther Stickell I've heard of. What'd they used to call you? The Net Ranger? Phineas Phreak? The only man alive who actually hacked NATO Ghostcom.
LUTHER: There was never any physical evidence that I had anything to do with that.. With that exceptional piece of work.
ETHAN: You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.
LUTHER: You're all kidding yourselves. Even with top of the line crypto. Cray access. STU 3's
CLAIRE: Krieger can get it. May take a little time.
KRIEGER: May take a little time.
ETHAN: May take a little time. That's not what Claire tells me about you.
LUTHER: Thinking Machine laptops, I'm talking about the 686 prototypes with the artificial intelligence Risk chip
KRIEGER: Twenty-four hours.
LUTHER: And I get to keep the equipment when we're done.
ETHAN: Luther, I guess you're all out of I can't just hack my way inside. There's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone. I'd have to be physically at the terminal.
LUTHER: I can't just hack my way inside. There's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone. I'd have to be physically at the terminal.
ETHAN: Luther, relax, it's worse than you think. The terminal's in black vault lock-down.
LUTHER: And you really think we can do this.
ETHAN: May I come in?
CLAIRE: ( wary but interested )
ETHAN: It's cash. And a second passport. If anything goes wrong when we're inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation don't look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? Just walk away.
CLAIRE: You don't think we're going to make it.
ETHAN: I didn't say that.
CLAIRE: You didn't have to...
ETHAN: I just need you to be safe.
CLAIRE: What about you?
ETHAN: What about me - Jim called an abort - I didn't comply. I lost the team. I just need you to be safe.
CLAIRE: I wish I'd never laid eyes on you..
ETHAN: He rises and goes to the door. He's got his hand on the knob when CLAIRE wraps her arms around him from behind, turns him to her and kisses him, deeply. This time they sink slowly to the bed.
LANGLEY: INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - DAY KITTRIDGE, BARNES, and their STAFF are hard at work, photographs and biographical data of ETHAN on various computer and television screens around the room. KITTRIDGE leans back in his chair, staring at the ceiling.
BARNES: What I want to know is how Hunt accessed the disavowed file, even after we cut off his authorization code.
MAREK: He may have used Phelps' code. They were friends, and Phelps, was still valid for twenty-four hours.
BARNES: If that's the case, we need to implement a system to immediately deactivate an agent's code immediately. KITTRIDGE brings his chair legs down on the floor with a
KITTRIDGE: I can't believe what I'm listening to. Hunt just kicked us in the ass, you guys are standing here trying to figure out what kind of shoes he had on! I don't care how he did it, I want to know why he did it! Is he recruiting? For what
LOWDEN: The alarm get louder as it goes off in another part of the An AGENT is just coming in from the hallway.
KITTRIDGE: Too short sighted. This guy's proactive, he initiates. The question is what does he want now and where does he need to get it and Barnes what the hell is that
AGENT: Fire alarm, Gene.
KITTRIDGE: Oh, for do we have to evacuate?
BARNES: That's S.O.P..
KITTRIDGE: CUT TO:
ETHAN: ( to the Guard ) We picked up alarms in sectors three, seven, and twelve.
GUARD RICHARD: Yeah. That's what I've got too.
ETHAN: ( to the Guard ) What sector's the air conditioning?
GUARD RANDALL: Uh twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.
ETHAN: I gotta go in there and shut it down!
GUARD RANDALL: Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off.
ETHAN: Do you whole building?
GUARD RICHARD: ( reciting policy ) Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm did not go off
SERVICE.": One laptop serves as a Visco monitor, showing a video image in which LUTHER watches ETHAN'S point of view of the stubborn GUARD, who's finishing his sentence.
GUARD: ( on screen ) and it did not go off in twenty-one!
LUTHER: ( mouths ) Twenty-one, twenty-one
GUARD RANDALL: Wait! Hold it - it's on. Let's go.
ETHAN: Let's move!
LUTHER: Hi there.
GUARD: Air conditioning's through here!
CIA ANALYST: William Donloe.
GUARD: Where's the other guy?
ETHAN: Zero body count.
KRIEGER: ( a threat ) We'll see.
ETHAN: Time up.
ETHAN: 1 - 2 - 3 - Toast, toast. Luther, I'm going in. Don't disappoint me.Krieger, from here on in, absolute silence.
TECHNICIAN: Oh, God.
LUTHER: Type this password: AW96B6. Return. Go to the files menu, find the NOC list file. Open "NOC List." Put your diskette in. Double click on the NOC
LUTHER: Ok, good! It's scrolling. 0K, now we're going to download. Edit menu. Select "copy to disc". You're downloading. When it's all green it's done.
LUTHER: Holy mother of God.
LUTHER: You've done it. Eject it.
LUTHER: He's rolling. Get moving!
LUTHER: Get out of there get out of there
LUTHER: He's at the vault - get moving! 1 yellow, 2 yellows.Toast!
LUTHER: You're not
LUTHER: Phew! ( to himself ) NOC list.
KRIEGER: We're not outta here yet.
ETHAN: We're not outta here yet.
KITTRIDGE: mired in detail, open your minds, it's gotta be staring us in the face! What does Ethan Hunt want?!
BARNES: Same thing he wanted in Prague! Same thing he's always wanted! The NOC list!
KITTRIDGE: Now it's coming together in KITTRIDGE'S mind and a horrible thought occurs to him.
AGENT: It's for you.
KITTRIDGE: Kittridge, yup?
BARNES: What about him.?
KITTRIDGE: I want him manning a radar tower in Alaska by the end of the day. Just mail him his clothes.
LONDON: INT. LONDON SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT This barely furnished flat is as nondescript as the row of buildings it's in. ETHAN hurriedly digs through an overnight bag until he finds what he's looking for the now-battered bible he's used to contact Max. He flips through the pages and crosses the room to his laptop, which is powered up and waiting on the tiny desk. LUTHER, alone in a chair across the room. is seriously preoccupied. KRIEGER is sprawled-on a ratty sofa, hoisting a lager and watching CNN. CLAIRE is at the window staring out, anxious. KRIEGER glances over the back of the sofa at ETHAN.
KRIEGER: You contacting your buyer?
KRIEGER: You're not going to any meeting without me.
ETHAN: My contact is extremely shy.
KRIEGER: I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you? Not while I'm holding this.
CLAIRE: Stay out of this.
KRIEGER: Stay out of this.
OR: Lachez - moi
OR: Don't you mean this?
ETHAN: Don't you mean this?
KRIEGER: That's not it. That's not the list.
ETHAN: What's the matter, you don't know this
KRIEGER: ( fuming ) Where is it?
ETHAN: I thought you had it! Do you actually think I'd let you have the NOC list?
KRIEGER: Try any sleight-of-hand with my money and Iíll cut your throat.
CLAIRE: I'm so sorry. Krieger was my call. I've never worked with him. I'm sorry, Ethan.
ETHAN: We did what we had to do.
CLAIRE: I'm going to try and get some sleep.
ANGLE: ETHAN waits a moment, then casually walks to the trash can, picks up the disk KRIEGER threw out and brushes it off He replaces it, in the trash, with the blue disk from his jacket pocket.
LUTHER: Now I want you to hold onto it.
ETHAN: Now I want you to hold onto it.
LUTHER: What makes you trust me?
ETHAN: Because if you knew what you were getting into, you never would have done it.
LUTHER: I'm not letting this list get out in the Exactly, that's your job. Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open. What's the range of this thing?
ETHAN: Exactly, that's your job. Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open. What's the range of this thing?
LUTHER: It's hard to tell. I'm gonna have to be I'll get you close.
ETHAN: I'll get you close.
CLAIRE: Ethan I need to talk to you.
ANCHOR: The unlikely setting.a farm in the heartland of America.the State of Wisconsin, where federal agents claim to have broken the brain trust behind an international drug ring. For a report we go live now to CNN correspondent ( Joe Jones ) in the state capitol, Madison. ( Joe ).?
REPORTER: Authorities have identified the couple as Margaret Ethan Hunt and Donald Hunt.
REPORTER: Here they are now.
REPORTER: They were apprehended this morning by the DEA in a major sting operation for the illegal manufacture of the drug methcathinone, known on the street as Similar to methamphetamines, cat is seen by officials as one of the most powerful and dangerous drugs in the world. Some thirty-four cat labs have been seized so far, but the recently widowed Mrs. Hunt and her brother-in-law are believed to be involved in a global drug distribution
ETHAN: INSERT - SCREEN A public official exits the building. The reporter and other news crews charge up to him.
REPORTER: Mr. Fairchild, agent Fairchild, a comment
PUBLIC OFFICIAL: I think it's sad, really. Farmers, unless they're a conglomerate, are always operating on a paper-thin margin. I'm afraid what we have here is a case of a naive and lonely widow with a lot of financial problems who chose to make money through illegal means.
REPORTER: That was John Fairchild, the DEA agent in charge of this investigation. Officials tell me that international law enforcement agents are expected to arrive here later today to question the Hunts. This is Joe Jones, CNN, Love in Madison, Don't.don't touch me.
ETHAN: ETHAN switches TV off and paces away from it. His anger erupts and he kicks the old filing cabinets, then picks up a chair and throws it across the room so it smashes into the wall. CLAIRE tries to get hold of him, but he shakes her CAMERA SWING PANS between them.

ETHAN: Don't.don't touch me.
CLAIRE: What are you going to do?
ETHAN: ( turns to her and gestures at TV ) He's expecting my call. ( strides to door ) I'm going to the station. ( o/s at door ) And I'm going to call him.
KITTRIDGE: ( picking up ) I see you've been out visiting the folks.
KITTRIDGE: ( covers receiver ) It's Hunt. What do you need for a ( to Ethan ) Been watching a little T.V., have you?
ETHAN: Hauling Mom off to jail in shackles was an especially nice touch.
TECHNICIAN: He's in England. Get MI5.
KITTRIDGE: ( covering receiver ) Get MI5.
KITTRIDGE: Ethan, I want to reassure you that my first order of business after you come in is to get these ridiculous charges against your family dropped and eliminated completely from their files. Come in now, we can plea down the charges against you as well.
KITTRIDGE: Certainly Ethan.
ETHAN: If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
KITTRIDGE: I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
BARNES: Lost him. We needed three more seconds.
KITTRIDGE: He wanted us to know he was in London.
PHELPS: You're a hard man to catch up with.
PHELPS: ..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases.
ETHAN: - and picked us up in the States -
PHELPS: - but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
ETHAN: Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
PHELPS: - so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England..it was easy.
ETHAN: You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Hey, I showed 'em to you!
PHELPS: Hey, I showed 'em to you!
ETHAN: I remember..
ETHAN: Jim, who do you think you're kidding? A doctor's gotta look at that. You can't sit up straight.
PHELPS: I can sit up straight. I just can't..sit up straight very well. It's not important! I saw who shot me. Ethan, I saw the mole. It was Kittridge.
ETHAN: Kitteridge. Oh my god! Kittridge is the How did Kittridge do it?..
PHELPS: How did Kittridge do it?..
ETHAN: How did Kittridge do it?..
ETHAN VO: - first he took care of Jack in the elevator -
ETHAN VO: - he shot you on the bridge -
ETHAN VO: - he must have had back up take out Golitsyn and Sarah at the fence..
ETHAN VO: How did he do Hannah?
ETHAN VO: No. No. He could've taken out Hannah
ETHAN: Why, Jim?
PHELPS: ..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War. No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself. Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - without your permission. The son-of-a- bitch! How dare he? You realize itís over, youíre an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, youíve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year. Kittridge, weíll go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time!
ETHAN: We donít have to, Jim. Heíll come after Whatís going to make him do that?
PHELPS: Whatís going to make him do that?
ETHAN: What he didnít get in Prague. The NOC Jesus, Ethan. Good for you.
PHELPS: Jesus, Ethan. Good for you.
ETHAN: A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Tight security. No guns. Real plus.
PHELPS: Tight security. No guns. Real plus.
ETHAN: If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me. Iíll have Claire and Luther Stickell with me on the train. Marcel Krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in
ETHAN: I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking Iím dead and gone. God knows what sheís had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I..
PHELPS: I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking Iím dead and gone. God knows what sheís had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I..
PHELPS: - no. She canít know about me. No one can. Not til this is over. Thereís too much at stake, Ethan.
ETHAN: Youíre probably right.
PHELPS: I usually am.
ETHAN: Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash. Iíll call you from Paris.
PHELPS: You got it.
ETHAN: And get a doctor.
PHELPS: Good luck.
CLAIRE: What happened?
ETHAN: ( walks towards her ) I sent the message to Max. Weíre on for ( he steps towards her, stops ) Is this the only way?
CLAIRE: ( he steps towards her, stops ) Is this the only way?
ETHAN: ( he steps towards her, stops ) Is this the only way?
CLAIRE: Yes...come here..viens pres moi.
KITTRIDGE: ( to the Agent ) How long to the London Terminus?
AGENT: Twenty, twenty-five minutes.
KITTRIDGE: Youíve got ten.
MAX: How long until we reach the Chunnel?
MATTHIAS: Twenty minutes.
MATTHIAS: ( holds phone out for Max ) Itís him.
MAX: ( into phone ) This wasnít what we discussed.
MAX: ( back into phone ) Ha, dear boy! I do hope this doesnít prelude a meeting in private.
MAX: The possibility alone is worth ten million. Baggage car, rack 3. Silver briefcase. Combination 314.
MAX: I wouldnít worry about him. Once youíve got the money heíll find you.
BARNES: Only four more cars.
KITTRIDGE: And if we donít find him - weíll search the whole train again.
BARNES: Whatís Hunt doing on the TGV?
KITTRIDGE: High speed train. No-one gets on. No- one gets off. High security. Good place for a pass off to Max.
BARNES: But why tell us?
KITTRIDGE: Heís putting on a show, Barnes.
BARNES: What kind of show.
KITTRIDGE: I donít know. It didnít say on the tickets.
CLAIRE: Ethan.Kittridge is on the train.
ETHAN: Kittridge is Job. Max delivered. How far is he from Luther?
CLAIRE: Two cars. Where are you?
ETHAN: You are my eyes. Stay with him.
LIST COMPLETE: MAX dials a number on her cellular phone. She is calling Job.
MAX: ( into phone ) Heís in the baggage car.
MAX: Whatís the problem.
MATTHIAS: Connection denied.
MAX: Try it again.
MATTHIAS: Itís not working.
MAX: Is something wrong with the phone? Well is something wrong with the I always check the batteries.
MATTHIAS: I always check the batteries.
MAX: Run it through from the top.
BARNES: Nothing but civilians, Gene.
KITTRIDGE: This is bullshit - we donít even know what Max looks like.
BARNES: Maybe we donít have to know what he looks like. If heís got that list, heís going to want to check it. We should be looking for laptops.
KITTRIDGE: Good idea.
WAITER: Excuse me, Sir, your telephone.
MATTHIAS: Itís working.
MAX: Phew! Weíve got five minutes.
KITTRIDGE: Get this door open.
KITTRIDGE: Hello, Luther. Whereís Hunt?
LUTHER: Mr. Kittridge, the NOC list is being modemed off the train.
KITTRIDGE: INT. REAR CAR - MOVING - DAY CLAIRE enters a little breathless. Spotting PHELPíS profile in the darkened car.
CLAIRE: Ethanís right behind me. Listen to me Jim. Is it such a good idea to kill him? We take the money. Ethan takes the blame. No-one else has seen you alive. No-one will believe him.
ETHAN: Of course - Iím sorry to hear you say that Claire.
CLAIRE: Yes. Ethan Hunt, darling. Remember him?
PHELPS: Yes. Ethan Hunt, darling. Remember him?
CLAIRE: You knew about Jim?
PHELPS: Course he did. Just exactly when he knew is something of a question. Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan?
ETHAN: Before London. But after you took the Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago.
PHELPS: They stamped it, didnít they? Those damn
PHELPS: Two minutes til Krieger shows. Thisíll have to be quicker than Iíd like. Certainly quicker than youíd like.
CLAIRE: Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..
PHELPS: Why the masquerade? Why take the risk? Well, Claire, youíve asked the question and you are the answer.
ETHAN: I knew about Jim.
PHELPS: But, he didnít know about you. In all fairness, Ethan, Claire was never convinced her charms would work with you. But I was supremely confident - having tastes the goods. "Thou shall not covet thy Neighbourís wife", Ethan. Oh, Ethan is in love with you, Claire, make no mistake about it. And like all the worldís lovers, heís tortured by the same, one pathetic question - "does she feel the same way I do?"
PHELPS: Well Claire do you? Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.
CLAIRE: Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.
ETHAN: Youíve earned it.
PHELPS: Count it.
ETHAN: Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over Keep counting Claire.
PHELPS: Keep counting Claire.
CLAIRE: It was me. I did it.
PHELPS: All ten million.
CLAIRE: All ten million.
PHELPS: Fold it. Fold it tight.
ETHAN: Arenít you going to thank me Jim. Ten million is better than six.
PHELPS: Donít flatter yourself - six was for Eastern Europe. You made a lousy deal - ten for the world? What is that? But I needed you for the transfer with Max. I got a little extra change; and you got a little extra too.
PHELPS: Sorry Ethan. Times up. Say goodbye.
ETHAN: Youíre wrong about one thing. Iím not the only one whoís seen you alive.
KITTRIDGE: Good morning, Mr Phelps.
PHELPS: You son of a bitch.
CLAIRE: Donít Jim.
PHELPS: Now we donít have to eliminate him? You like that, donít you Claire? Donít you?
CLAIRE: Jim, itís over.
ETHAN: Jim, itís over.
PHELPS: Ethan - Iíve always taught you, nothing can be more dangerous than the truth. It can kill you.
ETHAN: This stuff is so sticky.
CLAIRE: This stuff is so sticky.
ETHAN: Itís all right, Ethan..youíll bring me back.wonít you.
CLAIRE: Itís all right, Ethan..youíll bring me back.wonít you.
ETHAN: I always have, Claire..
MAX: INT. REAR CAR/ENGINEER'S SECTION - DAY Another CONDUCTOR races into the power car, past his inert companion, and is shocked to see the copter right behind the train. He grabs a radio and SCREAMS into it.
CONDUCTOR: No, no, it's
CONDUCTOR: It'll crash into us! Accelerate,
ETHAN: Red light, green light. Asta Lasagna mother fucker.
LUTHER: I think this is what you're looking for.
MAX: My lawyers will have a field day with this. Entrapment, jurisdictional Maybe we'll just keep the courts out of this one.
KITTRIDGE: Maybe we'll just keep the courts out of this one.
MAX: I'm sure we can find something I have that you need.
KITTRIDGE: You know, I would
LUTHER: Reach your folks? How they feeling?
ETHAN: About what?
LUTHER: The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.
ETHAN: Well my Mother was a little confused about how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida keys.
LUTHER: ( Laughs and with a British accent )
ETHAN: Here's to you, Luther. ( clink glasses ) To being off the disavowed list.
LUTHER: Hey, I'm the flavour of the month!
ETHAN: You're more than that, Luther. They were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it. They want you back in.
LUTHER: Sure. They want me back in so I won't break in! They still can't figure out how we did it.
ETHAN: You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
LUTHER: I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and then, maybe, talk about it.
ETHAN: ( laughing ) It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
LUTHER: Why don't you come back with me?
ETHAN: Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
LUTHER: You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
ETHAN: He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough. ( looks up ) Gotta catch my flight..( rising ) So. How's it feel being a solid citizen Oh man.I don't know. I'm gonna miss being disreputable.
LUTHER: Oh man.I don't know. I'm gonna miss being disreputable.
ETHAN: Well, Luther - if it makes you feel any better I'll always think of you that way.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Would you like to watch a movie, Miss
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Excuse me, Mr. Hunt. Would you like to watch a movie.
ETHAN: No, thank you.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Would you consider the cinema of the
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Aruba, perhaps?
