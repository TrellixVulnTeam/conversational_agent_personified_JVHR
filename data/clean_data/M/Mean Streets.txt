He is very fond of the New Testament and often exchanges quotes from it with his friend TONY.

MICHAEL: I don't know that. That's what I'm telling you.
CHARLIE: Michael, believe me. You know the kid's a little crazy sometimes. I vouched for him and he'll come through. I promise. I'll talk to him and straighten him out. Don't worry, OK?
MICHAEL: ( SATISFIED ) DISSOLVE TO:
CHARLIE: What do you think? 'If a man have a hundred sheep, and one of them stray, will he not leave the ninety-nine in the mountains, and go in search of the one that has strayed? And if he happen to find it, amen I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety- nine that did not go astray. Even so, it is not the will of your Father in Heaven that a single one of these little ones should perish.'. Ok that's very nce but. TONY is now behind the bar near CHARLIE.

TONY then crosses to the other side of the room where he removes the blanket which has been covering a large cage. He reveals a live, young beautiful PANTHER stalking to and fro. The GIRL screams.
GIRL: I told you there was something in this room. The GIRL runs out. Everyone else except TONY, is backed up against the wall, frightened. The BOYS laugh nervously.
TONY: Keep quiet about this. I don't have any license for him yet. I've only had him a couple of days. Nobody can feed him except me. I'm the only one he trusts. Watch.
CHARLIE: Don't go to any trouble. We believe you. We believe you. TONY begins to open the cage. The BOYS are now standing on top of the nearest pieces of furniture.
TONY: ( ENTERING CAGE )
CHARLIE: Be careful. TONY ignores CHARLIE's warning as he crouches and allows the animal to wander onto his lap where upon he strokes the panther gently murmuring to him. The BOYS watch in silence.
CHARLIE: I'm surprised at you Tone. I mean you've had the place for over a year now. Nothing different.same old place.ordinary.flat.no TONY ignores CHARLIE's half-joking, drunken remarks.

GEORGE: We're closed.
BOY: I'm just waiting for Joey. The BOY walks over to a bar stool and sits down. Nobody acknowledges his presence. Suddenly the DRUNK on the bar stops singing and sits up, dazed. His sudden silence causes CHARLIE and the others to look up at him. The DRUNK stares ahead for a minute.
DRUNK: ( MUTTERS )
CHARLIE: Well, go ahead, whaddaya want? Someone to hold it for you? More laughter. Even the BOY at the bar laughs. The DRUNK rises, still smiling and stumbles off to the mens room. The Big Bopper - "Chantilly Lace" in playing on the soundtrack. CHARLIE is playing with a deck of cards.
CHARLIE: ( continuing previous conversation ) This place is dead. If I had a place.every night.lively. JOHNNY BOY is sipping his drink and ignoring the conversation.
CHARLIE: ( CONTINUING )
TONY: ( QUIETLY )
CHARLIE: Look who's talking. Pretentious bullshit. Who's the guy with William Blake and the tigers, eh?
JOHNNY BOY: Will you guys shut up with the witches and tigers.

CHARLIE: Michael, give us a lift.
MICHAEL: OK, get in. As they are getting into the car the two GAYS turn the corner. One of them, SAMMY, is very drunk and is crying hysterically. His companion BENTON is trying to calm him down when he notices MICHAEL.
BENTON: It is obvious that MICHAEL does not want to take them but he is also afraid of attracting any attention so he quickly ushers them into the car.
MICHAEL: Get in, get in.
CHARLIE: Oh Jesus Christ.what's this.
BENTON: Sammy get control of yourself.
JOHNNY BOY: Yes, you're gettin' it all over my Should I slap him?
CHARLIE: Should I slap him?
SAMMY: ( suddenly in control ) You wouldn't dare.
BENTON: I'm terribly sorry guys.It's just that he was terribly frightened.
MICHAEL: Just keep him quiet.
JOHNNY BOY: Friends of yours Michael.
MICHAEL: Shut up.
BENTON: ( sensing the hostility ) Oh.ah.I'm Benton and this is I can't get over the way he just kept going at him.

JOHNNY BOY: I don't think I should go home looking like this. You think I could stay at your place tonight? Your mother's not there is she?
CHARLIE: No, she isn't.
FLASHBACK: INT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT - DAY CHARLIE lives in a typical lower east side tenement apartment. Each room is painted a different pastel color. It is furnished in miscellaneous styles and from the pictures on the wall and various knick-knacks around the rooms it is evident that this is a family apartment rather than a bachelors pad. CHARLIE is helping his mother pack a suitcase. Through out the scene he is addressing her but she is never seen on CAMERA. The CAMERA PANS following his movements and CHARLIE directs his conversation always towards but above and beyond

JOHNNY BOY: OK.ok.I'm going.
JOHNNY BOY: Hey.you got nothing here.
CHARLIE: ( from the other room ) I could have told you that.
JOHNNY BOY: We'll get some food from my aunt's. I'll get in through the fire escape. She's always got something. JOHNNY BOY leaves the kitchen and walks towards the bedroom.
CHARLIE: Don't do that. You'll scare Teresa if you try to sneak in. JOHNNY BOY is now by the window looking out at the fire escape mischieviously.
JOHNNY BOY: Yeah.you're right. Maybe she'll have a seizure and we can watch. He laughs. CHARLIE hits JOHNNY BOY on the back of the head.
CHARLIE: That's not funny. You gonna be a jerk-off all your life. Grow up. You want something to eat from your aunt's house you go knock on her door, understand?
JOHNNY BOY: I'm not hungry anymore. I'm going to bed. JOHNNY BOY gets into bed. CHARLIE goes into the kitchen to get a glass of milk.
JOHNNY BOY: ( pretending to be angry ) Hello.fifth precinct? Yeah.I want to report a disturbance. Yeah this man and woman next door are disturbing the peace. They're keeping me awake all night now. What the hell is this. What? Well. yelling, fighting, throwing things. Uh-huh. If they don't kill each other soon I'm goin' over there and do the job myself. Yes - the address is 270 Mott street. I think it's apartment 2-r. Yeah, right. thanks. Look, I demand immediate action. Never mind my name I don't like getting involved in things like this.
TERESA: I'd like to eat something before I go back to work.
CHARLIE: Ok, we'll go for lunch.
TERESA: Do you have enough? CHARLIE checks his wallet.
CHARLIE: Well.with the hotel that's ten. She hands him a few bills. He hesitates.
TERESA: She hands him a few bills. He hesitates.
TERESA: Please take it.
CHARLIE: I don't mind. She puts the money into his hand.
TERESA: I don't mind. She puts the money into his hand.
CHARLIE: Sure.it's not that.I mean.
TERESA: ( touching his face ) It's all right.
CHARLIE: Well, if things go the way I hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself.
TERESA: An apartment uptown? Downtown?
CHARLIE: Maybe, who knows.
TERESA: ( SEARCHINGLY )
CHARLIE: Nobody knows anything, believe me. She kisses him gently.
CHARLIE: See if you can get your hands on some pamphlets on laws or by laws.or proprietorship.you know.at your place.
TERESA: Anything specific?
CHARLIE: You know.like restaurants, night What is it now?
TERESA: ( AFFECTIONATELY )
CHARLIE: Don't ask.
TERESA: Alright. Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?
CHARLIE: Did you?
TERESA: CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable. The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared. Not half as much as we were though.
CHARLIE: CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable. The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared. Not half as much as we were though.
TERESA: It doesn't make any sense. He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy.not unless it was personal.
CHARLIE: You missed the point. The kid's a climber.not very bright.but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation. He thinks he's in good It's still sick.
TERESA: It's still sick.
CHARLIE: Not sick.just stupid. Speaking of stupid, your cousin last night was feeling so good he decided to break into your mother's house.to get some food. TERESA laughs at this story but her mood changes suddenly.
TERESA: You're sure he doesn't know. He takes her in his arms.
CHARLIE: Don't worry.
CHARLIE: ( CONFESSION )
CHARLIE: ( CONTINUING )
CHARLIE: .'Oh God be merciful to me the sinner!' I'm not taking advantage of her. I swear to you that if she meets someone she'd like to marry. Back to CHARLIE in sync.
CHARLIE: ( CONTINUED )
CHARLIE: .pluck it out and cast it from thee." "Woe to the man through whom scandal does come." I'm sure you'd agree this is no time to get tied down. Like the priesthood.
CHARLIE: .they don't get tied down do they? "Have I not a right to do what I chose? Even so the last shall be first and the.
CHARLIE: .first last. For many are called but few are chosen."
OSCAR: ( with a slight Jewish accent ) Hey.you're here. They told me you're here.and you're here. How are you?
CHARLIE: Ok, how's everything going? OSCAR sits down next to CHARLIE.
OSCAR: Don't ask.do you have any idea what I've been doing all I was in the basement fixing the pipes. Would you believe that?
CHARLIE: I was in the basement fixing the pipes. Would you believe that?
OSCAR: I was in the basement fixing the pipes. Would you believe that?
CHARLIE: ( LAUGHING )
OSCAR: ( MIMICKING )
OSCAR: Look Charlie, you're a good boy. Will you just tell your uncle that I have nothing. There is nothing to give him. No envelopes with cash inside, no checks, nothing.
CHARLIE: That bad, huh?
OSCAR: I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
CHARLIE: Not next week's either.listen.you tell that to Giovanni, not me.
OSCAR: Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that. I don't need this aggravation. I'm getting old.
CHARLIE: He'd rather have the loan payed, you know that.
OSCAR: Your Uncle's a good man.I won't stick him. Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place. And tell me why should I care? I got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out.who disappears and leaves me with all the problems. I should go back to Florida.I don't need this.
CHARLIE: I don't understand, where's Groppi?
OSCAR: I should know? His wife don't even know. Probably off with one of his little girls.I don't know. I tell you, if he don't give a damn, then I don't give a damn.Why should I kill myself?
CHARLIE: My uncle figured that this week was bad.but about next week.I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him What can I say?
OSCAR: What can I say?
CHARLIE: ( to repair man ) Is my uncle back there? CHARLIE points in the direction of a doorway.
REPAIR MAN: Yeah, but I think he's busy now. Hey Charlie play 463 today - for CHARLIE walks through the luncheonette area, past the dining room where his uncle is in conference, to the bathroom at the very back of the cafe. MARIO is seated with his uncle. MARIO is forty five years old. He is GIOVANNI'S closest associate, brought into the organization in the traditional manner, making his early reputation through hits ( murders ). He is not very intelligent but has an undying loyalty to GIOVANNI, and is very fond of CHARLIE. MARIO and GIOVANNI are seated with a very old man. They are deep in their private conversation. CHARLIE passes by unnoticed and walks into the bathroom. CHARLIE begins to wash his hands but changes his mind. He shuts off the faucet in order to eavesdrop on the INT.

OLD MAN: ( in Italian with
GIOVANNI: Your son only did what was stupid. We have enough down here without something like that. And what for? .Nothing.no reason. Protect him? Why? I didn't tell him to do anything for me. He's going to Miami? Good.keep him in Miami for six months.a year.a good long time. After everything's forgotten then I see what I can do for him. Right now.keep him away.
CHARLIE: Marie, are there Columbian coffee beans in this coffee?
MARIE: I dunno.
CHARLIE: Just a second. Let me taste it. He pauses to sip the coffee, then shakes his head.
CHARLIE: Yes, I'd say there are some Columbian coffee beans in this coffee, but only about 39%. MARIE is disinterested. CHARLIE continues.
CHARLIE: You see. You probably don't notice this Marie, but Colombian coffee beans are rich coffee beans. Bursting with that good, deep coffee flavor. Picked when they are ripe to the point of perfection. The beans of course, are protected by the tall South American Guama MARIE chews her gum for a moment and leaves the table. CHARLIE'S monologue continues and gradually he falls back into his CONFESSION. As he talks, the CAMERA PICKS UP DETAILS of the cafe and the people in it.
CHARLIE: Then the bean pickers come down and pick each bean by hand. Bean by bean, all heavy with flavor. And they load them into boxes, one box at a time, box by box. From time to time CHARLIE is casually glancing at MARIE who is busy with her work.
CHARLIE: ( CONTINUED )
CHARLIE: Uncle, how are you feeling?
GIOVANNI: Fine. Did you have a good time last night?
CHARLIE: ( QUIETLY )
GIOVANNI: No you weren't. CHARLIE is struck silent for a moment. He listens.
CHARLIE: ( EMBARRASSED )
GIOVANNI: Yes, you did.
CHARLIE: About Oscar.I think he put on this act.about the restaurant being in bad shape and all that. He can't make the payments.I don't know what to make of it. He says Groppi's run off with a girl. I could help if you want.
GIOVANNI: No.his business is bad. But I'll decide what to do and you.and you just keep out of anything that might.might.er draw attention to you.
CHARLIE: Yes.I understand.I'll be careful.
TERESA: C'mon Charlie.one more day. I'll call in sick for work.
CHARLIE: No.we can come back in a couple of weeks. Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.
TERESA: CHARLIE picks up a copy of Henry James' Portrait of a Lady and tries to read it. He tosses it aside.
CHARLIE: A paper on that one too?
TERESA: A paper on that one too?
CHARLIE: Yeah.but don't worry about that now. The Hemmingway one is first.
TERESA: It was nothing. I'm almost finished.
CHARLIE: Take your time. I don't care.
TERESA: I know you don't. You've been very preoccupied lately.
CHARLIE: That's the word.preoccupied. CHARLIE turns towards TERESA and tries to kiss her. She playfully turns away. But CHARLIE quickly gets bored with that and doesn't pursue her. She is confused by his actions.
CHARLIE: Let's go back inside.
CHARLIE: See that.know who lives there? The name George Earhardt mean anything to you?
TERESA: Sure.He lives there?
CHARLIE: No. Of course he lives there. Would I point it out to you if he The house is seen from a great distance. CHARLIE'S VIEWPOINT. There is great activity.all with a very businesslike air.

CHARLIE: Uhuh.probably a good idea. Why don't you do it this time?
TERESA: You know why.with my parents.
CHARLIE: Well you can't blame them in a way.
TERESA: ( pulling away from him ) I can take care of myself. You know that.
CHARLIE: I know.I know. They embrace.

CHARLIE: .He must have heard the name from those T.V.'s in the hall that were blaring all the time. I remember GUEVARA was in town at the time. Must've heard it from there I guess.but that's funny, isn't it?
TERESA: Of all people. Now say the truth. Do I look like Che Guevara. C'mon. They laugh. He crosses to TERESA and they kiss.
CHARLIE: Of all people. Now say the truth. Do I look like Che Guevara. C'mon. They laugh. He crosses to TERESA and they kiss.

CHARLIE: You've been running round too much. Bet you've been forgetting your The green capsules in the top drawer. CHARLIE gets her the pills and heads out of the cottage for a walk.
TERESA: The green capsules in the top drawer. CHARLIE gets her the pills and heads out of the cottage for a walk.
FANTASY: EXT. ROADWAY IN FRONT OF COTTAGE - DAY CHARLIE walks directly to the front door of the cottage and rings the bell confidently. The door is opened immediately which startles him. From inside the house we see GROPPI'S back as he holds the door open. He is in a satin robe. We can see CHARLIE'S startled face through the partially opened At that moment a nude girl, her back to the CAMERA appears in the FOREGROUND. This startles CHARLIE even more.
GROPPI: What do you want kid? At that moment a nude girl, her back to the CAMERA appears in the FOREGROUND. This startles CHARLIE even more.
GROPPI: What do you want?...well?
CHARLIE: I.I'm selling encyclopedias.er a magazines.newspapers.I'm conducting a survey.I.
GROPPI: We don't want no fuckin' books! GROPPI slams the door in CHARLIE'S face.
REALITY: EXT. ROADWAY IN FRONT OF COTTAGE - DAY CHARLIE is still standing in front of the cottage. Suddenly a little boy of about nine appears.
BOY: There's nobody here mister. CHARLIE turns in surprise.
CHARLIE: Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?
BOY: Yeah. But he ain't here now.
CHARLIE: Know where he is?
BOY: Follow me. The BOY leads him towards a heavily overgrown treed area.
CHARLIE: How much farther? CHARLIE repeats this question periodically as he follows the BOY. Finally CHARLIE finds himself alone in the middle of a dense forest with the BOY nowhere in sight. He calls out but there is no answer. He realizes he's been had.
CHARLIE: ( CONFESSION )
CHARLIE: ( CONTINUED )
GIOVANNI: Play it again!!! Everyone laughs and joins in.

MICHAEL: Ok guys.have a heart. This is my EXT. NIGHT - IN FRONT OF MOVIE THEATER The boys are paying for their tickets.
CHARLIE: ( CONFESSION )
CHARLIE: ( VOICE OVER )
CHARLIE: ( continued voice over ) .the weeping and the gnashing of teeth'.or something like that. My talent's my brain too but I use my talent.I'm not saying that I'm a genius.You'll probably be the first one to agree on that, but I can tell the difference between the intelligent and the stupid. Take the army for example.
CHARLIE: ( continued voice over ) That's there and I'm here and that's the way it's going to stay!
TERESA: Oh sure! I know her Michael.In fact, I saw her a few days ago under a bridge in Jersey, making out with a nigger. MICHAEL grimaces in shock. He spits.
MICHAEL: You sure?.a nigger.Uh!.and I kissed her. He wipes his lips with his cape. The guest of honor, the young soldier is very drunk. He is attempting to open his going away presents, one of which turns out to be a carefully folded American flag. He attempts to open it with one great flourish. He fails however, knocking over the glasses on the table. The group Suddenly, the doorbell rings and everyone looks up. The door opens and CHARLIE appears, arms outstretched, dressed as the ressurected Christ - with white robes, fake beard and hair, and artificial wounds. His arms stretch out wider. The initial shock wears off and TONY greets him.
TONY: ( SMILING )
CHARLIE: I have come to create order. Scotch and water please. They all laugh. The rock music blares as CHARLIE walks to and fro blessing all in the room. TONY is delighted with the scene. CHARLIE sits at the kitchen table, TONY opposite him, and the others gather around. The party is getting noisier. TONY gives CHARLIE a glass of ice cubes. CHARLIE plays the part of a priest, during the Mass when the chalice is filled with wine and water, TONY pours the scotch over his fingers first. CHARLIE lifts his hands to touch the bottle as a priest would. He signifies that there is enough in the glass. TONY then repeats the same ritual with a bottle of soda-water.
CHARLIE: May God be with you.
TONY: 'And with your spirit.'
CHARLIE: ( gesturing with his drink ) Everyone drinks after repeating the toast. The crowd around them begins to break up as CHARLIE and TONY begin to have fun with each other. TONY pulls down his mask, revealing a skeleton death face which covers his own face except for his mouth. It completes the Dough-boy uniform quite well.
TONY: ( taking on the guise of an interviewer ) 'Art thou the King of the Jews'?
CHARLIE: 'Dost thou say this of thyself, or have others told thee of me?'
TONY: 'Am I a Jew? Thy own people and the chief priests have delivered thee to me. What hast thou done?' MICHAEL and a few of the others gather around again as they 'My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is my kingdom is not from here.'
CHARLIE: 'My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is my kingdom is not from here.'
TONY: 'Thou art then a king?'
CHARLIE: 'Thou sayest it; I am a king. This is why I was born and why I have come into this world, to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.' TONY leans over towards CHARLIE.
TONY: 'What is the truth?' The others around them give mock applause. TONY smiles and nods his head to them. CHARLIE laughs. They drink. Someone hits CHARLIE on the back of the head. CHARLIE startled, looks up.
TONY: Prophesy to us, oh Christ! Who is it that struck thee?
CHARLIE: I don't know, but God help him if he does it again! They all laugh.
CHARLIE: He said he'd be here.
MICHAEL: Well, he isn't. Nice.real nice.
CHARLIE: He'll be here. Look, take this for He hands MICHAEL a twenty dollar bill from under his robe.
MICHAEL: You kiddin. The way it is now this isn't even interest for two hours.
CHARLIE: ( putting the bill back into his pocket ) How much was the original loan again?
MICHAEL: $500. He borrowed that because he wanted to pay off his other loans. now, counting the interest.it's almost $3,000.
CHARLIE: $3,000. Shit! Can we hold it at
MICHAEL: Charlie, this is business.
CHARLIE: ( avoiding the issue ) 'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who I'll tell you who you can pray for. Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place.Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs.and I mean it.
MICHAEL: I'll tell you who you can pray for. Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place.Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs.and I mean it.
CHARLIE: ( in the same manner ) 'But I say to you not to resist the evildoer; on the contrary, if someone takes thy tunic, let him take thy cloak as well.to him who asks of thee, give; and from him who would borrow of thee do not turn away!
MICHAEL: ( EXASPERATED )
CHARLIE: ( more serious now ) 'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
MICHAEL: You said it. A loud scream is heard from the bathroom.
EVERYONE: Blasphemy!.The anti-Christ! Crucify him!! They drag CHARLIE into the next room where, amidst all the shouting and laughing, the other members of the party are placing firecrackers on model airplanes, simulating their own "dog fight". They are flying the planes out the open CHARLIE takes everything in stride trying to shout a few lines over their laughter.
CHARLIE: 'Father.forgive them.for they know not.what they do.' The doorbell rings and TONY answers it. It is TERESA and she looks very worried.
TERESA: Charlie.? Charlie here.?
TERESA: ( FRANTICALLY )
CHARLIE: Now don't get excited. Don't get It is very late and the streets are deserted. At the corner of the building in question, a few of JOHNNY BOY'S friends cling to the wall for safety. When they see CHARLIE and TERESA they call out.
FRIENDS: Charlie, stay there.He's crazy. He's got a 22. TERESA gets up against a wall. CHARLIE sends her down the block and she leaves reluctantly.
CHARLIE: Johnny it's me, Charlie. JOHNNY BOY can now be seen silhouetted against the moonlight on the tenement roof. He has a gun in his hand.
JOHNNY BOY: Don't come any closer!!!
CHARLIE: Cut it out stupid. It's me. JOHNNY BOY fires a shot into the air. CHARLIE clings to the wall with the others. A moment later he makes a quick run for the doorway of the building across the street. He enters the building that leads to the roof.
JOHNNY BOY: Charlie.pssst. Over here. He laughs with glee.
CHARLIE: What are you.crazy? He slaps JOHNNY BOY on the back of the head.
JOHNNY BOY: Hey.don't do that.I'm only scaring them.
CHARLIE: Stupid bastard.you get your cousin half-sick over this. The boys below are still clinging to the walls of the building. JOHNNY is oblivious to CHARLIE'S statement.
JOHNNY BOY: Watch this. He takes out a home made firecracker consisting of glass cigar tubing filled with gunpowder and a waxed fuse stick through the top layer of cork. He lights it.
CHARLIE: What the fuck. JOHNNY BOY tosses it over the building and it blows up in mid-air. The boys below rush madly away. Lights go on in the tenements around them. The explosion was quite loud.
CHARLIE: Let's get out of here.
JOHNNY BOY: ( LAUGHING )
JOHNNY BOY: I swear to God Charlie.my arm still hurts from the car accident.that's why I didn't go to work. I swear it.
CHARLIE: ( ANGRY )
JOHNNY BOY: I'm going to work this week.I mean it.
CHARLIE: It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now.the interest is going up.$3,000.do you realize that, flash?
JOHNNY BOY: I'm sorry Charlie.I didn't mean it.
CHARLIE: Big deal.in the meantime, it's done.I'll still try to help you out.You know that.but you gotta show some effort.some respect. Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
JOHNNY BOY: Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
CHARLIE: JOHNNY BOY ( COAXING )
JOHNNY BOY: ( COAXING )
CHARLIE: That'll help you out fine. That's the best way for you, not for me! I swear to God, I'll rip you open if my uncle ever hears a word about this. You understand? I don't care what happens, he doesn't find I don't get involved with anything, you understand that? Nothing! I'm clean as far as you know.right?
JOHNNY BOY: Yeah, take it easy. Will you relax.
CHARLIE: That's what I get for getting involved. Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok? This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him. If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something. understand? I'm not asking I'm telling you!!
JOHNNY BOY: I understand. JOHNNY BOY closes his eyes. CHARLIE looks at JOHNNY BOY and then looks at the cemetary in the moonlight. It seems totally apart from the city with the sirens and cars far in the distance. CHARLIE stands and unravels his robes, preparing to take them off. He projects the image of Christ delivering a sermon. Music and laughter in the distance catches his attention. The lights and the music are coming from the top floor of a tenement building where a Puerto Rican family is having a party. The sound echoes through the streets. Decorations are hanging and blowing away through the open windows. As CHARLIE watches a fight break out over one of the girls. Screams are heard. People run up and down the fire escape. CHARLIE has pulled off the robe. He now removes the beard and wig and has become himself again. He leans over to find JOHNNY BOY fast asleep on a tomb.
CHARLIE: 'Could you not, then, watch one hour with me?' He wakes JOHNNY BOY up.
CHARLIE: 'The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.'
OSCAR: Put the menus away. I, personally do the cooking tonight.
GIOVANNI: Fine.that's why I'm here.
MARIO: Capozelle, Calamari.anything you INT. OSCAR'S RESTAURANT - LATER IN THE MEAL OSCAR sits.
OSCAR: Capozelle, Calamari.anything you INT. OSCAR'S RESTAURANT - LATER IN THE MEAL OSCAR sits.
GIOVANNI: ( POURING WINE ) DISSOLVE TO:
OSCAR: Giovanni.er.can I talk? Refering to CHARLIE. GIOVANNI nods his head yes.
OSCAR: About the place, Giovanni.
GIOVANNI: .I know all about it. We'll discuss it later.
OSCAR: ( CONTINUING ) ( GOOD-NATUREDLY )
GIOVANNI: ( GOOD-NATUREDLY )
OSCAR: ( SOMEWHAT RELIEVED )
CHARLIE: I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?
GIOVANNI: Well, he was always a little crazy. he puts a gun in his .like your friend.comme si chiama.Henning? Heming?
CHARLIE: Hemmingway. Killed himself. I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
GIOVANNI: ( laughing to MARIO ) You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind.so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella.to read, so I read it.
CHARLIE: Wasn't a book.was a short story.
MARIO: What was it?
CHARLIE: ( EMBARRASSED )
MARIO: No, c'mon.Y'know, I read.
CHARLIE: ( MUTTERING )
MARIO: THE CONVERSATION IS NOW ENGLISH.
CHARLIE: ( SOFTLY )
MARIO: Oh yeah.didn't read it but I saw the movie.Gregory Peck.pretty Yeh, Mario over here, he reads a lot.
GIOVANNI: Yeh, Mario over here, he reads a lot.
GIOVANNI: I like this Harold Robbins.
MARIO: I like this Harold Robbins.
CHARLIE: ( POLITELY )
GIOVANNI: What I don't understand is why you have to go to college to read these books that you're gonna read anyway.
CHARLIE: It's only a couple of courses.just for the draft.
MARIO: Charlie, couple of courses isn't enough to get you student deferred. I mean if they wanted to draft you, you would've been drafted by now. CHARLIE feels that it would be better not to pursue the point.
GIOVANNI: What Mario's trying to tell you, Charlie, is that you're wasting your time with those "couple of courses" .you don't need them. There are a lot of things that can be taken care of.you know what I They all laugh.
GIOVANNI: These politicians.they talk nice. CHARLIE listen attentively, but obviously has heard GIOVANNI'S philosophy before.
GIOVANNI: ( CONTINUING )
CHARLIE: What did he do?
GIOVANNI: What did he do? He was there. that's what he did.
MARIO: In the fifties when the communists started in with this country and they tried to clean them out, we offered to do it for them.but they didn't want us to.so we kept out of it. CHARLIE nods.
GIOVANNI: ( TO CHARLIE )
GIOVANNI: You're still around with that kid Johnny Boy.last night with that gun.Don't get mixed up with them. This Johnny Boy, you know, he's named after me.
GIOVANNI: ( CONFIDENTIALLY )
CHARLIE: .The one who's sick, right? In the head.
GIOVANNI: .The one who's sick, right? In the head.
CHARLIE: No, she's got epilepsy.
GIOVANNI: Yeah. That's what I said, sick in the head. CHARLIE nods.
GIOVANNI: Her mother and father come to me and ask advice.she wants to leave.get her own apartment.worries them sick.what am I gonna tell them? Lock her up?
CHARLIE: What do they expect you to say?
GIOVANNI: Who knows? It's not hard to figure out what she'll wind up like. When the respect for parents breaks down, that's bad.you know I'm "cumpari" with them.so I take an interest. You live next door, keep an eye open.but don't get involved.
CHARLIE: All right.
MARIO: Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?
CHARLIE: Oh, that's ok.I've been in and out of this place fifty times.
GIOVANNI: Well, maybe you missed something?
CHARLIE: ( CATCHING ON )
CHARLIE: ( CONFESSION )
COOK: Hi Charlie. CHARLIE smiles and moves in closer to the grill. The cook is sweating and mopping his brow.
COOK: ( CONTINUING ) ( SMILING )
CHARLIE: ( SMILING )
COOK: Maybe so.but at this pay it ain't worth it.that much I can tell you. CHARLIE hasn't been listening to the COOK. He has become fascinated with the flames on the grill. They remind him of an old device from his Catholic School days. CHARLIE brings his hand forward and closer to the fire, testing the pain of the "Fires of Hell."
CHARLIE: ( CONFESSION )
TONY: Is it near Sullivan Street?
JIMMY: No - by Bedford.
TONY: Oh - you gotta show me. I always get lost in the village.
CHARLIE: Next time, bet with your own kind.
JIMMY: The number was 235 - I bet it It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
CHARLIE: It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
JIMMY: I bet 235. Because I dreamt of my grandfather - and when he died, the number of the funeral parlour was 235 - so when I dreamt.
JOHNNY BOY: Yeah, yeah - enough. They arrive at the bar.
JOEY: Hello Charlie, you canonized yet?
CHARLIE: No - not yet - just blessed.

JOHNNY BOY: ( under his breath )
SCUMBAG: ( nudging JOHNNY BOY ) ( under his breath ) Shut up.
TONY: ( nudging JOHNNY BOY ) ( under his breath ) Shut up.
JOEY: ( MAKING EXCUSE )
CHARLIE: Whatever, just lets settle this and it's all forgotten.
JOHNNY BOY: I don't forget nothin. JOEY looks at JOHNNY BOY but decides to let it pass. CHARLIE gives JOHNNY BOY a dirty look. Music is playing on a juke box. Several girls stand nearby listening to both the music and the discussion. JOHNNY BOY looks over at them and then at JOEY.
JOHNNY BOY: Lower the fuckin musicI can't hear nothin.
JOEY: The girls like it loud.
JOHNNY BOY: Girls? You call those skanks girls?! JOEY, his friends, and the girls all look up. JOEY'S attitude changes.
JOEY: ( TO CHARLIE )
JOHNNY BOY: I feel finenothing wrong with me.
CHARLIE: Keep your mouth shut.
JOHNNY BOY: You tell me that in front of these We won't pay.
JOEY: We won't pay.
JIMMY: Why? We just said.
JOHNNY BOY: ( INTERRUPTING )
JIMMY: But I didn't say nothin. The fellows look at each other bewildered.
JOEY: ( TO JIMMY )
JIMMY: ( ANGRILY )
JIMMY: You can't call me a mook! JIMMY swings at JOEY. A fight breaks out. JIMMY, CHARLIE, TONY and JOHNNY BOY are beaten. CHARLIE, not badly hurt manages to calm everything down. The police arrive to break up the fight. People look iin as the two cops walk into the bar. The boys stop fighting immediately as they see the In fact, they treat CHARLIE and the others as friends helping them up off the floor, dusting off the clothes, etc. The police search everyone. When they ask who started it what happened, etc. everybody including CHARLIE and the others cover for everyone else. "It was a joke officer" "He's my cousin" "We were just kidding," etc. The cops nod. "Play nice now" and leave. Everyone apologizes to each other. They drink again. JOHNNY BOY doesn't say a wordjust stares.
JOEY: We were gonna pay you Jimmy, we just don't like being moved in on.
CHARLIE: C'mon I'm movin' in on you? Let's have another drink and forget about it. They drink again. JOEY gives JIMMY the money, JIMMY goes to count it.
JOEY: Don't count it.it's all there.
JOHNNY BOY: ( SARCASTIC )
JOEY: Hey, c'mon - no bullshit - friends. JOEY extends his hand. JIMMY and CHARLIE shake. JOEY extends his hand to JOHNNY.
JOHNNY BOY: Don't fuckin' touch me - scumbag. CHARLIE and the others "Oh no."
CHARLIE: Shut up stupid. He is interrupted by a flying fist. The fight breaks out anew. They barely make it to the door. JIMMY is out first, with his cash. They run down the street. The west side boys don't chase them but stand by their bar shouting after JOHNNY is laughing as he runs. CHARLIE yells at him.
CHARLIE: You got some mouth!
JIMMY: Johnny, you're a real jerk-off.
JOHNNY BOY: ( LAUGHING )
TONY: ( about to take off ) Fuck youse all. The others jump in.
CHARLIE: You got no honor Tony. Charge! The car starts off. Garbage and garbage pails are tosses after them as the boys take off.
CHARLIE: No, really, I liked it.thought it was great.

CHARLIE: What are your plans?

MICHAEL: I tell you, Charlie. If that kid doesn't show up tonight.

MICHAEL: .and his other leg to that Chrysler over there. JOHNNY BOY'S other leg is tied to the Chrysler.
MICHAEL: .and bam!!! We see a close-up of a foot slamming down on the gas pedal, twice. One car heads for the West Sidethe other to the East Side. Tires screech and exhaust fumes fill the air. All three laugh.
CHARLIE: Look, Michael, I'll get him here. What do you want me to do, kill him?
MICHAEL: CHARLIE leaves.
CHARLIE: Are you sure he didn't say anything to you about tonight?
TERESA: For God's Sakes.I told you ( she moves closer ) Charlie, I can't stay in here too long at this hour.will you please listen to me?
CHARLIE: ( MUTTERING )
TERESA: But Charlie.it's uptown and it's perfect. It's big enough for two people.she's going to get out by the end of the month. If you don't act right away, it'll go in no time. What do you think?
TERESA: Don't you realize what that apartment means? CHARLIE doesn't answer. TERESA continues.
TERESA: Do you? For both of us. Think. after a while you might even be able to move in yourself. CHARLIE laughs. TERESA is visibly shaken but CHARLIE cannot be bothered.
CHARLIE: Are you serious? Me move in with you. You crazy?
CHARLIE: ( CONTINUES ) CUT TO: CHARLIE'S WINDOW
CHARLIE'S WINDOW: JOHNNY BOY is at CHARLIE's window. Through it he can see TERESA lying on the bed in tears and CHARLIE pacing back and forth across the room.
CHARLIE: Where were you? Answer me, you sonofabitch! Where were you? TERESA is frightened and rushes towards CHARLIE. JOHNNY BOY reacts to the scene with uncontrolled laughter. CHARLIE is outraged and slaps him across the face but JOHNNY continues to laugh. TERESA screams.
CHARLIE: ( TO TERESA )
JOHNNY BOY: ( TO TERESA )
CHARLIE: You had me going crazy! TERESA is crying. JOHNNY goes into the kitchen and CHARLIE follows. TERESA stays in the doorway.
CHARLIE: Your cousin here was getting sick, worrying about you. We've been in here calling.
JOHNNY BOY: Oh, that's too bad, Teresa. CHARLIE is embarrassed and TERESA is afraid.
JOHNNY BOY: ( CONTINUES )
CHARLIE: Don't be smart.
JOHNNY BOY: I'm not smart.I'm stupid, remember. I'm so stupid that you have to look out for me, remember? TERESA is crying.
JOHNNY BOY: Don't be upset Teresa. You have to understand Charlie, here.he gives of himself to help others.
TERESA: I'm going to go home.
JOHNNY BOY: No, you stay.
CHARLIE: Johnny, I swear to God, if you open your mouth about any of this.
JOHNNY BOY: ( ANGRY )
JOHNNY BOY: ( SHOUTING )
JOHNNY BOY: You rat bastard!! Don't hit me CHARLIE stops.
JOHNNY BOY: I think I will fuckin go see your uncle right now.he'd be interested. CHARLIE rushes JOHNNY BOY towards the stairs. They bump into TERESA, slamming her against the wall.
CHARLIE: Go ahead! Go on! And we'll see what happens to you without me. TERESA is terrified that JOHNNY BOY will really go to CHARLIE'S uncle.
TERESA: TERESA falls, hitting the stairs with a thud. She lies there moaning and tossing her head. CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY go to help her.
CHARLIE: What do I do? You know anything about this? JOHNNY BOY steps over TERESA to go down the stairs. He turns.
JOHNNY BOY: I don't know.she's your girl.I gotta go. CHARLIE is furious. JOHNNY BOY points to TERESA who is getting worse.
JOHNNY BOY: Hate to miss the floor show, though. CHARLIE lunges out at JOHNNY BOY shoving him halfway down the stairs. He has gotten hold of his coat so that JOHNNY BOY can't leave. Neighbors from downstairs open their doors and come up the stairs. CHARLIE, in complete panic, tries to put something into TERESA'S mouth while holding JOHNNY BOY at the same time. He shoves his hand into her mouth trying to pry it open but she bites into it. CHARLIE screams as the blood streams out. He lets go of JOHNNY BOY.
CHARLIE: You crazy bastard! What are you trying to do, ruin me? JOHNNY BOY is not fighting back anymore. He is on the verge of tears. CHARLIE smashes him against the door againagain the crashing sound reverberates in the empty street.
CHARLIE: Again, JOHNNY BOY is thrown up against the door.
CHARLIE: You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you?
JOHNNY BOY: What you're doing for me isn't worth it.believe me! CHARLIE slaps JOHNNY BOY and pushes him against the door Then don't show up tonight and see what happens. CHARLIE stops. He digs his hands into JOHNNY'S pockets but he can't find anything.
CHARLIE: Then don't show up tonight and see what happens. CHARLIE stops. He digs his hands into JOHNNY'S pockets but he can't find anything.
CHARLIE: How much have you got for Michael I only got eight bucks on me. CHARLIE stares at JOHNNY BOY for a moment then puts his hand into his own pocket and pulls out three ten dollar bills and three ones.
JOHNNY BOY: I only got eight bucks on me. CHARLIE stares at JOHNNY BOY for a moment then puts his hand into his own pocket and pulls out three ten dollar bills and three ones.
CHARLIE: Here, take twenty bucks. With your eight that makes twenty-eight bucks you give Michael. I keep the thirteen for the weekend. Maybe we'll eat some Chinese food later. JOHNNY BOY doesn't take it. CHARLIE forces it into his hand.
CHARLIE: Take it. I'm doing it for you, No you're not. CHARLIE, calmer now, is feeling ashamed.
JOHNNY BOY: No you're not. CHARLIE, calmer now, is feeling ashamed.
CHARLIE: Oh, cut it out, will ya?
JOHNNY BOY: Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing. The only way to do it is through your uncle.think about it will you?
CHARLIE: NO!!! What do you think I am, No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
JOHNNY BOY: No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
CHARLIE: Come on. He tugs JOHNNY BOY along.
TONY: You're over an hour late. Michael said he'll be back later, though.
CHARLIE: Watch this kid for me. I have to go someplace but I'll be back soon to get Michael and him together. Don't even let him go to the He turns to JOHNNY BOY.
CHARLIE: Don't you move!!!
JOHNNY BOY: ( SULKING )
CHARLIE: 6th Avenue and Waverly Place, fast The cab takes off. They soon arrive at their destination.
CAB DRIVER: Where do you want me to stop? CHARLIE leans back into the seat and peeks out the window.
CHARLIE: No.don't stop.just pass real slow, OK? CHARLIE looks out the window and sees DIANE, the negro stripper. She is standing on the corner waiting for him. CHARLIE nods his head for the driver to stop.
CHARLIE: Stop here.
CAB DRIVER: ( SIGHING )
JOHNNY BOY: Back so soon.
CHARLIE: Mind your own business. TONY sets up drinks for them and pours them into shot glasses. CHARLIE strikes a match and lights each glass. little blue flames dance along the rims of the glasses.
TERESA: Hey, cut it out. Will ya? He blows out the flames. CHARLIE moves to the other and of the room with his drink.
CHARLIE: ( CONFESSION )
CHARLIE: ( TO TONY )
TONY: How do you know?
CHARLIE: How do you know?
TONY: Look at her.
CHARLIE: She don't look Jewish.
TONY: Sure she is. She's always in here with some different guy. You know the way they are. CHARLIE approaches the girl.
CHARLIE: I love you. The girl looks at him, first embarrassed, then annoyed.
CHARLIE: ( SMILING )
GIRL: You Italian?
CHARLIE: Yeah why?
GIRL: You don't look it. The girl laughs. Her boyfriend comes out of the men's room. He has her coat in his hand.
GIRL: ( to the Boy ) Fuck off.
BOY: ( STUNNED )
GIRL: You go.I'm staying.
BOY: Let's go!
CHARLIE: It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?
BOY: Look fella.this is private.
CHARLIE: Nothing's private. The GIRL is really scared now.
GIRL: I'd like to leave. CHARLIE won't let go of her arm. She tries to pull away but his grip tightens.
CHARLIE: Whether she wants to or not.she's not going.
BOY: Let go of her. The GIRL is in tears.
GIRL: Stop it.you're hurting me.
CHARLIE: Take her away from me.I mean physically take her away from me. He is holding her so tightly that she is doubling over in pain. The BOY, although he is scared, lunges at CHARLIE. There is a brief scuffle which TONY breaks up.
MICHAEL: What's it gonna be? I was here tonight.you kept me waiting for over an hour. MICHAEL has two friends with him.
JOHNNY BOY: Hello, Michael. I've got something for you.not much.but.
CHARLIE: He has about twenty-eight bucks. it's all he has on him.
MICHAEL: Better than nothing. JOHNNY BOY takes out a ten dollar bill and hands it to him.
MICHAEL: Where's the rest?
CHARLIE: Yeah, where's the rest?
JOHNNY BOY: I bought a few rounds of drinks while waiting. CHARLIE is stunned.
MICHAEL: ( ANGRY )
JOHNNY BOY: You make me laugh, Michael.you know that? I've borrowed money all over the neighborhood and never paid it back.so I couldn't borrow anymore from them.so who's the only jerk off left that I can borrow from without paying back.YOU. Because that's what I think of you.Jerk off. I fuck you where you breathe! MICHAEL lashes out at JOHNNY BOY with the back of his hand. JOHNNY BOY tosses the flaming bill at MICHAEL and quickly pulls out his .22 pistol. Everyone is shocked.
CHARLIE: ( MUTTERING )
MICHAEL: You're not going to use that gun, JOHNNY BOY doesn't answer but holds the gun straight at MICHAEL'S face. MICHAEL turns to go, defying JOHNNY BOY. His friends follow. When he reaches the doorway, he turns.
MICHAEL: You don't have the guts to use that.be seeing you Charlie, Tony, and of course you John.be seeing They leave. JOHNNY BOY is still frozen with the gun in his hand, pointing it at mid-air. CHARLIE slams JOHNNY BOY across the face with his fist. TONY takes the gun from his hand.
CHARLIE: You stupid bastard! Never pull a gun unless you intend to use it. He hits JOHNNY BOY again.
TONY: ( HOLDING GUN )
TONY: Get out of here before this really goes up.
CHARLIE: Hide the gun. Throw it away. Anything. Listen, I gotta borrow your car.I think we should take a ride.away from here for the night.you know what I mean?
TONY: ( RELUCTANTLY )
JOHNNY BOY: I think we should see your uncle.
CHARLIE: JOHNNY BOY
JOHNNY BOY: This can't be settled any other way now.I'll take full blame.
CHARLIE: Forget it.
JOHNNY BOY: What are you going to do? Hide me?
CHARLIE: Good idea. JOHNNY BOY turns away and tunes in the radio to a loud rock I guess you could safely say that this evening has been so far very unimpressive as far as my efforts are concerned.more unproductive. Now, I'd like to know what you do, for an encore, Lord? I know penance is penance but this is something else. JOHNNY BOY opens his eyes.
CHARLIE: ( CONFESSION )
JOHNNY BOY: What are you talking to yourself??? He turns up the radio.
CHARLIE: ( SARCASTIC )
CHARLIE: Hey, what is this guy, crazy?
VOICE: Now, now's the time! CHARLIE turns his head to look. JOHNNY BOY looks up. They fire the gun.
TONY'S CONVERTIBLE: CHARLIE is so shocked that the car is completely out of control. It goes screeching along the street, swerves, and slams into a fire hydrant, breaking it off and causing water to shoot out onto the sidewalk, car and street. CHARLIE has been thrown from the car. He kneels in the street holding his wrist. He is on the yellow letters "FIRE LANE." JOHNNY BOY lies against the side of a buildingstill. CHARLIE goes to the curb and sits there holding his bleeding hand. The police arrive with their guns drawn.
TERESA'S ROOM: TERESA is in bed, asleep. The music can be heard echoing in the background.
NEIGHBORHOOD STREET: The last song of the festival is ending now. As the singers come to a stirring climax they wave and shout in Italian.
SINGERS: Good night.Good night.thank you.good night! The band plays a few bars of "Home Sweet Home." The singers throw kisses to the dispursing crowd. People who have been watching the festival pull down the blinds of shades and go MICHAEL'S CAR - PARKED MICHAEL'S car is parked in a deserted area on the docks. He has his head in his hands. The BOY with him says nothing.
STREET CORNER: CHARLIE is still in shock, sitting on the curb. The police are still walking around in a businesslike manner.
CHARLIE: My uncle didn't come? MARIO says nothing, just nods at him to step outside. CHARLIE goes out into the street. MARIO follows.
MARIO: ( pauses for a moment ) Giovanni says now he done enough. He got you outta jail. Now. ( reaching in pocket ) he wants you outta the way. MARIO hands CHARLIE an envelope containing an airline ticket.
MARIO: He says use it. Don't sell it. He says he'll see you. Someday. Maybe. CHARLIE stares at the ticket in his hand. MARIO is obviously Things worked out rotten kid. Sorry.
MARIO: ( ABRUPTLY )
TONY: Where to?
CHARLIE: ( PREOCCUPIED )
TONY: ( trying to be jolly ) I know, I know, stupid. I mean where you goin'?
CHARLIE: It's an open ticket. I can go anywhere up to $350.
TONY: ( EDGY )
CHARLIE: ( EDGY )
TONY: You flew before?
CHARLIE: You flew before?
TONY: You flew before?
CHARLIE: CUT TO:
CHARLIE: ( IRRITATED )
TONY: Take it easy. I only asked because maybe I could, you know, let you have a little something.
CHARLIE: Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me. My mother can send me some. I don't know.
TONY: How about Teresa? I could talk.
CHARLIE: ( trying not to be impatient ) Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself. I'll write.
TONY: And say what?
CHARLIE: I'll say that I'm travelling.
TONY: Listen, try a place with some sun. Swimming pools. Palm trees. Girls in little French bathing suits.
CHARLIE: ( SMILES )
CHARLIE: Take care of that tiger.
TONY: ( CORRECTING HIM )
CHARLIE: Panther! Same thing.
TONY: Hey.no more good times like before. Until you come back.
CHARLIE: Sure. And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
TONY: ( LAUGHS )
TONY: See you. CHARLIE nods and watches the car pull away. Then he picks up his bag from the sidewalk and walks into the terminal.
CHARLIE: I don't know what to say to you. The ticket desk is under the flight board. CHARLIE eventually works his way over to the desk, drops his bag on the floor and stands staring at the board. He sees the names of dozens of cities flashing before him. As he watches, a pretty ticket clerk speaks to him from behind the desk.
CLERK: May I help you? CHARLIE stares at the flight board in dismay and indecision. He apparently does not hear her.
CLERK: Sir, may I help you? CHARLIE hears her this time. He reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out the ticket which he passes across to her. The clerk starts to open it to check the destination.
CHARLIE: ( questioning, challenging ) Where can I go? The question is unusual. The clerk looks up. CHARLIE stare back at her with a quality that is almost defiance.
