CREASY'S VOICE: Ezekiel 25:17 Blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children.
JORDAN: The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later. His father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass.
SAMUEL: And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included.
JORDAN: If she pisses you off, you get another one.
SAMUEL: ( laughs grimly ) Do you know what she told me last night?
LISA: A man's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes. Only the amount And bankruptcy. Where will that put me in the social strata?
SAMUEL: And bankruptcy. Where will that put me in the social strata?
LISA: I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.
SAMUEL: Our daughter. Our child's safety is at stake.
LISA: Our child's safety is at stake.
SAMUEL: ( stops playing ) These people are professionals. They don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.
LISA: Samuel, it is not something we should skimp on. A bodyguard's presence in the car or outside the school was at least some form of deterrent. Now he's gone, I feel totally exposed.
SAMUEL: Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day.
JORDAN: Yeah? And if she was ugly?
JORDAN: All my clients have kidnap and ransom I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days, without a bodyguard, I will not be able to renew it.
SAMUEL: I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days, without a bodyguard, I will not be able to renew it.
JORDAN: I know you need to please Lisa. An ass like that is hard to find. Good bodyguards are even harder.
SAMUEL: ( interrupts ) I know! I just had to let one go because I couldn't afford him!
JORDAN: You need a bodyguard of some description. It's a dangerous world we live in. But you will get what you pay for. He doesn't need to be Superman, does he? Can you go fifteen grand?
SAMUEL: For a year?
JORDAN: For a few months. Hire someone cheap. You have to have a bodyguard to keep the insurance. Then fire him for incompetence. The important thing is Lisa's daughter will return to school.
SAMUEL: And Lisa will be able to save face. We won't be the only family without a Her beauty fucks with your mind.
JORDAN: Her beauty fucks with your mind.
SAMUEL: For an American she understands this country very well.
JORDAN: She understands men.
CUSTOMS MAN: He flips through Creasy's passport. Even the stamps have stamps. Thailand. Somalia. Cuba. Columbia. Hong Kong. Saudi Arabia. Every country in Europe. Guy's been around. Customs looks up from the ink blue American Eagle to the deep matte black of Creasy's sunglasses. NOTE: Italics denotes the lines spoken in Spanish.
CUSTOMS: Where are you coming from?
CREASY: South America.
CUSTOMS: Where are you staying in Mexico?
CREASY: I'm on to Juarez.
CUSTOMS: I have a friend there.
CREASY: I have a friend there.
CUSTOMS: I cannot see your eyes, Senor.
CUSTOMS: It's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia. The gun you're about to find in that
CREASY: It's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia. The gun you're about to find in that
RAYBURN: Rayburn here.
CREASY: When did Mexican Customs start getting
RAYBURN: Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
CUSTOMS JAIL: I'm here.
CREASY: I'm here.
RAYBURN: What do you mean, I'm here?
CUSTOMS JAIL: I'm in a Customs holding tank in Mexico City International. Bring a bunch of cash. about 5K. I'm going to need it.
CREASY: I'm in a Customs holding tank in Mexico City International. Bring a bunch of cash. about 5K. I'm going to need it.
RAYBURN: This is going to cost you big time.
RAYBURN: You got a secondary search and you had a Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got Everything happens once if you live long It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
CREASY: Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got Everything happens once if you live long It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
RAYBURN: Everything happens once if you live long It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
CREASY: It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
RAYBURN: This is Mexico, they do everything
RAYBURN: So what's wrong?
CREASY: Nothing wrong.
RAYBURN: Don't give me that bullshit.
CREASY: So how's business?
RAYBURN: Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking-Wayne.
CREASY: But don't you stay in El Paso?
RAYBURN: Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king down here.
CREASY: Yeah, right.
RAYBURN: Oh, like you haven't been in worse And a level five shithole is better than a level six. Your logic's inescapable.
CREASY: And a level five shithole is better than a level six. Your logic's inescapable.
RAYBURN: You been working?
CREASY: Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed How long you staying, Crease?
RAYBURN: How long you staying, Crease?
CREASY: ( shrugs ) Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse.
RAYBURN: You did something on impulse?
CREASY: Everything happens once if you live long
PINTA: Dear God. I do not ask for health. Or wealth. People ask you so often that you can't have any left. Give me God what you still have. Give me what no one else asks for. Amen.
LISA: You should be sleeping, baby.
PINTA: I'm trying, mom.
LISA: Good news. You're going back to school.
PINTA: ( sits up; excited ) Samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard. It may take a few days, but you're going
LISA: Samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard. It may take a few days, but you're going
PINTA: Could he speak English? Emilio couldn't speak English.
LISA: We'll see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be
RAYBURN: That's right, a bodyguard.
RAYBURN: Your Spanish is good enough. You certainly look the part.
CREASY: You're crazy. People would hire a has- been, Ray? A drunk?
RAYBURN: Well, you'd have to keep it under And what if, just say, there was a kidnap You do your best. They won't be paying you enough to perform miracles.
CREASY: And what if, just say, there was a kidnap You do your best. They won't be paying you enough to perform miracles.
RAYBURN: You do your best. They won't be paying you enough to perform miracles.
RAYBURN: It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at half speed you're pretty damn good.
CREASY: A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that.
RAYBURN: So you'll be the silent type. People will appreciate that.
RAYBURN: What are you doing here?
CREASY: I came to visit you.
RAYBURN: Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
CREASY: A bodyguard. Who's the guy?
RAYBURN: Samuel Ramos. Owns one of the plants in Juarez. The Jap car industry is in the toilet. He's trying to persuade Ford to partner with him. I think he's in trouble. He asked me if I knew anyone he could trust.
CREASY: Oh, now you think I can be trusted.
RAYBURN: Take a job, Creasy. Breathe some air. Then decide if you want to. stick around or not.
RAYBURN: Instructional tape on what I tell my clients about bodyguarding.
SAMUEL: You drive easily. Smoothly.
CREASY: Show me, please.
SAMUEL: Show me, please.
CREASY: Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
SAMUEL: Have you used this type before?
SAMUEL: Is it loaded?
CREASY: It's loaded.
SAMUEL: You will meet my wife first. She would like it if you are presentable, polite and respectful. You'll be the fifth candidate she's seen this week.
SAMUEL: Your resume is impressive. Nine years in the Army. Extensive counter terrorism work. I shouldn't be able to afford you in my current state. What's the catch?
CREASY: ( honest ) I drink.
SAMUEL: How does it affect you?
CREASY: My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay.
SAMUEL: And what if amateurs try it?
CREASY: I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?
SAMUEL: No. And no one is to know of your drinking problem. That includes my wife.
LISA: The world of our children. How dare It's war. The weakest suffer the most.
CREASY: ( shrugs ) It's war. The weakest suffer the most.
LISA: You're American.
CREASY: So are you.
SAMUEL: ( introducing ) My wife, Mr. Creasy.
LISA: Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.
CREASY: Thank you. Scotch and a little water.
LISA: You've done much of this work before?
CREASY: Samuel sells, covers for Creasy's reticence.
SAMUEL: He has experience in related work. A great deal of it.
LISA: Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?
CREASY: No. I do not have family.
PINTA: Crouched low. In the doorway. She stares back at him a beat, then disappears around the corner.
SITTING ROOM: Creasy frowns. Lisa steps over with Creasy's drink.
CREASY: Thank you.
LISA: A few moments and Pinta arrives. 'Cool Hand Pinta'.
PINTA: Yes, mom?
LISA: This is Mr. Creasy.
LISA: Pinta, show him to his room.
PINTA: This way, Mr. Creasy.
LISA: I think it's nice he's American.
SAMUEL: I think it's fantastic.
LISA: You realize that you've brought a killer into the house.
LISA: Thank you. I feel better now.
PINTA: Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?
CREASY: If they like me.
PINTA: Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
CREASY: ( in German ) Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
PINTA: Frank only responds to commands in German. He was trained in Frankfurt. My Dad loves the idea of having a dog around, but hates the fact he lives
CREASY'S ROOM: Not like downstairs, but comfortable enough.
PINTA: We fixed the room up two weeks ago. Mom and I. It's nicer than before.
PINTA: You've got a CD player if you like music. I like music a lot.
PINTA: That's 'Bird.' Emilio forgot to take him with when he left.
CREASY: Who's Emilio?
PINTA: My last bodyguard. He drove me to school in the morning and picked me up in the
CREASY: I'm here for you?
PINTA: In between you can take Mom shopping and to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr. Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
CREASY: Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
PINTA: ( big grin )
PINTA: Looks like he approves of you.
CREASY'S BAG: He reaches in between the shirts, pulls out a fresh bottle of scotch. He breaks the seal, unscrews the cap. He pours a double. triple. wait, what do you call a full glass of scotch? CAW! The macaw squawks it's disapproval. He ejects the shell from the breach of the 9mm, tries to catch it on the back of his hand. An old game with His hand is too shaky. The bullet bounces off, hits the floor. Creasy picks it up. Ejecting the magazine, he starts to oil the weapon. CAW! As the macaw squawks, Creasy looks up. It doesn't feel like this relationship is going to work.
LISA: School tomorrow, baby.
PINTA: I like him, Mom.
LISA: You do?
PINTA: He's like a great big bear. 'Creasy bear'.
PINTA: There's something about him.
PINTA: I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very
LISA: Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby.
PINTA: Just like you, a big old bear.
CREASY: In his room. Tests his mag spring with his thumb, begins loading up. The full magazine joins with those already Another glass of scotch is poured. Creasy's hands oil the holster. The Sig Sauer is slipped in. The holster is hung over the corner post of the bed. A map is flattened. Creasy's finger traces various routes, pencils them in. From the house to Pinta's The macaw squawks again. Creasy steps over, takes the cage and carries it to the open window. He opens the cage door.
CREASY: Now's your chance.
LISA: She likes him.
SAMUEL: Creasy. Pinta likes him.
LISA: Creasy. Pinta likes him.
SAMUEL: Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there.
CREASY'S ROOM: Creasy's drinking in the dark next to the window, listening to the sounds of Mexico City at night. The empty scotch glass is set down. Ominously sober.
PINTA: Where are you from, Creasy?
CREASY: The United States.
PINTA: I know. But which state?
CREASY: No state in particular.
PINTA: My mom and me are from Houston, Texas. Have you been there?
CREASY: You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
PINTA: You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
CREASY: ( turns left ) Why not?
PINTA: Why not?
CREASY: I'm looking for potential.
PINTA: Potential? I don't understand.
CREASY: Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
PINTA: Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
CREASY: Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
PINTA: Someone gave him more money than we I'm a bargain.
CREASY: I'm a bargain.
PINTA: Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
CREASY: Time will tell.
PINTA: There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
CREASY: Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my fee or get a larger gun.
PINTA: Beep the horn.
COURTYARD: Creasy parks, get out of the car. He looks around, appraising the lay of the land.
PINTA: Isn't it beautiful?
PINTA: Sister Anna, the headmistress. This is Creasy, my bodyguard.
SISTER ANNA: Mr. Creasy.
PINTA: No, Sister, he told me just to call him Creasy. He's American. From no state in You must look after our Pinta. We're so happy to have her back in school. Run along now, Pinta.
SISTER ANNA: You must look after our Pinta. We're so happy to have her back in school. Run along now, Pinta.
SISTER ANNA: She's late, Mr. Creasy.
CREASY: Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I It won't happen again.
SISTER ANNA: No offense, but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.
CREASY: So am I, Sister.
SISTER ANNA: Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?
CREASY: Not for a long time, sister.
SISTER ANNA: The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."
CREASY: Romans, chapter 12, verse 21. I'm the sheep that got lost.
CREASY: I'm the sheep that got lost.
CREASY: Here we go again.
CREASY: Yeah. And Spanish.
CREASY: It's a temporary license for the gun I'm carrying. I just went through all of this at the airport.
RAYBURN: Rayburn here. Creasy, what's up?
CREASY: There's still ink on my fingers from last You got tossed. Don't trust the cops, especially the Judicials. Oh you know that?
RAYBURN'S SUV: You got tossed. Don't trust the cops, especially the Judicials. Oh you know that?
RAYBURN: You got tossed. Don't trust the cops, especially the Judicials. Oh you know that?
PINTA: We're taking a different way home.
CREASY: That's right.
PINTA: I understand. Smart.
PINTA: Did you like school, Creasy?
CREASY: Not at all?
PINTA: Not at all?
CREASY: But why not?
PINTA: But why not?
PINTA: It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
CREASY: It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
PINTA: So you were unhappy?
CREASY: Being unhappy is a state of mind. I never thought about it.
PINTA: Pinta watches Creasy a moment, trying to figure a way in. She looks at his scarred right hand on the wheel. Then, as she reaches out.
PINTA: What happened to.
PINTA: .your hand? No more questions.
CREASY: No more questions.
CREASY: I'm not paid to be your friend. I'm paid to protect you.
CREASY: ( exasperated ) And don't start crying.
PINTA: I'm not crying.
CREASY: Look, this is the way I am. I don't like questions. I
CREASY: Creasy shoulders open his door, bolts out.
INTERSECTION: Creasy has barely straightened himself and Pinta is already getting back in the car. This time in the Creasy sighs. The light goes green. Scooters whine away and horns blare.
MERCEDES: Creasy sits back behind the wheel.
PINTA: You can take me home now, Mr. Creasy.
CREASY: Come in.
LISA: Mr. Creasy, I wanted to make sure you have everything you need.
CREASY: I'm fine.
LISA: Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
CREASY: The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.
LISA: ( smiles ) It insults Maria. Slip it to the dog if you have to. Do you mind if I talk to you for a moment?
LISA: How are you getting along with Pinta?
CREASY: We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
LISA: ( smiles ) Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
CREASY: You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
LISA: You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
CREASY: You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?
CREASY: Look. Maybe this isn't going to work. Maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone. more sociable.
LISA: No, you're right. You were hired to protect her, that's enough. I'm confident you'll do that. I didn't realize you had a gun. I know that's silly to say.
LISA: I didn't realize you had a gun. I know that's silly to say.
LISA: It makes it all seem so serious.
CREASY: It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.
LISA: Please, it's Lisa. I'll be coming with you tomorrow. I have lunch with friends.
PINTA: Give me God what you still have. Give me what no one else asks for. "I'm going back someday, come what may, to Blue Bayou."
RONSTADT: "I'm going back someday, come what may, to Blue Bayou."
LINDA RONSTADT: Well I'll never be blue, my dreams come true, on Blue Bayou.
RAYBURN: Rayburn. Creasy! What's wrong?
CREASY: I said, have you ever had a nine millimeter round that just didn't go off?
RAYBURN: You mean a misfire?
CREASY: I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.
RAYBURN: I've heard of it. Never happened to me though. Maybe the firing pin's off.
CREASY: Creasy is troubled about it all to say the least.
RAYBURN: It's like we always used to say: a bullet always tells the truth. What were you shooting at? Sorry I woke you, Ray.
RAYBURN: ( focusing; concerned )
CREASY: Sorry I woke you, Ray.
CREASY: Pinta, do you have a pencil?
PINTA: I go to school, don't I?
CREASY: Her little hand comes over the top of the seat with a pencil. Creasy takes it, slows to let the Corolla catch up. He squints into the mirror to read the plate. Lisa is oblivious, but as Pinta looks back over her BRAKE LIGHTS up ahead. Creasy lurches to a stop. The Corolla swerves around them disappears ahead.
CREASY: The traffic takes some getting used to.
LISA: The traffic takes some getting used to.
PINTA: Bye, Mom.
LISA: Don't forget your towel.
MERCEDES: Creasy gets back in, starts away.
LISA: She has swimming practice today. You'll need to pick her up at the pool.
LISA: I talked to her. She understands. She won't bother you anymore.
LISA: ( sees him ) ( stepping over )
JORDAN: So you're the bodyguard? You used to be, what did they used to call it, a soldier of fortune?
EVELYN: ( giggles ) Does he talk?
EVELYN: He's sexy.
JORDAN: You see any danger out there? The fear's worse than the reality.
JORDAN: I always wanted to ask a bodyguard, would you take a bullet for your employer, for
CREASY: I wasn't hired to guard Mr. Ramos.
JORDAN: For Pinta then?
LISA: If something happened, my reaction would be to fight to protect her. I have skills in that respect. Pinta would benefit by the fact that. I'm a What kind of an answer is that?
CREASY: If something happened, my reaction would be to fight to protect her. I have skills in that respect. Pinta would benefit by the fact that. I'm a What kind of an answer is that?
JORDAN: What kind of an answer is that?
CREASY: The answer is the truth. The question is
LISA: Jordan, thank you for the lovely lunch. I promise not to let Evelyn spend too
MERCEDES: Creasy gets behind the wheel. Pulls into traffic. As he goes, he checks the rear view mirror. Jordan remains standing on the curb watching the car pull away. Something odd about it all.
CREASY: You're fast.
PINTA: Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up, it's too
CREASY: Hey. Pinta.
CREASY: What are you doing?
PINTA: Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
CREASY: Do you think he'll come back?
PINTA: Maybe. Did you hear him?
CREASY: How do you think he got out?
PINTA: How do you think he got out?
CREASY: ( a beat ) Well, I let him go.
PINTA: It's better to be free, right?
CREASY: Yes. Actually, he was driving me crazy.
PINTA: I got you to talk, Creasy bear.
RONSTADT: ".I'm so lonesome all the time, since I left my baby behind, on Blue Bayou."
LISA: I'll call you from Detroit, baby.
PINTA: You're going to miss Mexican Halloween. The Day of the Dead.
SAMUEL: You enjoy it for us, Pinta.
CREASY: They'll be back in a week.
PINTA: They can stay for two weeks. I don't
CREASY: The food is excellent, Maria. You have a real talent.
MARIA: My pleasure, Creasy.
CHIMNEY: Pinta coming down the other slope. There's the macaw.
PINTA: Come on. Come on. Bird!
PINTA'S VOICE: Creasy is on his feet, out the door in a heartbeat.
CREASY!: Creasy is on his feet, out the door in a heartbeat.
CREASY: She's in a lot of pain, but moving her arms and head. Frank's licking her face.
PINTA: It hurts.
CREASY: ( Short )
PINTA: ( Short )
CREASY: I don't think they're broken. Anywhere My ankle.
PINTA: My ankle.
CREASY: I'm going to get you out, okay?
PINTA: Oh, Creasy.
CREASY: It's okay. She's just scared.
LISA: You're sure she's alright?
LISA: Okay, good, you're sure. He took her for an X-ray, but it's just a bruise and a sprain.
LISA: Thank you, Creasy. Give her my love.
PINTA'S BEDROOM: Pinta in bed propped up by a pillow, teddy bear beside her. Frank at the head of the bed.
PINTA: The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, didn't White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now.
CREASY: White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now.
CREASY: Do you always sleep with him?
PINTA: I'm too old for him. Don't tell my I don't talk to them much. Does he have a name? I spoke to your mother. She sends her
CREASY: I don't talk to them much. Does he have a name? I spoke to your mother. She sends her
CREASY: I spoke to your mother. She sends her
CREASY: Some bodyguard I turned out to be. Good night, Pinta.
PINTA: Creasy? Could you play the song?
CREASY: Blue Bayou. You got it.
PINTA: I think I'll sit in the front. There's more room for my foot.
PINTA: He's only allowed to travel in the car on weekends. Dad says the car will smell
CREASY: Did you sleep alright?
PINTA: How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
CREASY: How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
PINTA: It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
CREASY: In a week you should be fine.
PINTA: Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
CREASY: You need to practice.
PINTA: I will.
PINTA: Creasy, what's a concubine?
CREASY: Why do you ask?
PINTA: It was in a book at school. Concubine.
CREASY: Well, it's a sort of wife.
PINTA: But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
CREASY: In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules.
PINTA: It must be difficult having lots of You feel sorry for the husband?
CREASY: You feel sorry for the husband?
PINTA: ( in Spanish ) Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand?
PINTA: Creasy, you're smiling.
CREASY: I guess I am.
PINTA: So how come you know so much about those I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
CREASY: I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
PINTA: What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
CREASY: No, that was in Columbia.
GOMEZ: Humming to himself as he brushes the leaves out of the empty SWIMMING POOL.
RAMOS POOL: In her swimsuit and cap, Pinta crouches in makeshift starting blocks.
CREASY: Pinta takes off. Splashes into the water. Not to Creasy's satisfaction.
CREASY: No, no, come back.
CREASY: You don't flinch when a gun goes off; you react. You go. Don't listen for the sound; don't anticipate it. Concentrate on the sound itself.
PINTA: I don't understand.
CREASY: Don't worry. You will.
PINTA: Creasy, what happened to your hand? A man asked me questions once. He smoked a lot. There was no ashtray.
CREASY: A man asked me questions once. He smoked a lot. There was no ashtray.
CREASY: Remember you asked me what state I was Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.
PINTA: Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.
CREASY: Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.
PINTA: Good things happen, too, Creasy. Like meeting me.
CREASY: ( after a beat ) I guess that really does make me a hard
PINTA: Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy?
CREASY: Did you used to?
PINTA: Did you used to?
CREASY: Yeah. Two or three.
LISA: Creasy, tomorrow, after you drop off Pinta, could you come back to take me to get my hair done?
LISA: Alright, I'll leave you two to your
CREASY: Don't move.
LISA: Murdering people in the street. You had your gun, why didn't you shoot them?
CREASY: Nothing to do with me. Or you. Besides, there was another one in the passenger side of the van with a sawed-off shotgun. If I'd started shooting his friends, he would've had me. And you.
CREASY: A minimum close protection team consists of four men for high threat targets and environments. Even in a low threat situation, you need two guards plus a security trained driver.
PINTA: ( happy to see him ) You're late.
CREASY: I'm sorry.
PINTA: You were never late before, I was
PINTA: Where's my mother?
CREASY: I dropped her at home.
PINTA: It's no wonder you're late. Why didn't she just come with you?
PINTA: Do you think my mother likes you?
CREASY: I think she's afraid of me. But not the same way most people are.
PINTA: I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
CREASY: I know you're not.
PINTA: Are you afraid of me?
CREASY: I used to be. At first. But not
PINTA: EXT. GARDEN POOL - RAMOS VILLA - DAY Heated. Steam rising off the water. PINTA stands with her eyes closed. Creasy, standing beside her, brings TWO BLOCKS together with a WHACK!
CREASY: The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.
PINTA: The gunshot holds no fear.
CREASY: You welcome the sound. The sound is what lets you go. The sound is what frees you. You are a prisoner in those blocks until you hear the sound.
PINTA: I'm tough, Creasy. I'm tough as you.
CREASY: There's no such thing as tough. You're either trained or untrained.
CREASY: Sleeping, looking sexy.
PINTA: Hi, Dad.
SAMUEL: I want to thank you, Creasy. For what you did for my wife.
LINDA RONSTADT: I'm going back someday, come what may, to Blue Bayou.
PINTA: What's so important in Los Angeles?
CREASY: Your father has business.
PINTA: Why today? And why'd she have to go with
CREASY: Good luck. I'll be waiting here when you're done.
PINTA: You're coming with me.
PINTA: Stand near the finish line.
CREASY: She turns, looks back at him.
CREASY: The blocks.
PINTA: ( smiles; knows ) I'm a prisoner in them. Until the gunshot sets me free.
SISTER ANNA: Mr. Creasy, nice to see you.
CREASY: ( apologetic ) Pinta's parents are in Los Angeles. I was going to wait in the courtyard,
SISTER ANNA: Today you are her father.
STARTER'S PISTOL: Pointed up at precisely 45 degrees. BAAAANGG!
STARTING BLOCKS: Eyes closed serenely, Pinta surges forward, leaving everyone behind.
CREASY: Sees it. She hasn't even hit the water and he already knows she's won.
PINTA: SPLASH! Ten meters in before she breaks the surface. Her head sweeping left and then right.
SURFACE: And the finish line seems to come to her.
THE CROWD: Cheers enthusiastically as she reaches the finish wall.
CREASY: Watches her, satisfied with what he's done. Pinta hauls herself out of the water and runs. A beeline for Creasy. And the poor fucker doesn't even understand, until she's leaping the last few feet. Into his arms.
PINTA: I won, Creasy! I won!
PINTA: My Dad said all your friends were dead.
RAYBURN: All but one. The most important one. When we were eighteen, we made an agreement to "take the world" together.
CREASY: Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said what happened to the plan?
RAYBURN: I said the plan was right here.
CREASY: I hung up on him. When I met Alicia, I got it.
CREASY: Can I kiss her now, or after you've gone to bed? Okay, I think now is as good as time as
PINTA: Okay, I think now is as good as time as
PINTA: I bought it with my own money. I saved
PINTA: It's St. Jude, the patron saint of lost And hard cases. Creasy's the reason St. Jude became a Saint in the first place.
RAYBURN: And hard cases. Creasy's the reason St. Jude became a Saint in the first place.
PINTA: Yeah, that's right.
CREASY: Thank you, Pinta, it's beautiful.
RAYBURN: Come on, baby. I feel like a third wheel. Watch the kid.
PINTA: Could I ask you a question?
CREASY: Could I stop you?
PINTA: You don't drink like you used to.
CREASY: That's not a question.
PINTA: I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
CREASY: Still not a question.
PINTA: My mom drinks, too. Why do people drink, Creasy?
CREASY: Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
PINTA: You think too much?
CREASY: Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough.
LISA: He has to go, Samuel.
SAMUEL: What? Who?
LISA: Why? You were so pleased with him.
SAMUEL: Why? You were so pleased with him.
LISA: Pinta likes him too much. She thinks of him as a father.
SAMUEL: That's ridiculous.
LISA: It's not.
SAMUEL: I've just been so busy, Lisa.
LISA: He has to go.
SAMUEL: The three month trial ends in a week. I just won't confirm the position. That possibility was understood when I hired
SAMUEL: I won't create bad feelings. And another week won't make a difference. It will be a hard break.
SAMUEL: It will be a hard break.
LISA: She's young. She'll get over it.
SAMUEL: I wasn't thinking of Pinta.
SAMUEL: Creasy, how are you?
PINTA: I don't want to play piano! I want to No discussion, Pinta. Mr. Lozzi is a famous teacher. If he accepts you, you will play.
SAMUEL: No discussion, Pinta. Mr. Lozzi is a famous teacher. If he accepts you, you will play.
PINTA: Frank. Frankie.
CREASY: Pinta, we've got to go. Travel sucks at this time.
PINTA: Frank. Frankie.
CREASY: That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride.
PINTA: ( distant ) You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still Don't be a baby. You're tougher than There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.
CREASY: Don't be a baby. You're tougher than There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.
PINTA: There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.
CREASY: ( smiles ) Then be trained.
PINTA: I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.
CREASY: Be a swimmer.
PINTA: I could do it. Remember the day you wanted the pencil? I know why. And I saw that car again. I wrote the license number in my notebook. Except I missed the last number.
CREASY: You'll have to show me that number when we get home.
CREASY: Continue to play in the wrong key, like you're dyslexic.
PINTA: Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has a complete block about 'C' Minor. But remember, "Whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves." New Testament, Romans 13.
CREASY: Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has a complete block about 'C' Minor. But remember, "Whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves." New Testament, Romans 13.
PINTA: You got that right.
CREASY: You'll be back in the water in twenty- four hours.
PINTA: For you, Creasy.
CREASY: Remember 'dyslexic.'
CREASY: Looking up from the window of the Mercedes. As Pinta is called back inside, Creasy checks out, twirls the dandelion Pinta gave him. HUMS to himself. "Blue THE STREET Creasy leaning against the Mercedes. Traffic pounding by. The dandelion is stuck in a button hole of his And then suddenly traffic thins out. Reminiscent of the previous two kidnappings. It's a process. Creasy straightens up. A Judicial POLICE CAR cruises by, slowly. Creasy makes eye contact with the two cops up front. The same guys who were at Zona Rosa. Creasy starts across the street toward the apartment building. At the same time as. The door bangs open. Pinta exiting. She spots Creasy, a huge grin on her face. She was not accepted. And a white TOYOTA COROLLA coming the other way. The police car reverses back, cutting Creasy off from Pinta. The COPS getting out, big smiles on their faces.
THE STREET: Creasy leaning against the Mercedes. Traffic pounding by. The dandelion is stuck in a button hole of his And then suddenly traffic thins out. Reminiscent of the previous two kidnappings.

And a white TOYOTA COROLLA coming the other way. The police car reverses back, cutting Creasy off from Pinta. The COPS getting out, big smiles on their faces.
THE COROLLA: Slides to a stop in front of Pinta, blocking her path to Creasy. And as TWO MEN leap out from the backseat.
CREASY: ( drawing his 9mm ) Run, Pinta, run!
PINTA'S VOICE: And Pinta is back. Running toward Creasy. She can't leave him like this. She was safe and now she's back.
CREASY!: And Pinta is back. Running toward Creasy. She can't leave him like this. She was safe and now she's back.
CREASY: She runs to him, wraps her arms around him.
PINTA: MAN TWO catches up, tears Pinta away, starts back for the sedan. Creasy can only blink after them.
PINTA: It's not a cry for help. It's anguish for him.
CREASY: MAN TWO crams her in the back seat, follows. The fat driver gets back in behind the wheel. As the door slams shut, wheels spin, grip and the Corolla accelerates away. We just see Pinta look back through the rear windshield. An anguished image before she's pulled back down. Creasy makes a wish. Not for himself, but for her.
CREASY: Don't die, Creasy, don't die.
BLACK: Sound breaks through first. The whir and beep of medical equipment. And we fade back into:
CHIEF: This man, Senor Robert Creasy, an American citizen, is under arrest for the murder of two police officers, Hector Gonzalez and Pablo Lunara. He is also the prime suspect in the kidnapping of Pinta Martin Ramos.
LISA: Sitting catatonic. In the dark. Halfway to mourning already. A HUBBUB drifts up from the rooms below.
LAWYER: When did he say he would call back? Do not tell them you have a kidnap They usually ask for three times the amount they expect.
TAZINARI: Senor Ramos. I am Ernesto Tazinari, commandante of the Judicial anti- kidnapping division.
JORDAN: We do not need or want police involvement. I am the negotiator. We feel a better guarantee of getting Pinta back without your involvement.
TAZINARI: I have a written order from the Public Ministry. Two police officers were This is the Attorney General Navarro Bernal Diaz.
TAZINARI: The law requires an intervention by the authorities "de officio."
SAMUEL: It's impossible. I cannot afford thirty million. I will need to borrow the
SAMUEL: The realities are I do not have access to this type of money.
KIDNAPPER: Two and a half million in two different bags. The bags you can get from Save-On. Fifteen gallon, black canvas, divide the money equally.
SAMUEL: Yes, I will give you interest.
KIDNAPPER: I will instruct you on the exchange over the next 24 hours.
END MONTAGE: CUT TO:
CHIEF: The girl is a Mexican citizen. Her father is Samuel Valencia Ramos.
CONFERENCE: Rosanna, the woman we saw on T.V. earlier, stands watching and listening. Incredulous and angry. MIGUEL MANZANO the Director of AFI ( also seen earlier on TV ), approaches with his two assistants and kisses Rosanna on the cheek.
ROSANNA: A bodyguard was shot trying to protect a 9 year old. The bodyguard's American. Not only that he's black.
MANZANO: Is that good or bad?
ROSANNA: That's good. Really good. He shot and killed two judicial cops and a kidnapper died in the attack. They're saying he's
REPORTER ONE: Beside the American in custody, are any other Americans involved in the We're looking into it.
CHIEF: We're looking into it.
ROSANNA: The two officers who were killed. Records show they were off duty at the
CHIEF: I'm not sure. All I know is they died
ROSANNA: If they were off duty, why were they in a patrol car? What exactly were they doing at the scene of a kidnapping?
ROSANNA: Were they known for their exceptional good luck?
CHIEF: They were known for their professionalism and integrity!
COP ONE: No visitors.
COP TWO: Who are you?
RAYBURN: I'm here to see my friend.
COP TWO: Rayburn swallows his anger, starts fishing for his wallet. Suddenly, the thugs snap to attention. Manzano is on the way down followed by ADJUTANT and TWO
MANZANO: When I heard it was this hospital I was so pleased. There's a pastry shop nearby. Delgado's. Do you know it?
MANZANO: The best pastries in Mexico.
RAYBURN: He's not a cop killer.
MANZANO: I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing.
RAYBURN: He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him.
MANZANO: So am I.
RAYBURN: You hear me, Crease?
CREASY: Two days gone. They're negotiating a These things take time, Mr. Creasy.
RAYBURN: Two days gone. They're negotiating a These things take time, Mr. Creasy.
MANZANO: These things take time, Mr. Creasy.
VOICE: You have the money.
JORDAN: OK,repeat the drop instructions.
VOICE: OK,repeat the drop instructions.
JORDAN: The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.
VOICE: The car will not be powerful and have no
JORDAN: I need a driver to drive Samuel, the No. Why?
VOICE: No. Why?
JORDAN: He has a heart condition. Angina. He responds badly to stress.
VOICE: OK. You will arrive at Columbus Circle and Reforma Avenue at 3AM. You will drive around the square two times. Samuel will remove his shirt and hold it out the window to I.D. the car.
JORDAN: We need proof of life.
VOICE: Is the father, there?
SAMUEL: If this girl's life is as important to you as it is to me, do not play with the process. Family is everything. I am a professional. You keep your word and I will keep mine.
VOICE: If this girl's life is as important to you as it is to me, do not play with the process. Family is everything. I am a professional. You keep your word and I will keep mine.
RAYBURN: What's the deal here?
ROSANNA: I wouldn't gamble leaving him here. These guys will kill him in a heartbeat 'while trying to stop him from escaping.'
SAMUEL: He said no phones!
TAZINARI: You do your job. I'll do mine.
CREASY: She's dead. Isn't she?
RAYBURN: It was a fuck up. Someone hijacked the drop. The kidnapper, his nephew got
FLASHBACK: INT. CAR - MEXICO CITY CU of Pinta looking up at Creasy. The camera ramps into Pinta's smile. A small, but a sinificant moment in terms of their connection.
K&R AGENT: No, not us.No we did not.
RAYBURN: She's dead Creasy.
MANZANO: She's dead. They fucked with 'the process' and his nephew died.
DOCTOR: He suffered gunshot wounds to the upper extremity, chest and abdomen. He has a collapsed lung which is stabilized, injured his spleen, which we may have to remove and ruptured his intestine. He's on strict bedrest or there's a good chance we could lose him.
NURSE: A strange man. He has much experience of Did he say so?
MANZANO: Did he say so?
NURSE: No. But a nurse knows.
MUGSHOT: Manzano and the adjutant have pulled chairs up alongside the bed. The adjutant flips through one of the binders. Each page holds a single MUGSHOT. Each time Creasy shakes his head, the adjutant flips to the next photo.
MANZANO: Creasy shakes his head.
MANZANO: Excellent work by the way. Three men dead. Only ten rounds fired.
MANZANO: If two of the men in my division could shoot like that, I could get rid of the other thirty-six.
CREASY: What am I doing here?
MANZANO: Believe it or not, you're safe here. The Judicial police will kill you. If they This page?
CREASY: The adjutant reaches the last page. Creasy shakes his
MANZANO: You have a rather checkered past. Mr. Creasy. Your Interpol file is six pages Am I a suspect?
CREASY: Am I a suspect?
MANZANO: No. It would be convenient, but no.
CREASY: Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen. Maybe then we'll get somewhere.
MANZANO: All these photos you just saw were of policemen. Sadly they're protected. La Hermanidad. The brotherhood.
RAYBURN: ( whispers )
RAYBURN: How do you feel?
CREASY: Stomach's gone. But. okay.
RAYBURN: I'll get you up to the border. Friend of mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop you right at the hospital.
CREASY: Got a thing I gotta do first.
FEMALE VOICE: Creasy wheels. There's Rosanna.
ROSANNA: A lot of people are looking for you.
CREASY: I guess that makes you the smart one.
ROSANNA: We're interested in the same thing. I'm writing a story.
ROSANNA: This might interest you. I found it across the street.
ROSANNA: It's Santa Muerte. Death worship. The religion of La Hermanidad. There's a curse on you.
CREASY: It's a little late. What are you going to do?
ROSANNA: What are you going to do?
ROSANNA: I can help. I have a situation Mr. Creasy. There is a brotherhood called Le Hermanidad which protects both high ranking Government officials, corrupt police, and organized crime at a level that is very difficult for me to touch. I believe you were a victim of this organization. You and this story may help to unmask them.
CREASY: Thank you.
PINTA'S ROOM: He stands there a moment. His pain entirely his own. And then he goes to Pinta's little desk, finds her school notebook buried in a pile. He flips through it until he The LICENSE PLATE NUMBER Pinta jotted for him. Then he notices the notebook is really a diary. Every page references her day to day relationship with Creasy. "I love you Creasy Bear." He hears soft footsteps. Creasy Lisa stands in the doorway in her nightgown, her eyes drilling through Creasy.
LISA: ( softly ) You let them take her. She loved you and you let them take her.
LISA: Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
CREASY: ( shrugs ) I was already dead.
CREASY: I want you to know something. I'm going to kill them. Anyone who opens their eyes at me.
LISA: He turns, but she doesn't look back at him.
LISA: Kill them, Creasy.
PINTA'S VOICE: Why Blue Bayou, Creasy? Is that where you're from?
CREASY: Blue Bayou is a dream, Pinta. Like you.
PINTA GHOST: Dreams are beautiful, Creasy-Bear, but life is better.
CREASY: ( smiles ) Why are you here?
PINTA GHOST: I have to watch you now.
RAYBURN: You'll be Stateside by suppertime.
CREASY: I'm going to need help, Ray.
RAYBURN: Fuck. Look at you; you won't last a day the shape you're in. Unless you stop bleeding you should have your spleen Yes or no?
CREASY: Yes or no?
RAYBURN: ( after a beat ) I won't kill again. Hunt people. I gave that up. Anything else? It's yours.
RAYBURN: Jesus, Creasy. You're talking war.
LOCATION: Fluorescents flicker on. A Fiat up on the hydraulic lift. A section of the garage is portioned off by heavy steel sheeting with a padlocked door. One of the two men unlocks it. Creasy and Rayburn enter.
PARTITION: Three long steel tables. Covered with weapons.
RAYBURN: Candy store. Every town in Mexico has one if you know what door to bang on.
CREASY: I'll take the .45 and the Webley .32.
RAYBURN: I know it's old fashioned, but it's reliable. Like us.
CREASY: I need less than standard packing. Can you knock up a case for fifteen of each?
CREASY: ( indicating ) Cut the stock here. The barrel here. Make sure you file it smooth. ( looks around ) Rocket launchers?
RAYBURN: Different door. Not far from here.
CREASY: Maybe I can help your situation and you So where do we begin?
ROSANNA: So where do we begin?
CREASY: I need the name and address of the owner of a Toyota Corolla, license number ME31704.We didn't get the last digit so I need the ten possible matches.
ROSANNA: So what do I get in return?
CREASY: Let's see how the relationship develops. I'll call you in the AM. Thanks.
MANZANO: He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.
ROSANNA: He sounded strong to me. Stronger than we are.
ROSANNA: Because he's outside. Because he's not tied to the same system we are.
MANZANO: We did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings, including the little girl. The same man 'The Dreamer'. Listen to this.
VOICE: "I used to run through the streets of Neza because I was scared of being fucked with. I swore one day I would cross the street walking. Now I walk."
ROSANNA: He's protected by La Hermanidad.
MANZANO: I know this. Your point?
ROSANNA: Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is he could be very valuable to us.
ROSANNA: Then what do you have to lose?
MANZANO: It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.
CREASY: ( incredulous ) Do you know who I am?
JORGE: ( incredulous ) Do you know who I am?
CREASY: You are Jorge Ramirez.
CREASY: Jorge starts the engine. As he eases out into traffic.
CREASY'S VOICE: Stop here. Turn off the ignition.
CREASY: Can you hear me?
CREASY: I am going to ask questions. If you don't answer, fully and truthfully, you will suffer much more than you have to.
CREASY: That's to cauterize the stubs.
JORGE: Do you know who I am?
CREASY: Who are you?
JORGE: I am the President of La Hermanidad.
JORGE'S VOICE: No! No!
JORGE: Stares at the stump of his right forefinger, smoke rising up off it. Creasy sticks the lighter back in its hole. And Creasy looking at him, devoid of emotion.
JORGE: Wh- wh- what do you want to know?
CREASY: The Ramos kidnapping. How did it work?
JORGE: I don't know. We were just given instructions to take her.
CREASY: Ordered by who?
JORGE: I don't know. I don't know! We work in parts. A voice calls in a kidnapping. We deliver the target to the guardians. We don't even know them. They might transfer to other guardians. The negotiators and the bosses don't even see the target. They just make the deal!
JORGE: ( a mile a minute ) I don't know! We work in parts. A voice calls in a kidnapping. We deliver the target to the guardians. We don't even know them. They might transfer to other guardians. The negotiators and the bosses don't even see the target. They just make the deal!
CREASY: Who ordered it?
JORGE: The cops call him 'The Dreamer'.
CREASY: Where do I find him?
JORGE: ( shrugs; terrified ) I don't know. No one knows.
JORGE: I don't know, I swear.
CREASY: ( after a beat ) I believe you.
JORGE: ( crying ) I'm professional. I just do my job.
CREASY: Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.
JORGE: He called me on the cell phone to set a time and location for the switch.
CREASY: Who's he?
JORGE: The one who transferred Pinta to their
CREASY: Who's he?
JORGE: I don't know, but I know his face.
JORGE: I see him sometimes at the handball court in Chapultepec on a Saturday afternoon.
CREASY: How do I recognize him.
JORGE: He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.
CREASY: In the next hour, where do I find your One-one-three Arco Iris. Third floor.
JORGE: One-one-three Arco Iris. Third floor.
GIRL: ( nods ) When will I see you again?
CREASY: Her name was Pinta.

CREASY'S VOICE: Roman's Chapter 13:21. Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good. There is no authority except from
GUARDIAN TWO: EXT. DOOR - SUNSET Guardian One stands at the slot. Creasy is pressed up against the wall out of sight. He holds the shotgun wrapped in a ragged beach towel. As the door unlocks and opens and Guardian One steps in, Creasy slides in right behind him.
CREASY: Tell me about the girl.
GUARDIAN ONE: Who the fuck's that?
CREASY: How does it work?
GUARDIAN TWO: Everything on the cellphone. We wait for calls. We have no number to call.
CREASY: Who pays you?
GUARDIAN TWO: We have an ATM bank card. We draw out 300 dollars every two weeks.
CREASY: What's the PIN number?
GUARDIAN TWO: The what?
CREASY: The number you use at the bank machine.
GUARDIAN TWO: Who killed her? You?
CREASY: Who killed her? You?
GUARDIAN TWO: Don't lie to me.
CREASY: Don't lie to me.
GUARDIAN TWO: The boss did or his brother.
CREASY: Who's the boss?
GUARDIAN TWO: We don't know! We never see his face! We have to wait in the other room. He was screaming to the girl that.
GUARDIAN TWO: .his nephew was killed in the exchange. And the money was stolen.
CREASY: What money?
GUARDIAN TWO: The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.
CREASY: Who's Tazinari?
GUARDIAN TWO: Head of the antikidnapping division. Show me.
CREASY: Show me.
FEMALE GUARDIAN: He was screaming about the money and his dead nephew. He threw the little girl against the wall.
FEMALE GUARDIAN: She fell. She wasn't moving. They threw her body in the trunk of the car and drove away. Who? Who's they?
CREASY: Who? Who's they?
FEMALE GUARDIAN: The boss's brother, I recognize his voice. It's high pitched. We call him Woody Woodpecker.
CREASY: Now listen to me. If you tell me where to find the boss. I will let you live.
FEMALE GUARDIAN: Please. I don't know.
THE HALLWAY: After the sound. He kicks open a door. There! In a 8' X 4' room. A 12-year-old GIRL. Bound and FLASHCUT: We think it's Pinta for a heartbeat, but it's EXT. GUARDIA DE SEGUIDAD - NIGHT A window to the left explodes as the room is enveloped in flames. The front door opens, a weird sight. Creasy exits holding both the 12-year-old's hand and the Female Guardian who's bound and blindfolded in her underwear. They walk straight at camera as flames shoot out of the roof. Creasy has set the place on fire. Creasy is on fire. And as they continue to walk towards us.
BLACK SCREEN: CREASY'S VOICE
CREASY'S VOICE: Roman chapter 13:7. Therefore whoever resists authority will bring judgement on themselves. Now it is time to awake out of sleep for our salvation is nearer than we first believed.
ROSANNA: Rosanna Guerrero.
CREASY'S VOICE: It's Creasy.
ROSANNA: Where are you?
CREASY'S VOICE: Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
ROSANNA: Last night. Do you know something?
CREASY'S VOICE: What was her name?
ROSANNA: Camila. Camila Valencias.
CREASY: The girl looks up at the name.
CREASY: ( into phone ) I've got her.
CREASY: I need something. Do you have banking I have connections.
ROSANNA: ( hesitates, then. ) I have connections.
CREASY: The PIN number is 4-7-4-7. I need to know whose account it is. Where do I find you?
ROSANNA: Where do I find you?
CREASY: I'll call you tomorrow.
CREASY: What do you know about the cop? Tazinari. The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos?
ROSANNA: He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit Where does he live?
CREASY: Where does he live?
ROSANNA: He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide.
CREASY: Give me the address.
ADJUTANT: Two in one day. And they died very badly. Sandri and Jorge were prime suspects in twelve kidnappings in the last six months.
MANZANO: Whoever did this was methodical, unafraid. Was Jorge's mugshot in the photos we showed Creasy?
ADJUTANT: No, I checked. But right after Sandri was shot, a girlfriend of his was found naked, hysterical in the street. She said it was a man fitting Creasy's description who shot him.
MANZANO: Mr. Creasy was, and maybe is again, a very lethal human being.
ADJUTANT: You don't seem very surprised?
MANZANO: What's surprising these days?
MANZANO: Your sister? Only a virgin cooks like Your man's here. Interrogation room two.
AGENT: ( laughs ) Your man's here. Interrogation room two.
SURVEILLANCE ROOM: Seen through a two-way mirror. Manzano watches as. Rayburn sits at a steel chair, bolted to the floor. Rayburn's eyes are closed. In meditation. Then, slowly, his arms extend out to the sides. Manzano is curious as, slower still, Rayburn extends both hands out in front of him, palms up. Must be a Zen thing. Then, both MIDDLE FINGERS are extended. With eyes still closed, Rayburn mouths 'fuck you'. Manzano bursts a INTERROGATION ROOM TWO Rayburn opens his eyes, looks over as Manzano enters. Still eating, he hands Rayburn a second plate of chicken.
MANZANO: Pollo Pibil. Chicken and chorizo sausage. Hmmmh. They marinate it in lemon and orange juice. It's a stew I already ate.
RAYBURN: ( sets it down ) I already ate.
MANZANO: Tell me about your friend Creasy.
RAYBURN: You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
MANZANO: I read the file. You and Creasy have seen quite a bit together.
RAYBURN: Two tourists who never went home.
MANZANO: You helped him get this job.
RAYBURN: That's what friends do.
MANZANO: Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not I can take care of myself.
RAYBURN: I can take care of myself.
MANZANO: You and Creasy both. A two man army according to Interpol. Panama. Lebanon with the Druze. Desert Storm. Where you were contracted by the U.S. Army to hunt down elite Iraqi military commanders. You two were a married couple.
RAYBURN: The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends.
MANZANO: What happened to him? What happened to
RAYBURN: None of your business. Or mine for that matter. I got nothing more to say.
MANZANO: This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does.
RAYBURN: He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.
MANZANO: I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead.
RAYBURN: Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead.
MANZANO: What was she to Creasy then?
RAYBURN: Light. At the end of a long, dark tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was alright to live again.
MANZANO: And they took that away.
RAYBURN: A man can be an artist in anything. Stone, paint, words. Food. Anything if his soul is true to it. Creasy's art is death. And he's about to paint his
RAYBURN: Me? I got Jap businessmen to drive across the border. So, if you'll do me a favor and let me the fuck out of here.
MANZANO: Is it true? Creasy saved the little girl that was kidnapped yesterday.
ROSANNA: And left three more dead men.
MANZANO: When you talked to him, did he look sane?
ROSANNA: No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.
MANZANO: I think he's. magnificent. You only fuck me to get information.
MANZANO: ( smiles ) You only fuck me to get information.
ROSANNA: ( smiles back ) You only give information so you can fuck A beautiful circle.
MANZANO: A beautiful circle.
ROSANNA: Let's put Creasy to press. There's a vigilante cleaning up Mexico. An unstoppable hero.
ROSANNA: And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.
MANZANO: ( as he takes card ) I should start going for your tits first.
CREASY: I'm not here to hurt you. I need to borrow your house and your car. Are you the proud owners of the Coupe deVille?
MERCEDES: The door closes with an hermetic whump. The two cars pull away toward the opening FRONT GATES.
CREASY: If you promise to speak softly and not to shout, I won't have to tape your mouths.
CREASY: Did you know you have a dishonest policeman living in your neighborhood?
OLD MAN: I know of you. You're the American. The bodyguard who's killing the kidnapper.
OLD MAN: In the church, they say to forgive.
CREASY: Forgiveness is between them and God. It's my job to arrange the meeting.
CREASY: Do you have an old blanket you don't care about? I don't want to burn that wall.
CREASY: A 'Man On Fire' strides through the smoke and dust. A shotgun at his side and a Molotov cocktail in his left Without missing a stride he unloads both barrels into the drivers window. A scary prospect even though it's bullet- proof. The lit Molotov explodes beneath the car. Silence. Then a dull impact explosion. 30 feet of flames envelope the car. The driver and Tazinari both prisoners inside their own car. The driver exits releasing a full clip from his Uzi. Creasy nails him with a single shot to the head. Tazinari exits through the flames hands high in the air.
CREASY: You know where you are?
CREASY: Under the bridge. Where the deal went south. Now why don't you tell me what went down?
TAZINARI: Do you know who I am? I am the commandante of the Judicial anti- kidnapping division.
CREASY: And one of the founding members of La
TAZINARI: Creasy pulls the buck knife from his pocket, flips it open. As Tazinari reacts, Creasy spins him round, slits his clothes up from ankle to neck. The cloth drops away, some hanging at Tazinari's wrists. Tazinari has a sudden loss of attitude.
DELIVERANCE ): Creasy rips down his Calvins. CU of Tazinari's face winces with either pain or extreme discomfort.
CREASY: That's not my dick. That's the barrel of your own gun. Shoved up your own ass.
TAZINARI: Please, don't.
CREASY: It's all up to you, commandante. Tell me about you and 'The Dreamer'.
TAZINARI: I don't know him. I saw the opportunity and got lucky.
CREASY: Lucky how?
TAZINARI: That he used policemen. That you killed them, it made it a police matter. The Ramos family couldn't refuse our And I had my men ready.
CREASY: And I had my men ready.
TAZINARI: And I had my men ready.
CREASY: You stole the drop.
TAZINARI: Yes. Many times.
CREASY: O.K. So tell me more.
TAZINARI: There was no ten million dollars.
CREASY: The ransom was ten.
TAZINARI: Two and a half. That's how much there Don't lie to me!
CREASY: Don't lie to me!
TAZINARI: Two and a half! The rest was paper! Strips of paper! Maybe your men stole from you.
CREASY: Maybe your men stole from you.
TAZINARI: No. Whoever took the rest took it before the exchange.
CREASY: Who gave the bags to Ramos?
TAZINARI: His lawyer. Jordan Kalfus.
TAZINARI: That's all I know! Please. I'm sorry for the girl. But it was business! I'm a professional.
CREASY: That's what everybody keeps saying.
UNDERWATER: CLOSE UP of Jordan face down. We glimpse what we don't want to see. Black holes where his eyes and mouth were. His ears missing. Creasy not terribly impressed. Just pissed that he's Creasy on a cell phone talking to Rosanna
CREASY: Another favor. get me banking info on Jordan Kalfus. U.S. deposits or withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the same on Samuel Ramos.
ROSANNA: How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info.
CREASY: You don't, I'll call you. Oh! I have a tape recording that I am sure will interest you.
CREASY: ( to Samuel ) I'm going to talk to your wife. If you move or say one word, I'll kill you.
CREASY: I'm going to tell you a story. Your lawyer is dead. Someone didn't want him talking. Last week he wired $2.5 million into his U.S. bank account. Colonel Ernesto Tazinari is also dead. He hijacked the ransom drop, another $2.5 million. If my arithmetic is correct it means $5 million remains.
CREASY: Your husband magically had five million deposited in a U.S. bank account last
CREASY: They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.
LISA: Planned what?
CREASY: An autosequestra. Kalfus arranged for Pinta to be taken to a safehouse. I'm sure he thought she'd sit there for three days eating pizza and watching TV. It didn't work out that way. Everything got fucked up when I killed the cops and Tazinari saw an opportunity.
CREASY: On the surface it was low risk and high return. This was the third autosequestra Jordan had organized for clients. The other two succeeded.
SAMUEL: Our lifestyle was in jeopardy. My pain and weakness only fueled your anger and determination. I wasn't sure about whether to go through with it or not. Then I woke up one day and it was done. Jordan was supposed to take care of it. A bullet does not lie. A bullet tells the truth. And the truth will set you
CREASY: A bullet does not lie. A bullet tells the truth. And the truth will set you
CREASY: In many ways I think this bullet should be shared between you and Lisa.
PINTA'S VOICE: From the backseat I can see Creasy's eyes in the mirror. He watches and thinks. He never smiles. I wish I was back in the front seat with him. I wish he would
CREASY: ROSANNA'S VOICE
ROSANNA'S VOICE: CUT TO:
ROSANNA: I traced the PIN. I have an address for you. But I need to see you.
CREASY: I show, you give me the information?
ROSANNA: INT. AFI OPERATIONS CENTER - NIGHT Back on Rosanna. We see she's sitting in the AFI Operations Center amongst Technicians, surveillance and listening devices, and Manzano. We can hear the interior of a family house, kids, a frustrated mother, a Mexican soap playing in the B.G., over speakers.
CREASY: INT. AFI OPERATIONS CENTER - NIGHT Back on Rosanna. We see she's sitting in the AFI Operations Center amongst Technicians, surveillance and listening devices, and Manzano. We can hear the interior of a family house, kids, a frustrated mother, a Mexican soap playing in the B.G., over speakers.
TECHNICIAN: ( to Manzano ) We got the whole place wiretapped. But no males that sound anything like 'The He'll show. Who's that?
MANZANO: He'll show. Who's that?
ROSANNA: Who's that?
MANZANO: He's the man, 'the Boss?' My guys got into the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots. We had to inject the whole Barrio. We bugged the house and stole the picture of him. Manzano looks at Rosanna. Now's the time to really pressure him. Lets publish his picture in tomorrow's edition.
ROSANNA: So how are going to recipricate?
CUT TO: INT. ROSANNA'S APARTMENT Rosanna in her apartment in the dark. A tear trails her CU of the proofsheet of the next day's newspaper. The Boss' picture, full frame.
CREASY: I'm looking for Rosanna Guerrero.
OWNER: This way.
MANZANO: ( holds up paper ) Hombre en fuego. Man On Fire. That's what the papers have named you.
CREASY: It's what you and Rosanna named me. Sit, Creasy. Everything that happens from now on does so with my permission. Really. You won't find a better carne asada in all of Mexico.
MANZANO: Sit, Creasy. Everything that happens from now on does so with my permission. Really. You won't find a better carne asada in all of Mexico.
MANZANO: ( laughs at himself ) The last few days may represent the best police work of my life.
CREASY: What do you want?
MANZANO: The same thing as you. Except, my reach isn't as long as yours. My father was a policemen, did you know that?
CREASY: I don't know shit about you.
MANZANO: He was one of the original founders of 'Le Hermanidad' in the days when it represented good not evil.
MANZANO: He was murdered. And now here I am. Trying to honor his memory. Hamstrung by bureaucracy and corruption. The organization that he began now protects criminals at the highest level where I would need a Presidential finding in order to expose it.or you.
MANZANO: My family lives in Miami. Because of the death threats.
CREASY: It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
MANZANO: It galls me to watch you. You can do as much in days as I can in years. Men like the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.
CREASY: Are you going to arrest me or talk me to
MANZANO: My country needs justice. Proper justice. Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. They need to be brought to trial. Dealt with Then people will respect the law. When they see it works.
CREASY: So you are going to talk me to death.
MANZANO: You walk out and deal justice. You're what I wish I could be. The policemen who kills you, his family will have all they want.
CREASY: Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
MANZANO: I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys were up to something. Are you two No, but I have to admit I thought about Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
CREASY: My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys were up to something. Are you two No, but I have to admit I thought about Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
MANZANO: No, but I have to admit I thought about Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
CREASY: Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
MANZANO: You have no interest in making things easy, do you?
CREASY: I'm not. easy.
MANZANO: Percodan. I imagine you need handfuls by
MANZANO: Account belongs to a woman we think is The Dreamer's girlfriend. Reina Rosas, who is 8 months pregnant.
MANZANO: The plan is the girlfriend will lead you to the Boss. You'll lead me, and I'll arrest him. Agreed? I'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances.
MANZANO: ( Creasy turns ) I'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances.
CREASY: Off the top of my head, I don't know what they could've been.
BLACK SCREEN: CREASY'S VOICE
CREASY'S VOICE: Romans chapter 13:4 - therefore whoever resists authority will bring judgment on themselves. Now it is time to awake out of sleep for our salvation is nearer than we first believed.
GROUND LEVEL: CREASY sits up as a car pulls up, and a MAN gets out. Creasy checks the digital "8x10" even though this face is indelibly imprinted on his brain. It's not "The Dreamer." Not as handsome, but there's a The MAN unlocks the front door, checks the street first and then enters. Creasy regroups mentally and physically. Checks the magazine in his SIG SAUER. Chambers rounds into his shotgun. Looks up and sees a six-year-old on a bicycle approach the front door. A ten-year-old opens the door from inside. The six-year-old struggles to get his bicycle through the doorway. Creasy moves. He holds the shotgun against his leg as he strides across the street. "Man on Fire." The bicycle makes it in. And the door is closing. Creasy gets a foot in, forces his way inside.
VOICE: He's inside. What should we do?
MANZANO: ( keys mic ) Do nothing.
LIVING ROOM: Creasy faces Reina, heavily pregnant. Silence. Two other kids hide behind her. Suddenly the wall next to Creasy explodes in a hail of bullets. We realize Creasy caught one round in the chest. He's down on one knee. uses the shotgun as a crutch. Reina is screaming. Hear a door torn open. Creasy moves to the sound. A MAN has run out the back.
THE MAN: Ducks down. windshield shatters from the blast of Creasy's shotgun. Bug slams into wall. The Man rolls out. using the door as a shield.
BARRIO: The Man flees into a labyrinth of packing-crate houses on car-tire foundations out into street. Running hard, too hard for Creasy in his condition. He is losing a lot of blood. He stops.
CREASY: Behind the wheel of the Volkswagon, roars out chasing.
BARRIO: Creasy, shotgun in one hand, the injured Man in the other. walks through the barrio. a small crowd is yelling, "Creasy, MAN ON FIRE" ( in Spanish: Hombre en Fuego ).
CREASY: Reina Rosas.
REINA: How do you contact 'the Boss'?
CREASY: How do you contact 'the Boss'?
REINA: We page him and he calls back on this cell phone.
CREASY: What is his name?
REINA: Daniel what?
CREASY: Daniel what?
REINA: Daniel Rosas Sanchez.
CREASY: So you're married to him? And this looks remarkably like his brother.
CREASY: What is his name?
REINA: Aurillio Rosas Sanchez.
TECHNICIAN: What do we do?
AFI GROUP: congregating around maps, and a "Triggerfish," a means of tracing the location of a cell phone.
CREASY: Hello Daniel. I've got your family and I want to negotiate.
DANIEL: Mr. Creasy. What do you want?
CREASY: I want you. How much do you want?
DANIEL: How much do you want?
CREASY: It's non-negotiable.
DANIEL: Two million U.S.. Three million U.S.?
CREASY: I told you, non-negotiable.
AFI TRAILER: MANZANO listening.
MANZANO: CUT TO:
LIVING ROOM: Cell phone ringing.
CREASY: Daniel has a different attitude, a lot more amenable. He tries to speak to Creasy very logically about a very illogical subject.
DANIEL: The most important thing in life is family. And there you are. You have my family. What do you want?
CREASY: I want you.
DANIEL: This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where
CREASY: ( interrupts ) Your brother wants to talk to you.
AURILLIO: BOOM! Creasy shoots Aurillio in his right kneecap. As Aurillio HOWLS in agony.
CREASY: Listen to me. Listen! I'm going to take your family apart piece by piece.
REINA: Under the sink. We have money under the sink. Six million dollars. It's wet but
CREASY: ( silence )
DANIEL: Listen! I will give you a life for a What do you mean?
CREASY: What do you mean?
DANIEL: Her life for your life.
CREASY: Whose life?
DANIEL: The girl's. Pinta's.
CREASY: You're a liar. Pinta's dead.
DANIEL: I'm a businessman. A dead girl is worth nothing. She is alive.
CREASY: I want proof of life. What did she call her bear?
DANIEL: Creasy. She calls the bear 'Creasy Okay. Where?
CREASY: Okay. Where?
TEAM LEADER: We received enough of a signal to at least put him in the Zona Colonia. Shit not enough time. He hung up.
CREASY: Lisa, don't hang up on me. Pinta is
LISA: ( silence ) I don't believe you.
CREASY: I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction. In 45 minutes.
LISA: You're lying. I don't believe you.
CREASY: Then don't come.
LISA: Creasy. Wait.
CREASY: Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.
CREASY: Pinta. Pinta.
PINTA: I love you, Creasy. And you love me,
MANZANO: I'm your chauffeur now, Creasy. All units. Commence the operation. Repeat. Commence.
MANZANO: All units. Commence the operation. Repeat. Commence.
MANZANO: Creasy? Creasy?
MANZANO: Goddamn you.
MANZANO: ( keys mic ) Hold at the perimeter. Until I enter.
