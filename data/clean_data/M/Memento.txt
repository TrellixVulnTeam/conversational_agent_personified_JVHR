LEONARD: Looks like somebody's home. Teddy looks from Leonard to the pickup and back.
TEDDY: That thing's been here for years. Leonard gets out of the Jaguar and moves to the pickup. He inspects it with a methodical, practiced eye. Teddy follows.
LEONARD: I think you're wrong. These tracks aren't more than a few days old. Leonard opens the door of the pickup and searches the interior. On the dirty vinyl of the passenger seat he finds six BULLETS. Leonard picks two of them up and studies them. He drops them onto the dashboard then SHUTS the door. Let's take a look inside. Leonard walks towards the house, patting his jacket pockets. Teddy leans on the pickup, uneasy, watching Leonard.
"KILL HIM": LEONARD ( V.0. ) I've finally found him. How long have I been looking? Leonard stuffs the Polaroids back into his pocket, reaches around to the back of his waistband and draws a HANDGUN, keeping it out of Teddy's line of sight. Teddy enters, wary.
TEDDY: Find anything? Didn't think so, let's go, Leonard neither replies nor turns around. Teddy, worried, affects a casual air, shrugging dismissively, Fuck this. Teddy turns and heads for the door. Leonard LEAPS on him, pistol-whipping him furiously as he shouts:
LEONARD: YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU DID! YOU BEG FORGIVENESS, THEN YOU PAY! Teddy is down. Leonard DRAGS him back, deeper into the dark house. Leonard is in a frenzy. He dumps Teddy at the end of the hall and stands over him. Teddy SPITS BLOOD.
TEDDY: You don't have a clue, you freak. Leonard crouches down and grabs Teddy by the lapels.
LEONARD: Beg my forgiveness! Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.
TEDDY: Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.
LEONARD: ( triumphant smile ) MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99
TEDDY: You read it off your fucking photo. You don't know me, you don't even know who you are.
LEONARD: I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Francisco and I'm -
TEDDY: ( bloody grin ) That's who you were, you don't know who you are.
LEONARD: Shut your mouth!
TEDDY: Lemme take you down in the basement and show you what you've become. Teddy gestures towards the basement door, in pain, but enjoying Leonard's growing anxiety. C'mon, Lenny - we'll take a look down there together. Then you'll know. You'll know what you really are. Leonard glances fearfully at the door, then looks at Teddy. He THRUSTS the barrel of his gun into Teddy's mouth and WE ARE AT THE SHOT FROM THE END OF THE OPENING SEQUENCE. Teddy panics, shaking his head, trying to talk around the metal, but GAGS just as Leonard pulls the trigger. A SHOT rings out as we -
BURT: That guy's here already. Burt TAPS the POLAROID PHOTOGRAPH of Teddy which is sitting on the counter. Leonard picks up the photo and turns to see Teddy APPROACHING the glass door of the office. Leonard watches carefully as Teddy shambles up to the office door. A BELL CHIIIES as Teddy enters and breaks into his shit-eating grin. Leonard slips the photo into his pocket.
TEDDY: Leonard nods in apparent recognition, wary.
LEONARD: It's Leonard. like I told you before. Teddy pretends to think hard.
TEDDY: Did you? I musta forgot. I'm Teddy.
LEONARD: ( smiles ) I guess I've told you about my condition. Teddy grins and holds the door open for Leonard.
TEDDY: Only every time I see ya! MEMENTO Pink Revision - 9/7/99
LEONARD: My car. Teddy glances back in surprise.
TEDDY: This is your car.
LEONARD: ( shakes head ) You're in a playful mood. Leonard holds up a Polaroid of a late model JAGUAR. LEONARD ( cont'd ) Shouldn't make fun of somebody's Teddy smiles and heads for the BRAND-NEW JAGUAR parked several cars further down.
TEDDY: Just trying to have a little fun.
TEDDY: Roll your window up, will ya? Leonard hits his window button. A few fragments of safety glass rise out of the door, remnants of a broken window.
LEONARD: It's broken. Teddy looks, curious.
TEDDY: I can get that fixed for you. Leonard shrugs. So where are we going, Sherlock?
LEONARD: I got a lead on a place. Leonard checks the note, then hands it to Teddy.
TEDDY: ( surprised at the note ) What the hell you want to go there for?
LEONARD: You know it?
TEDDY: Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building. Why are we going there?
LEONARD: ( smiling ) I don't remember.
LEONARD: Looks like somebody's home.
"SHAVE": Leonard pulls the note off, studying it carefully.
"KILL HIM": He sticks the photo of Teddy BETWEEN HIS TEETH as he holds his HANDGUN up and checks that it is loaded. He sticks the GUN in the back of his waistband, the PHOTO in his jacket pocket, slings the POLAROID CAMERA over his shoulder.
BURT: I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.
LEONARD: I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.
BURT: What can I do for you, Leonard?
LEONARD: I'm sorry. um. ?
BURT: Burt, I'm not sure, but I may have asked you to hold my calls -
LEONARD: Burt, I'm not sure, but I may have asked you to hold my calls -
BURT: You don't know?
LEONARD: I think I may have. I'm not good on the You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. Don't you That's the thing. I have this condition.
BURT: ( nods ) You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. Don't you That's the thing. I have this condition.
LEONARD: That's the thing. I have this condition.
BURT: I have no memory.
LEONARD: I have no memory.
BURT: No. It's different. I have no short-term memory. I know who I am and all about myself, but since my injury I can't make any new memories. Everything fades. If we talk for too long, I'll forget how we started. I don't know if we've ever met before, and the next time I see you I won't remember this conversation. So if I seem strange or rude, that's probably. He notices that Burt is staring at him as if he were an exotic insect. I've told you this before, haven't I?
LEONARD: No. It's different. I have no short-term memory. I know who I am and all about myself, but since my injury I can't make any new memories. Everything fades. If we talk for too long, I'll forget how we started. I don't know if we've ever met before, and the next time I see you I won't remember this conversation. So if I seem strange or rude, that's probably. He notices that Burt is staring at him as if he were an exotic insect. I've told you this before, haven't I?
BURT: ( nods ) I don't mean to mess with you. It's just so weird. You don't remember me at all, and we talked a bunch of times. Leonard shrugs. BURT ( cont'd ) What's the last thing you remember?
LEONARD: My wife.
BURT: ( fascinated ) What's it like?
LEONARD: Like waking. Like you always just woke That must suck. All. backwards. Leonard raises his eyebrows in enquiry. Well, like.. you gotta pretty good idea of what you're gonna do next, but no idea what you just did. I'm the exact opposite.
BURT: That must suck. All. backwards. Leonard raises his eyebrows in enquiry. Well, like.. you gotta pretty good idea of what you're gonna do next, but no idea what you just did. I'm the exact opposite.
LEONARD: ( focuses on Burt ) How long have I been here?
BURT: Couple days.
LEONARD: So you're holding my calls?
BURT: As requested. Leonard reaches into his pocket and pulls out his Polaroids
LEONARD: Okay, but this guy's an exception. Leonard places the Polaroid of Teddy on the counter in front of Burt. Burt looks at it. Know this guy?
BURT: Your friend, right?
LEONARD: What makes you think he's my friend?
BURT: Seen you together, that's all.
LEONARD: He's not my friend, Burt. But if he calls, or if he turns up here, then you give me a call in my room, okay?
BURT: Sure. But nobody else, right?
LEONARD: Just this guy. Leonard indicates the Polaroid of Teddy. I hope my condition won't be a problem for you.
BURT: Not if you remember to pay your bill. Leonard smiles and reaches into his wallet. E.C.U. of fingers rifling bills in a wallet. Leonard counts out some money and hands it to Burt. Burt takes the money, spotting something over Leonard's shoulder. That guy's here already. Burt TAPS the POLAROID PHOTOGRAPH of Teddy which is sitting on the counter. Leonard picks up the photo and turns to see Teddy APPROACHING the glass door of the office.
SEQUENCE##: Leonard enters, sees a WHITE PAPER BAG on the counter by the sink. On the bag is a handwritten message:
"SHAVE THIGH": Leonard looks into the bag, then pulls out a can of SHAVING FOAM, and a pack of DISPOSABLE RAZORS. He runs the hot water, steps back and lifts his foot onto the sink. He is awkward and uncomfortable. He notices an ICE BUCKET by the sink.
WAITER: Sir? You left these at your table. Leonard looks down. The waiter hands him a BROWN ENVELOPE and a MOTEL ROOM KEY ( DISCOUNT INN, ROOM 304 ). On the envelope is a handwritten message:
LEONARD: Thanks. Lincoln Street? The Waiter glances at his Polaroid.
WAITER: You wanna go east on sixth. Just keep straight, all the way out of town, then take a right. MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99
TEDDY: Mr Gammell?
LEONARD: Mr Gammell?
TEDDY: Lenny, is that you?
LEONARD: John Gammell?
TEDDY: Lenny, it's Teddy. Look, stay there, okay? I'm gonna be right over.
LEONARD: I'll be waiting. Leonard hangs up, thinking. He looks at the writing on the back of his hand, then pulls back his sleeve to reveal the words:
"KILL HIM": Leonard sticks the photo of Teddy BETWEEN HIS TEETH as he holds his HANDGUN up and checks that it is loaded. He sticks the GUN in the back of his waistband.
LEONARD: Who is this? He unbuttons his shirt. And we spoke earlier? I don't remember Well, yeah, but it's not amnesia. I remember everything from before my injury, I just can't make any new Leonard pulls his shirt off. There is a BANDAGE on his LEFT ARM. He looks do at the TATTOOS ALL OVER HIS CHEST, STOMACH
LEONARD: Leonard slips into the seat opposite her. Natalie is pretty, but has bruising around one eye, and a mark on her lip.
NATALIE: You don't remember me.
LEONARD: ( friendly smile ) Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition -
NATALIE: You did explain, Lenny. Leonard shifts uncomfortably.
LEONARD: Please call me Leonard. My wife called me You told me. Leonard raises his eyebrows, then smiles.
NATALIE: You told me. Leonard raises his eyebrows, then smiles.
LEONARD: Then I probably told you how much I hated it. Could you take off your sunglasses? It's just hard for me - Natalie takes them off to reveal her bruises.
NATALIE: So you have information for me?
LEONARD: So you have information for me?
NATALIE: Is that what your little note says?
LEONARD: Must be tough living life according to a few scraps of paper. Mix up your laundry list and your grocery list, you'll be eating your underwear. Natalie smiles. But I guess that's why you got those freaky tattoos. Leonard is surprised.
NATALIE: Must be tough living life according to a few scraps of paper. Mix up your laundry list and your grocery list, you'll be eating your underwear. Natalie smiles. But I guess that's why you got those freaky tattoos. Leonard is surprised.
LEONARD: It is tough. Almost impossible. I'm sorry I can't remember you. It's not personal. Natalie's smile fades.
NATALIE: I'm sorry. She takes a BROWN ENVELOPE out of her handbag. I do have information for you. You gave me a license plate number? I had my friend at the DMV trace it. Guess what name came up. Leonard shrugs.
LEONARD: You know him?
NATALIE: No. But the photo on his license looked familiar. I think he's been in the bar before Natalie slides the envelope towards him, but stops short. This is a copy of his registration, license, photo and all. Are you sure you want this?
LEONARD: Have I told you what this man did?
NATALIE: Then you shouldn't have to ask.
LEONARD: Then you shouldn't have to ask.
NATALIE: But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.
LEONARD: ( annoyed ) So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo. ( calms ) The world doesn't disappear when you close your eyes, does it? My actions still have meaning, even if I can't remember them. My wife deserves vengeance, and it doesn't make any difference whether I know about it.
NATALIE: Tell me about her again.
LEONARD: Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
NATALIE: Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
LEONARD: She was beautiful. Perfect to me -
NATALIE: Don't just recite the words. Close your eyes, remember her. Leonard smiles and shuts his eyes.
NATALIE: I wrote an address in there, too. Might be useful. It's this abandoned place outside of town. I guy I know used to use it for his bigger deals.
LEONARD: It's isolated.
NATALIE: It's isolated.
LEONARD: Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
NATALIE: I wasn't helping you for money.
LEONARD: ( CONTINUED ) It's not your fault. See, you have this NATALIE ( cont'd ) Are you still at the Discount Inn? Room 304? You left this at my place.
NATALIE: It's not your fault. See, you have this Leonard smiles. Natalie reaches into her purse and pulls out a MOTEL ROOM KEY. Are you still at the Discount Inn? Room 304? You left this at my place. Leonard pulls out a Polaroid of the Discount Inn.
LEONARD: The Discount Inn, yeah. Natalie leaves the key and gets up from the table.
NATALIE: They treating you alright?
LEONARD: ( smiling ) Don't remember.
NATALIE: You know what we have in common? Leonard shrugs. We're both survivors. Take care, Leonard. Leonard watches Natalie leave. He sits at the table, looking down at the BROWN ENVELOPE and the MOTEL ROOM KEY ( ROOM 304 ). Leonard rises, and heads to the restroom.
LEONARD: I met Sammy through work. Insurance. I was an investigator. I'd investigate claims to see which ones were phony. Leonard dips the razor into the steaming ice bucket. I had to see through people's bullshit. It was useful experience, because now it's my life. When I meet someone, I don't even know if I've met them before. I have to look in their eyes and just figure them out. My job taught me that the best way to find out what someone knew was to let them talk.
LEONARD: I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, But I've misplaced my key.
BURT: ( looks up ) Hi, Leonard. Burt puts his magazine down and gets up, sighing. BURT ( cont'd ) Probably in the room.
LEONARD: I don't see my key. Burt looks up. He REALIZES something.
BURT: Shit. Wrong room.
LEONARD: Burt tries to SHEPHERD Leonard out of the room.
BURT: This isn't your room. You're in 304. I Fucked up.
LEONARD: This isn't my room?
BURT: No, let's go.
LEONARD: Then why is this my handwriting? Leonard picks a WHITE PAPER BAG up off the floor. Handwritten on the side is a message:
"SHAVE THIGH": LEONARD ( cont'd ) Better tell me what the fuck's going on. Burt looks uncomfortable.
BURT: This was your room. You're up in 304 now.
LEONARD: When was I in here?
BURT: Last week. Then I rented you another one On top of this.
LEONARD: Business is slow. I told my boss about You, about your condition. He told me to Try and rent you another room.
BURT: Business is slow. I told my boss about You, about your condition. He told me to Try and rent you another room.
LEONARD: Why didn't you clean it out?
BURT: ( shrugs ) You're still paying for it. It's still Your room. Leonard shakes his head, smiling.
LEONARD: So how many rooms am I checked into in this dump?
BURT: Just two. So far. Leonard walks out past Burt.
LEONARD: Well, at least you're being honest about cheating me.
BURT: Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, You don't have to be that honest, Burt.
LEONARD: You don't have to be that honest, Burt.
BURT: Leonard turns. Burt grins.
LEONARD: I'm gonna write that down. Leonard fishes a piece of paper out of his pocket. There is a message on it which he reads. It says:
INFO": Leonard looks up at Burt.
LEONARD: I'd just become an investigator when I came across Sammy. Mr Samuel R. Jankis - strangest case ever. Guy's 58, semi- retired accountant. He and his wife had been in this car accident. nothing too serious, but he's acting funny - he can't get a handle on what's going on.
MRS JANKIS: Sammy looks up, worried. Mrs Jankis smiles at him. Sammy pushes the plunger, withdraws the needle and presses the swab against the skin, lookinq into Mrs Jankis' eyes and smiling back.
SEQUENCE##: Mrs. Jankis opens the front door to Leonard. Leonard shakes hands with Sammy, who smiles at him in apparent recognition.
LEONARD: His wife has to do everything. Sammy can only do simple stuff. He couldn't pick up any new skills at all, and that's how I got him.
TEDDY: Lenny! I thought you'd gone for good. What brings you back? Leonard looks at Teddy, sizing him up.
LEONARD: Unfinished business. What made you think I wasn't coming back?
TEDDY: You said you were leaving town.
LEONARD: Things change.
TEDDY: So I see. It's good to see you. My name's Guess I've told you about my condition.
LEONARD: Guess I've told you about my condition.
TEDDY: ( grins ) Only every time I see ya! Come on, I'll buy you lunch.
TEDDY: Not hungry?
LEONARD: ( shrugs ) It's my condition. I never know if I've already eaten, so I always just eat small You don't have to remember to be hungry.
TEDDY: You don't have to remember to be hungry.
LEONARD: It's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
TEDDY: Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he's here, right?
LEONARD: The guy you're looking for, Johnny G. That's why you haven't left. Am I right? Leonard shrugs. Teddy licks his fingers and frowns. Leonard, you need to be very careful.
TEDDY: The guy you're looking for, Johnny G. That's why you haven't left. Am I right? Leonard shrugs. Teddy licks his fingers and frowns. Leonard, you need to be very careful.
LEONARD: Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay?
TEDDY: Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay?
LEONARD: Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay?
TEDDY: Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.
LEONARD: ( CONTINUED ) 44 CONTINUED: ( 2 ) 44 Because you're relying on them alone. You Don't remember what you've discovered or how. Your notes might be unreliable.
TEDDY: Because you're relying on them alone. You Don't remember what you've discovered or how. Your notes might be unreliable.
LEONARD: Memory's unreliable. Teddy snorts. No, really. Memory's not perfect. It's not even that good. Ask the police, eyewitness testimony is unreliable. The cops don't catch a killer by sitting around remembering stuff. They collect facts, make notes, draw conclusions. Facts, not memories: that's how you investigate. I know, it's what I used to do. Memory can change the shape of a room or the color of a car. It's an interpretation, not a record. Memories can be changed or distorted and they're irrelevant if you have the facts.
TEDDY: You really want to find this guy?
LEONARD: He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.
TEDDY: You're living.
LEONARD: Just for revenge. That's what keeps me going. It's all I have. Teddy considers this.
TEDDY: We'll find him. Where are you staying? Leonard reaches into his pocket and takes out a Polaroid.
LEONARD: Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key.
TEDDY: Probably left it in your room. MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
LEONARD: I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, but I've misplaced my key.
BURT: ( looks up ) Hi, Leonard.
LEONARD: So Sammy can't learn any new skills. But I find something in my research: Conditioning. Sammy should still be able to learn through repetition. It's how you learn stuff like riding a bike, things you don't think about, you just get better through practice. Call it muscle memory, whatever, but it's a completely different part of the brain from the short-term memory. So I have the doctors test Sammy's response to 48 INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY ##BLACK AND WHITE SEQUENCE## 48 Sammy sits at a table. A DOCTOR sits opposite pointing out various METAL OBJECTS sitting on the table.
DOCTOR: Just pick up any three objects.
SAMMY: ( amused ) That's a test? Where were you guys when I did my CPA?
DOCTOR: It's a test, Sammy.
LEONARD: They kept repeating the test, always with the same objects electrified. The point was to see if he could learn to avoid the electrified objects. Not by memory, but by instinct.
LEONARD: Sorry. It's only me. Leonard FLOPS down. Natalie wakes up fully and relaxes.
NATALIE: Sleep okay?
LEONARD: Yeah. You? Natalie shrugs. She looks at her bedside clock.
NATALIE: I gotta be someplace. She gets out of bed, wearing pajamas. Leonard swings his legs out of the bed and realizes that he is wearing trousers and socks. He looks at his tattoos, as if he has never seen them Pretty weird. She is smiling at him in the mirror. Leonard smiles, shrugs.
LEONARD: Useful. You never write a phone number on your hand?
NATALIE: ( through mirror ) I should be able to talk to my friend about the license plate today.
LEONARD: Yeah, the license plate.
NATALIE: ( smiles ) John G's license plate number. You have it tattooed on your thigh. Natalie leaves the room. Leonard pulls down his trousers to reveal two tattoos:
NATALIE: If it's registered in this state it'll just take seconds to pull up his license and registration. I'll call when I've spoken to him.
LEONARD: Why don't we just arrange a meeting now? I'm not too good on the phone. Natalie takes her eye pencil and writes a NOTE on a SMALL BAG FROM A PHARMACY. Leonard puts his jacket on. Natalie offers him the note. It says:
NATALIE: ( smiles ) I'm helping you because you helped me. Leonard nods. NATALIE ( cont'd ) So will you remember me next time you seo Leonard shakes his head and reaches for the note. Natalie grabs his lapel and pulls him down to her, kissing him gently on the mouth. NATALIE ( cont'd ) I think you will.
LEONARD: ( smiles ) I'm sorry. Leonard heads for the door.
NATALIE: ( amused ) Lenny, before you go, can I have my shirt back please? She tosses him his blue shirt. Leonard looks down at the white shirt which he has put on. It is way too small.
TEDDY: Lenny! I thought you'd gone for good. What brings you back?
LEONARD: They kept testing Sammy for months, always with the same objects carrying the electrical charge.
SAMMY: Ah! What the fuck?!
DOCTOR: It's a test, Sammy.
SAMMY: Ah! What the fuck?!
DOCTOR: It's a test, Sammy.
SAMMY: Yeah? Test this you fucking quack. Sequence of JUMP CUTS of Sammy extending his MIDDLE FINGER and RECOILING in shock from the objects.
LEONARD: It was enough to suggest his condition was psychological not physical.
LEONARD: Natalie, right? Natalie nods, wary of Leonard's barely concealed anger. Leonard thrusts a Polaroid photo in her face. Who the fuck is Dodd? The photo is of a MAN who is BOUND, GAGGED, and BLOODY. On the back of the photo:
NATALIE: Guess I don't have to worry about him Who is he? What have you got me into? Natalie looks up and down the street.
LEONARD: ( snaps ) Who is he? What have you got me into? Natalie looks up and down the street.
NATALIE: Come inside.
NATALIE: Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!
LEONARD: That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!
NATALIE: Leonard, you offered to help when you saw what this guy did to me. She gestures at the BRUISING on her face.
LEONARD: How do I know he did that to you?
NATALIE: I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
LEONARD: So I just take your word?
NATALIE: ( sighs ) Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
LEONARD: ( sighs ) Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
NATALIE: Did you?
LEONARD: Kill him.
NATALIE: Kill him.
LEONARD: Course not. Natalie waves the Polaroid at him.
NATALIE: This has nothing to do with you. You helped me out, and I'm grateful. She tries to rip the picture. Leonard watches her try. The plastic is too strong.
LEONARD: You have to burn them. Natalie scrunches it up and throws it down. Leonard and Natalie sit down on the couch.
NATALIE: You decided to help me. Trust yourself. Trust your own judgment. You can question everything, you can never know anything for sure.
LEONARD: There are things you know for sure.
NATALIE: Such as?
LEONARD: I know the feel of the world. I know how this wood will sound when I I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up. Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much. I know the feel of the world, and I know her.
NATALIE: Your wife?
LEONARD: She's gone and the present is trivia, which I can scribble down as notes. Natalie stares at Leonard, thinking.
NATALIE: Relax a little, okay? Take off your Leonard takes his jacket off and places it on the back of the couch, patting the pockets as he does so.
LEONARD: It's not easy to be calm when -
NATALIE: Just relax. She reaches for his arm and unbuttons his cuff, revealing the end of Leonard's tattoos. You don't seem the type. She pushes back the sleeve, trying to read the tattoo. Leonard watches her. Come on. She starts to unbutton his shirt. He watches. Natalie gasps as she opens Leonard's shirt and pulls it back over his shoulders. She tilts her head, trying to read the different It's backwards. She pulls him up and turns him around in front of the mirror to read the backwards tattoo across his chest.
LEONARD: It's. it must be for when I've found him.
LEONARD: I'm sorry.
NATALIE: His name was Jimmy.
LEONARD: What happened?
NATALIE: He went to meet somebody and didn't come Who did he go to meet? Natalie studies Leonard.
LEONARD: Who did he go to meet? Natalie studies Leonard.
NATALIE: A guy called Teddy. Leonard does not react to the name.
LEONARD: What do the police think?
NATALIE: They don't look too hard for guys like Natalie puts the photo down. She reaches out to Leonard, spreading her fingers over the blank part of his chest. When you find this guy, this John G., what are you going to do?
LEONARD: Kill him.
NATALIE: Maybe I can help you find him. I know a lot of people.
LEONARD: I don't even know how long she's been gone. It's like I've woken up in bed and she's not here because she's gone to the bathroom or something. But somehow I just know that she'll never come back to bed. I lie here, not knowing how long I've been alone. If I could just reach out and touch her side of the bed I could know that it was cold, but I can't. I have no idea when she left. Natalie's eyes are open. I know I can't have her back, but I want to be able to let her go. I don't want to wake up every morning thinking she's still here then realizing that she's not. I want time to pass, but it won't. How can I heal if I can't feel time? Leonard bends his head around to see if Natalie is awake. She closes her eyes. Leonard gingerly slides from underneath her and moves silently out of the bedroom.
LEONARD: Sammy's wife was crippled by the cost of supporting him and fighting the company's decision - but it wasn't the money that got to her.
SEQUENCE##: Mrs. Jankis comes into the room. Sammy is seated, watching T.V. He looks up at her with a smile. She smiles back, tense.
TEDDY: Finished playing with yourself, Lenny?
LEONARD: Why are you here?
TEDDY: ( surprised ) You called me. You wanted my help. You know, Lenny, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep using the same jokes. Leonard thinks, then moves to the CLOSET and OPENS the door. Teddy looks in DISBELIEF at the Man in the closet. TEDDY ( cont'd ) Who the fuck is that?
LEONARD: You don't know him?
TEDDY: No! Should I? Leonard shrugs. Is this John G.?
LEONARD: I don't think so.
TEDDY: Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
LEONARD: I might have fallen asleep before I did. Teddy shakes his head, chuckling.
TEDDY: Ask him. Leonard crouches down and RIPS the tape from the Man's mouth.
LEONARD: What's your name?
MAN: Who did this to you?
LEONARD: Who did this to you?
DODD: ( confused ) Who did this to you?
LEONARD: Who did this to you?
DODD: You did. Leonard replaces the gag and SHUTS the closet.
TEDDY: I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what -
LEONARD: No. No, just let me think for a minute. Leonard moves to the dresser and starts methodically emptying his pockets. He pulls a Polaroid out of his inside jacket Here we go. The Polaroid shows Dodd sitting on the bed, BOUND, GAGGED and BLEEDING. The name Dodd is written below the picture. Leonard flips it over. On the back it says:
TEDDY: Natalie? Natalie who?
LEONARD: ( CONTINUED ) 69 CONTINUED: ( 3 ) 69 I think I know her. Leonard sticks his pictures in his pocket.
TEDDY: I think I know her. Leonard sticks his pictures in his pocket.
LEONARD: We've got to get him out of here.
TEDDY: He's got to have a car, right? We just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill We can't just walk him out tied up and How'd ya get him in here in the first I don't know. Leonard looks around the room for inspiration. Yes I do. this isn't my room. Teddy looks around at the anonymous room. It's his. He was already here. Let's just Leonard starts for the door, Teddy lays a hand on his chest.

TEDDY: Wait, we can't just leave him. The maid finds him, calls the cops. He's seen us now Leonard thinks.
LEONARD: Okay. We clean him up, untie him and march him out with a gun in his back.
TEDDY: Why would I have a gun? Leonard fishes the HANDGUN out of the bedside table drawer.
LEONARD: It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.
TEDDY: Fucking hope not. Leonard covers Dodd with the gun while Teddy pulls him out of the closet. Dodd has trouble standing up straight. MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99
LEONARD: Which one? Dodd leads them to a new LANDCRUISER. Teddy whispers in Leonard's ear.
TEDDY: We probably ought to take his car, you know, teach him a lesson.
LEONARD: Shut it, Teddy.
TEDDY: Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
LEONARD: I'll ride with him. You follow.
TEDDY: Give me your keys. Leonard looks at him, suspicious.
LEONARD: Take your own car. Teddy shrugs. Leonard motions Dodd into the driver's seat, then slides into the passenger side. They pull out of the parking lot, Teddy following in his GREY SEDAN.
TEDDY: So was he scared?
LEONARD: Yeah. I think it was your sinister mustache that got him.
TEDDY: Fuck you. We shoulda taken his car.
LEONARD: What's wrong with this one?
TEDDY: You like it? Let's trade.
TEDDY: So what are you gonna do now?
LEONARD: I'm gonna ask Natalie what the fuck that was all about.
TEDDY: Natalie who? Leonard ignores him and gets into his Jaguar.
LEONARD: Natalie, right? Natalie nods, wary of Leonard's tone. Leonard THRUSTS a Polaroid in her face. Who the fuck is Dodd? The photo shows Dodd, BOUND, GAGGED and BLEEDING.
LEONARD: What Mrs. Jankis didn't understand was that you can't bully someone into remembering. the more pressure you're under, the harder it gets. Then call me back. Leonard hangs up.
LEONARD: Not just now! Leonard listens to the maid withdraw her key. Leonard SEARCHES Dodd, finding his GUN in his inside pocket. Leonard examines the weapon, then starts to search the room. Leonard finds an overnight bag at the bottom of the closet. Inside it there are some clothes, spare ammunition, a large hunting knife, and a roll of SILVER ELECTRICAL TAPE. Leonard WRAPS the electrical tape around Dodd's wrists, then across his mouth. Leonard finishes taping up Dodd, then sits him on the edge of the bed. Leonard takes a POLAROID PHOTOGRAPH of the bloody, taped-up Dodd. Leonard shoves Dodd into the closet, takes out a NOTE and consults it, then writes "DODD" on the white strip on the front of the photograph. He flips the picture over and writes on the strip on the back, in smaller writing:
LEONARD: Ah, it's a message for Teddy. Leonard looks at the note. I'm at the MOUNTCREST INN on 5th Street, Room 6, and I need you to come over as soon as you get this, it's important. This is Leonard. Thanks. Bye. Leonard hangs up. He looks around the room. He slips the HANDGUN into the bedside drawer, resting it on the GIDEON BIBLE, then swings his feet up onto the bed and lies down.
DODD: I haven't made a strong enough Don't be too hard on yourself. Dodd motions for Leonard to open the passenger side door. Dodd gets into the passenger seat, gun on Leonard. Leonard nods to him.
LEONARD: ( amused ) Don't be too hard on yourself. Dodd motions for Leonard to open the passenger side door. Dodd gets into the passenger seat, gun on Leonard. Leonard nods to him.
LEONARD: Seat belt. Leonard starts to reach over his left shoulder with his right hand as if for the seat belt. Dodd watches Leonard's right With his left hand, Leonard opens the door. He rolls out, SLAMMING the door in Dodd's face, and hitting the central locking on his car keys. Leonard TAKES OFF across the asphalt. Dodd tries the doors, then SHOOTS at Leonard, SHATTERING the driver's side window, triggering the CAR ALARM. Dodd climbs through the window and takes off after him. Leonard slips into a trailer park, TRIPPING as he DIVES into a gap between two trailers, STUMBLING over the PLASTIC LAWN FURNITURE and OLD BIKES which litter the narrow gap. He picks himself up and SPRINTS into the alley behind the trailers. He races along behind the trailers. Leonard is RUNNING FURIOUSLY, arms pumping. What the fuck am I doing?
LEONARD: How can you read that again?
LEONARD'S WIFE: ( without looking up ) It's good.
LEONARD: You've read it a hundred times.
LEONARD'S WIFE: I enjoy it.
LEONARD: Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next -
LEONARD'S WIFE: ( looks up, annoyed ) Don't be a prick. I'm not reading it to annoy you, I enjoy it. Just let me read, 95 EXT. RESERVOIR - NIGHT > 95 He places the BOOK on the fire. He reaches into the bag, produces a BRA and a HAIRBRUSH. He puts the bra on the fire, then pulls some BLACK HAIR out of the hairbrush. He holds a few strands out above the fire until they shrivel up in the heat. He does this with a larger clump and it produces a SMALL FLAME so he DROPS it into the fire.
DODD: I like your car.
LEONARD: Where'd you get it?
DODD: Where'd you get it?
LEONARD: Interested in buying one?
DODD: I just want you to tell me how you came by that car.
LEONARD: I forget. Dodd points his gun at Leonard through the window.
DODD: I haven't made a strong enough impression on you.
LEONARD: ( amused ) I wouldn't be too hard on yourself.
LEONARD: Who is this?
LEONARD: ( about to tell her something ) The sound of the SHOWER being run. Leonard opens his eyes and looks over to the bathroom door. LEONARD ( cont'd ) ( relaxed ) Honey? It's late. Leonard swings his legs over and sits on the edge of the bed. Move in on Leonard's face.
BLONDE: Was it good for you? Leonard stands in the doorway, SHAKEN. The Blonde realizes that Leonard is not happy.
LEONARD: No. That would have been worse. Leonard moves to turn off the shower. I'd like you to leave now.
LEONARD: Well, sir, that would certainly be in keeping with some of my own discoveries. Yeah, I was hoping to get more on the drugs angle. Hang on a second. Leonard drops the needle/pen, pulls a LARGE FILE out of his sports bag and opens it on the bed. The police report mentioned the drugs found in the car outside my house. The car was stolen, but his prints were all over it, along with some of his stuff. And I think there's something. Something about a syringe. I've got a copy of the police report.
LEONARD: None? Okay, blonde. Yeah, blonde is fine. Discount Inn, 304. Leonard.
BLONDE: Well, what then?
LEONARD: It's simple, you just go to the bathroom. The Blonde turns, surprised. Leonard smiles, embarrassed. No, you just go into the bathroom. We go to bed, you wait till I fall asleep, then you go into the bathroom and slam the door.
BLONDE: Slam it?
LEONARD: Just loud enough to wake me up.
BLONDE: That's it?
LEONARD: That's it. Leonard gets up, pulls a paper shopping bag out of the closet and hands it to the Blonde. But, first I need you to put these things The Blonde looks confused. Just pretend these things are yours, and this is your bedroom. The Blonde pulls a bra out of the bag.
BLONDE: Should I wear it?
LEONARD: No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.
BLONDE: Whatever gets you off. The Blonde pulls the hairbrush out of the bag. She moves to brush her hair with it, but Leonard stops her.
LEONARD: No! No, don't use it, you, I mean it's. you just have to put it where you would if it were yours. The Blonde sees the BLACK HAIR stuck in the brush.
"FACT 5.": The drugs stashed in the car doesn't ring true for me. Leonard consults his FILE CARD, which says:
LEONARD: The drugs stashed in the car doesn't ring true for me. Leonard consults his FILE CARD, which says:
LEONARD: Who the fuck are you?
TEDDY: ( gasping ) Teddy. Your buddy.
LEONARD: Prove it.
TEDDY: ( gasping ) Sammy. Remember Sammy. You told me about Leonard lets him go.
LEONARD: What are you doing in my car? Teddy is now wearing his big grin, rubbing his neck.
TEDDY: Sense of humour went with the memory, huh? You know why you're still here, don't you?
LEONARD: Unfinished business.
TEDDY: Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.
LEONARD: Who's she? Teddy chuckles.
TEDDY: Whose house do you think you just walked out of? Leonard looks at the house. Teddy motions towards Leonard's Take a look at your pictures, I bet you got one of her. Leonard pulls out his Polaroids and flips through them. He pauses at the one of Natalie. Teddy SWIPES it out of his hands to get a better look at the blurred image of Natalie turning in a doorway. Great shot, Lenny. Teddy flips the photo over. There is nothing on the back. Teddy hands it back to Leonard. You wanna make a note that you can't trust her.
LEONARD: Why's that?
TEDDY: Because she'll have taken one look at your clothes and your car and started thinking of ways to turn the situation to her advantage. She's already got you staying with her, for fuck's sake.
LEONARD: What do you mean "bad news"?
TEDDY: She's involved with these drug dealers. Teddy opens the GLOVE COMPARTMENT, finding a STACK OF BEER MATS from a local bar called FERDY'S. See these? That's the bar where she works. Her boyfriend's a drug dealer. She'd take orders for him, arrange meets. He'd write messages on these, then leave it on the bar. She'd drop replies when she served him drinks.
LEONARD: Why should I care? Teddy starts writing on the BEER MAT.
TEDDY: She's gonna use you. To protect herself.
LEONARD: From who?
TEDDY: Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.
LEONARD: Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?
TEDDY: She couldn't.
LEONARD: Why not?
TEDDY: ( grins ) She has no idea who I am.
LEONARD: Why are you following me?
TEDDY: I'm trying to help you. I knew she'd get her claws into you. She doesn't know anything about your investigation, so when she offers to help you, it'll be for her own reasons. Why would I lie? Do not go back to her. Take out a pen, write yourself a note, do not trust her. Leonard takes out his pen, places the picture of Natalie face down on the dash and writes on the white strip on the back:
LEONARD: Happy now?
TEDDY: I won't be happy until you leave town.
LEONARD: How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking What sort of questions?
TEDDY: How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking What sort of questions?
LEONARD: What sort of questions?
TEDDY: The sort of questions you should be asking yourself.
LEONARD: Like what?
TEDDY: Like how'd you get this car? That suit?
LEONARD: I have money.
TEDDY: From what?
LEONARD: My wife's death. I used to work in Insurance, we were well covered.
TEDDY: So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership? Leonard says nothing. Teddy laughs. You haven't got a clue, have you? You don't even know who you are?
LEONARD: Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran -
TEDDY: That's who you were, Lenny. You don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around, playing detective. and you don't even know how long ago it was. Teddy reaches out to Leonard's lapel, and gently opens his jacket to reveal the label. Put it this way. Were you wearing designer suits when you sold insurance? Leonard looks down at his suit, then back to Teddy.
LEONARD: I didn't sell -
TEDDY: I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself.
LEONARD: Yeah, well, thanks for the advice.
TEDDY: Don't go back in there. There's a motel out of town.
LEONARD: Fuck it. I need my own place. Leonard starts the engine.
LEONARD: I can't blame the cops for not taking me seriously. This is a difficult condition for people to understand. I mean look at Sammy Jankis. His own wife couldn't deal with it.
MRS. JANKIS: Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy and you decided that he was faking -
LEONARD: Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is "faking" anything, just that his condition can't be shown -
MRS. JANKIS: I'm not interested in the company position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know your honest opinion about Sammy.
LEONARD: We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal.
MRS. JANKIS: I'm not appealing the decision.
LEONARD: Then why are you here?
MRS. JANKIS: Mr. Shelby, try and understand. When I look into Sammy's eyes, I don't see some vegetable, I see the same old Sammy. What do you think it's like for me to suspect that he's imagining this whole problem? That if I could just say the right thing he'd snap out of it and be back to normal? If I knew that my old Sammy was truly gone, then I could say goodbye and start loving this new Sammy. As long as I have doubt, I can't say goodbye and move on.
LEONARD: Mrs. Jankis, what do you want from me?
MRS. JANKIS: I want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds, and tell me if you really think that Sammy is faking his condition. Leonard plays with his letter opener, thinking. I need to know what you honestly I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new Thank you.
LEONARD: ( looks at Mrs. Jankis ) I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new MRS. JANKIS Thank you.
MRS. JANKIS: Thank you.
LEONARD: She seemed to leave happy. I thought I'd helped her. Leonard puts the NEEDLE/PEN down, and wipes blood from his new, homemade TATTOO, which says:
LEONARD: What happened? Natalie, intensely AGITATED, FUMBLES with things in her purse.
NATALIE: What does it look like?! She turns to Leonard so that he can see the full extent of her injuries. Her eye is SWELLING UP, and her lip is SPLIT. He beat the shit out of me.
LEONARD: Who?! Fuck, Leonard! Dodd! Dodd beat the shit out of me. Natalie FLINGS her purse to the ground in frustration. She does not know what to do with her hands.
NATALIE: Who?! Fuck, Leonard! Dodd! Dodd beat the shit out of me. Natalie FLINGS her purse to the ground in frustration. She does not know what to do with her hands.
LEONARD: Natalie turns to him, ENRAGED.
NATALIE: Because of you, you fucking idiot! Because I did what you told me!
LEONARD: Calm down. Natalie starts to HIT Leonard. He takes her arms. Take it easy. You're safe now. You're He sits her down on the couch. Let's get some ice on your face.
NATALIE: I did exactly what you told me. I went to Dodd and I said that I didn't have Jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this Teddy must have taken everything.
LEONARD: And what did he say?
NATALIE: He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting Where is he?
LEONARD: Where is he?
NATALIE: What are you gonna do?
LEONARD: I'll go see him.

NATALIE: He'll kill you, Lenny.
LEONARD: ( smiling ) My wife used to call me Lenny.
NATALIE: Yeah, I hated it.
LEONARD: Yeah, I hated it.
NATALIE: This guy's dangerous, let's think of something else. Leonard takes out a piece of paper but he cannot find his I'll take care of it. Just tell me what he looks like, and where I can find him. Do you have a pen? Natalie gets a pen out of her purse and hands it to him.
LEONARD: I'll take care of it. Just tell me what he looks like, and where I can find him. Do you have a pen? Natalie gets a pen out of her purse and hands it to him.
NATALIE: He'll probably find you.
LEONARD: Me? Why would he be interested in me?
NATALIE: I told him about your car.
LEONARD: Why would you do that?
NATALIE: He was beating the crap out of me! I had to tell him something! Leonard hands Natalie the piece of paper and pen.
LEONARD: Just write it all down. What he looks like, where I find him.
LEONARD: No, she shouldn't have given me that responsibility. Shit, I'm not a doctor, I'm a claims investigator. Leonard crooks his neck to hold the receiver between ear and shoulder and FIDDLES with the BANDAGE ON HIS LEFT ARM, starting to peel back the tape, t.zying to look under the cotton pad. I suppose, but I've got all sorts of other considerations. Leonard starts to REMOVE THE BANDAGE. Legal responsibility, and large LEONARD REMOVES THE BANDAGE FROM HIS LEFT ARM, REVEALING A CRUDE TATTOO WHICH SAYS: "NEVER ANSWER THE PHONE" Leonard looks up.
LEONARD: What's wrong?
NATALIE: Somebody's come. Already.
LEONARD: Calls himself Dodd.
NATALIE: Calls himself Dodd.
LEONARD: What does he want?
NATALIE: Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
LEONARD: Did you?
NATALIE: What's this all about? Natalie looks at him bitterly.
LEONARD: What's this all about? Natalie looks at him bitterly.
NATALIE: You don't know, do you? You're blissfully ignorant, aren't you?
LEONARD: I have this condition -
NATALIE: I know about your fucking condition, Leonard! I probably know more about it than you do! You don't have a fucking clue about anything else!
LEONARD: What happened?
NATALIE: What happened is that Jimmy went to meet a guy called Teddy. He took a lot of money with him and he didn't come back. Jimmy's partners think I set him up. I don't know whether you know this Teddy or how well - Leonard is getting frustrated.
LEONARD: Neither do I.
NATALIE: Don't protect him.
LEONARD: I'm not.
NATALIE: Help me.
LEONARD: Get rid of Dodd for me.
NATALIE: Get rid of Dodd for me.
LEONARD: Kill him. I'll pay you.
NATALIE: Kill him. I'll pay you.
LEONARD: What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
NATALIE: What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
LEONARD: That's different.
NATALIE: Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to Don't talk about my wife.
LEONARD: Don't talk about my wife.
NATALIE: I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends! Leonard stands up.
LEONARD: Calm down.
NATALIE: That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
LEONARD: Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.
NATALIE: Maybe it is! How the fuck would you know?! You don't know a fucking thing! You can't get scared, can you get angry?! Leonard steps towards her.
LEONARD: You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
NATALIE: You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
LEONARD: Shut the fuck up! Natalie gets right in his face, grinning.
NATALIE: I'm gonna use you, you stupid fuck. I'm telling you now because I'll enjoy it more if I know that you could stop me if you weren't a freak.
LEONARD: Don't say another fucking word!
NATALIE: About your whore of a wife? Leonard slaps Natalie. She smiles, then speaks softly. I read about your problem. You know what one of the causes of short term memory loss is? Leonard fumes. Venereal disease. Maybe your cunt of a wife sucked one too many diseased cocks and turned you into a retard. Leonard turns away, body tensed, ready to snap. Natalie reaches out to gently brush the hair above his ear with her You sad freak, you won't remember any of what I've said, and we'll be best friends, or even lovers. Leonard spins around, BACKHANDING Natalie on the cheek. He PUNCHES her in the mouth then pushes her to the floor. He stands over her, furious with himself as much as her.
LEONARD: What happened? Natalie, intensely AGITATED, FUMBLES with things in her What does it look like?
NATALIE: What does it look like?
LEONARD: Front desk? Burt, right. Well, this is Mr. Shelby in Room 21. I don't want any calls, none at all, got it? Thanks.
NATALIE: You can just crash out on the couch. You'll be comfortable. Leonard nods and stands awkwardly. Uh, take a seat. Leonard smiles and sits down in a chair. Natalie clears things off the coffee table. Leonard unzips his bag and looks through his things, pulling out his file. So how long you think it's gonna take Leonard raises his eyebrows. You told me you were looking for the guy who killed your wife.
LEONARD: ( consulting file ) Depends on if he's here in town. Or if he's moved on. See, I've got all this -
NATALIE: Can I ask you something? Leonard nods. If you've got all this information, how come the police haven't found him for They're not looking for him.
LEONARD: They're not looking for him.
NATALIE: Why not?
LEONARD: They don't think he exists. Natalie looks confused. I told them what I remembered. I was asleep, something woke me up.
NIGHT >: We move down the hail towards a closed door. Shadows and light play across the floorboards from the gap under the door. An ominous rumbling builds.
NATALIE: How did they explain what you remembered? The gun and stuff?
LEONARD: ( points at conclusions on back of file ) John G. was clever. He took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap that he'd hit me with. He left my gun and left the getaway car. He gave the police a complete package. They found a sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand, and they only found my gun. They didn't need to look for anyone else. I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage. Natalie watches him.
NATALIE: You can stay here for a couple of days if it'll help.
LEONARD: Thank you.
NATALIE: I've got to get back for the evening shift, so make yourself at home, watch T.V., whatever. Just grab a blanket and pillow off the bed. I never need them all Leonard nods. Natalie heads for the door.
LEONARD: Oh, one thing. Natalie TURNS. Leonard snaps her picture with his Polaroid camera. He lowers the camera and smiles. Something to remember you by. Natalie smiles unconvincingly, perturbed, and exits. Leonard sits down on the couch and writes "Natalie" on the white strip under her photo as it develops into the blurred image of Natalie which we have seen before. He takes out his other Polaroids, flipping through them.

LEONARD: A cop?
BURT: And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.
LEONARD: ( shakes head ) I'm not too good on the phone. I need to look people in the eye when I talk to Burt shrugs, then walks off.
NATALIE: On the house.
LEONARD: Natalie watches in fascination as Leonard drinks from the mug. The Drunk is giggling.
NATALIE: ( fascinated ) You really do have a problem. Just like that cop said. Leonard looks at Natalie, confused.
LEONARD: ( shrugs ) Nobody's perfect. Natalie leans in close, studying Leonard, looking him over.

LEONARD: A BEER, please.

NATALIE: What are you here for?
LEONARD: I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
NATALIE: Well, that's me.
LEONARD: Oh. But haven't we met before? Natalie slowly shakes her head. Leonard is confused. So why am I here?
NATALIE: You tell me.
LEONARD: I don't remember. See, I have no short- term memory. It's not amnesia -
NATALIE: You're the memory guy?
LEONARD: How do you know about me?
NATALIE: My boyfriend told me about you.
LEONARD: Who's your boyfriend?
NATALIE: ( beat ) Jimmy Grantz. Know him? Leonard shrugs. NATALIE ( cont'd ) Well, it seems like Jimmy knows you. He told me about you. Said you were staying over at the Discount. Then, just this evening, this cop comes in here looking for you. Looking for a guy who couldn't remember stuff, who'd forget how he got here or where he was going. I told him we get a lot of guys like that in here. Leonard does not find this funny.
LEONARD: Chronic alcoholism ~ one cause of short term memory loss.

LEONARD: My name's Leonard.

LEONARD: No, Officer, but with my condition, you don't know anything. you feel angry, guilty, you don't know why. You could do something terrible and not have the faintest idea ten minutes later.

LEONARD: I'd like this on my thigh please. Leonard hands her a FILE CARD. She reads the card, then looks at him. He shrugs.
LEONARD: Promise you won't call me an idiot. He pulls down his trousers, revealing his SCABBY, homemade tattoo. ( "FACT 5: DRUG DEALER" ). The tattooist looks at it.

TEDDY: Hi, Lenny. The tattooist turns and looks up at Teddy.
TATTOOIST: It's private back here.
TEDDY: It's alright, we know each other, right, The tattooist looks to Leaonard. Leonard shrugs.
LEONARD: How'd you know I was in here?
TEDDY: The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even Bother to put it around back. Teddy cranes his neck to see what the tattoo says, but only "6. LI" is visible. You should have just left town, Lenny. There's Tattoo parlors up North.
LEONARD: Guess I wanted to get something down before it slipped my mind. The tattoo needle buzzes as the tattooist makes a start on the next letter: a "C". Teddy sticks his hand through the Gimme the keys, I'll move the car. Leonard watches Teddy.
TEDDY: Gimme the keys, I'll move the car. Leonard watches Teddy.
LEONARD: It'll be alright for a minute. Teddy shrugs. The tattooist looks up at him.
TATTOOIST: Wait out there. Teddy goes back through the curtain. Teddy pops his head back through the curtain.
TEDDY: Lenny, I'll be back in a minute. I've got to get you some stuff.
TEDDY: Give us a minute, will ya? She shrugs and heads into the back. Teddy watches her go, then turns to Leonard, conspiratorial. We've got to get you out of here.
LEONARD: Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
TEDDY: Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
LEONARD: Why not?
TEDDY: Because that cop's looking for you. We need to get you a change of identity. Some new clothes and a different car should do for now. Put these on. Teddy offers the bag of clothes. Leonard refuses it.
LEONARD: What cop?
TEDDY: This bad cop. He checked you into the Discount Inn. Then he's been calling you for days, sticking envelopes under your door, telling you shit.
LEONARD: He knows you're no good on the phone, so he calls you up to bullshit you. Sometimes you stop taking his calls, so he slips something under your door to frighten you into answering your phone again. He's been pretending to help you. Feeding you a line of crap about John G. being some local drug dealer.

LEONARD: What did he want to know from you?
TEDDY: He wanted to know all, about Jimmy Grantz.
LEONARD: Jimmy's a drug dealer. This cop wanted to know all about how he sets up deals, shit like that. He's got some score in mind and you're involved.

LEONARD: ( under his breath ) Sneaky fuck. "Bad Cop". Had me going. Leonard puts his jacket back on, checks the other pockets. He finds a BEER MAT for a local bar named FERDY'S. There is a message written on it:
LEONARD: So this Jimmy Grantz deals drugs out of the bar where his girlfriend works. But he'll come to the meet alone. Leonard looks down at the FRESH TATTOO on his thigh.
TEDDY: Leonard smiles cautiously, and offers his hand.
LEONARD: Officer Gammell.
LEONARD: Something to remember you by. Leonard lowers the camera and takes out a pen, resting the picture against the truck, about to write on the white strip beneath the developing picture. I'm sorry - is it Officer, or Lieutenant Teddy coughs and looks at the picture.
TEDDY: Just Teddy. Don't write Gammell please. Leonard raises his eyebrows. I'm undercover. Here's directions. He'll be heading there now.
LEONARD: You're not coming?
TEDDY: Wouldn't be appropriate. Leonard climbs into the truck. Teddy taps on the window. Leonard cranks it down. Teddy looks at Leonard with something like fatherly affection. Make him beg.

JIMMY: What?! What do you want from me?! Leonard looks up.
LEONARD: I want my fucking life back! Jimmy SWINGS at Leonard with a BROKEN FLOORBOARD, STRIKING his shoulder. The jack handle goes flying. Jimmy SWINGS again, misses. Leonard GRABS him, taking him down. The two of them STRUGGLE on the floor. Leonard gets ON TOP of Jimmy, CHOKING him. Jimmy tries to speak, but can only make GURGLING noises.

LEONARD: ( panicked ) He might have fallen down the stairs, I don't know, I don't know what's going on, I'm confused. I have this memory thing - do I know you?
TEDDY: No. Don't worry, I'm a cop. Everything'll be okay. Is he still breathing?
LEONARD: Maybe. Maybe just. They go down into the basement.

LEONARD: What was it for?
TEDDY: A load of amphetamine I told him I had.
LEONARD: This is a drug deal?!
TEDDY: That, and your thing.
LEONARD: But how did he know me?
TEDDY: The Discount Inn, he deals out of there. The guy at the front desk lets him know if anybody comes snooping around. He called Jimmy as soon as you took a picture of that dump.
LEONARD: You're using me! Teddy looks at him, offended.
TEDDY: ( beat ) You get half. Leonard THROWS him against the wall.
LEONARD: He knew about Sammy. Why would I tell him about Sammy?
TEDDY: ( chuckles ) You tell everyone about Sammy. Everyone who'll listen. "Remember Sammy Jankis, remember Sammy Jankis". Great story. Gets better every time you tell it. So you lie to yourself to be happy. Nothing wrong with that - we all do. Who cares if there's a few little things you'd rather not remember?
LEONARD: What the fuck are you talking about?
TEDDY: ( theatrical shrug ) I dunno. your wife surviving the assault. her not believing about your condition. the doubt tearing her up inside.., the insulin -
LEONARD: That's Sammy, not me! I told you about Sammy -
TEDDY: Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
LEONARD: Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - !
TEDDY: Sammy was a con man. A faker.
LEONARD: I never said he was faking! I never said You exposed him for what he was: a fraud.

LEONARD: I was wrong! That's the whole point! Sammy's wife came to me and -
TEDDY: Sammy didn't have a wife. Leonard freezes, staring at Teddy. It was your wife who had diabetes. Leonard thinks.
LEONARD'S WIFE: Leonard has a syringe in his hand.
LEONARD: My wife wasn't diabetic.
TEDDY: Are you sure?
LEONARD'S WIFE: ( CONTINUED ) MEMENTO - Green Revisions 10-4-99
LEONARD: She wasn't diabetic. You think I don't know my own wife? What the fuck is wrong with you?
TEDDY: ( shrugs ) I guess I can only make you believe the things you want to be true, huh? Like ol' Jimmy down there.
LEONARD: But he's not the right guy!
TEDDY: He was to you. Come on, Lenny, you got your revenge - just enjoy it while you still remember.
TEDDY: ( chuckles ) What difference does it make whether he was your guy or not?
LEONARD: It makes all the difference.
TEDDY: Why? You're never going to know.
LEONARD: Yes, I will.
TEDDY: No, you won't.
LEONARD: Somehow, I'll know!
TEDDY: You won't remember!
LEONARD: When it's done, I'll know! It'll be I thought so too! I was sure you'd remember. But you didn't. Beat. Leonard looks at Teddy, questioning.
TEDDY: I thought so too! I was sure you'd remember. But you didn't. Beat. Leonard looks at Teddy, questioning.
TEDDY: ( off look ) You know, when we found your guy and killed him. ( off look ) That's right, the real John G. Over a year ago. I helped you find him. He's already dead.
LEONARD: Why do you keep lying to me?
TEDDY: I'm not. I was the cop assigned to your wife's death. I believed you, I thought you deserved the chance for revenge. I helped you find the other guy who was in your bathroom that night. The guy who cracked your skull and fucked your wife. We found him and you killed him.
LEONARD: So who are you saying he was?
TEDDY: Just some guy. Does it even matter who? I stopped asking myself why a long time ago. No reason, no conspiracy; just bad fucking luck. A couple of junkies, too strung out to realize that your wife didn't live alone. When you killed him, I've never seen you so happy - I was convinced you'd remember. But it didn't stick, like nothing ever sticks. Like this won't stick. Leonard looks at the Polaroid of himself. That's the picture, right? I took that, right when you did it. Look how happy you are. Before you forgot. I wanted to see that face again.
LEONARD: ( sarcastic ) Thank you.
TEDDY: Fuck you; I gave you a reason to live and you were more than happy to help. You lie to yourself! You don't want the truth, the truth is a fucking coward. So you make up your own truth.
LEONARD: You probably.
TEDDY: No. You took them out.
LEONARD: Why would I do that?
TEDDY: To set yourself a puzzle you won't ever solve. You know how many towns, how many guys called James G? Or John G? Shit, Leonard, I'm a John G.
LEONARD: Your name's Teddy.
TEDDY: ( chuckles ) My mother calls me Teddy. I'm John Edward Gammell. Cheer up, there's a lot of John G's for us to find. All you do is moan. I'm the one that has to live with what you've done. I'm the one that has to put it all together. You just wander around playing detective. You're living a dream, kid. A dead wife to pine for and a sense of purpose to your life. A romantic quest which you wouldn't end even if I wasn't in the picture. Leonard sticks the gun in Teddy's face.
LEONARD: I should kill you.
TEDDY: Quit it! You're not a killer, Lenny. That's why you're so good at it. Leonard SEARCHES Teddy's pockets, still holding the gun on Teddy. Leonard finds Teddy's CAR KEYS. He gets off Teddy and moves towards the light.
TEDDY: Hey! Hey, that's not your car! Leonard SNAPS a Polaroid of the Jaguar.
LEONARD: It is now.
TEDDY: You can't just take it! Leonard UNLOCKS the trunk, TURNING to Teddy as he does so.
LEONARD: Why not?
TEDDY: You just killed the guy who owned it! Somebody'll recognize it! Leonard pulls Teddy's EMPTY gun out of his pocket.
LEONARD: I'd rather be mistaken for a dead guy than a murderer. I'm gonna hang on to Leonard TOSSES the GUN into the trunk. It lands on PILES OF BANKNOTES STUFFED IN THE TRUNK. Teddy REACTS to the sight of the money. Leonard glances at Teddy, then the money, shakes his head, then SLAMS the trunk. Teddy jogs back to where he was looking for his keys.
ROLL CREDITS: The following is Jonathan Nolan's short story "Memento Mori", the inspiration for his brother, Christopher Nolan's, screenplay for the film, MEMENTO:
MEMENTO MORI: Jonathan Nolan What like a bullet can undeceive!" Your wife always used to say you'd be late for your own funeral. Remember that? Her little joke because you were such a slob-always late, always forgetting stuff, even before the incident. Right about now you're probably wondering if you were late for hers. You were there, you can be sure of that. That's what the picture's for-the one tacked to the wall by the door. It's not customary to take pictures at a funeral, but somebody, your doctors, I guess, knew you wouldn't remember. They had it blown up nice and big and stuck it right there, next to the door, so you couldn't help but see it every time you got up to find out where she was. The guy in the picture, the one with the flowers? That's you. And what are you doing? You're reading the headstone, trying to figure out who's funeral you're at, same as you're reading it now, trying to figure why someone stuck that picture next to your door. But why bother reading something that you won't remember? She's gone, gone for good, and you must be hurting right now, hearing the news. Believe me, I know how you feel. You're probably a wreck. But give it five minutes, maybe ten. Maybe you can even go a whole half hour before you forget. But you will forget-I guarantee it. A few more minutes and you'll be heading for the door, looking for her all over again, breaking down when you find the picture. How many times do you have to hear the news before some other part of your body, other than that busted brain of yours, starts to remember? Never-ending grief, never-ending anger. Useless without direction. Maybe you can't understand what's happened. Can't say I really understand, either. Backwards amnesia. That's what the sign says. CRS disease. Your guess is as good as mine. Maybe you can't understand what happened to you. But you do remember what happened to HER, don't you? The doctors don't want to talk about it. They won't answer my questions. They don't think it's right for a man in your condition to hear about those things. But you remember enough, don't you? You remember his face. This is why I'm writing to you. Futile, maybe. I don't know how many times you'll have to read this before you listen to me. I don't even know how long you've been locked up in this room already. Neither do you. But your advantage in forgetting is that you'll forget to write yourself off as a lost cause. Sooner or later you'll want to do something about it. And when you do, you'll just have to trust me, because I'm the only one who can help EARL OPENS ONE EYE after another to a stretch of white ceiling tiles interrupted by a hand-printed sign taped right above his head, large enough for him to read from the bed. An alarm clock is ringing somewhere. He reads the sign, blinks,reads it again, then takes a look at the room. It's a white room, overwhelmingly white, from the walls and the curtains to the institutional furniture and the bedspread. The alarm clock is ringing from the white desk under the window with the white curtains. At this point Earl probably notices that he is lying on top of his white comforter. He is already wearing a dressing gown and He lies back and reads the sign taped to the ceiling again. It says, in crude block capitals, THIS IS YOUR ROOM. THIS IS A ROOM IN A
