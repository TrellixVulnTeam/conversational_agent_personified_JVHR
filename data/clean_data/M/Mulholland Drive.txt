HERB: Go ahead.
DAN: I had a dream about this place.
HERB: Oh boy.
DAN: You see what I mean.
HERB: Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.
DAN: Well . it's the second one I've had, but they were both the same..they start out that I'm in here but it's not day or night. It's kinda half night, but it looks just like this except for the light, but I'm scared like I can't tell ya. Of all people you're standing right over there by that counter. You're in both dreams and you're scared. I get even more frightened when I see how afraid you are and then I realize what it is - there's a man.in back of this place. He's the one . he's the one that's doing it. I can see him through the wall. I can see his face and I hope I never see that face ever outside a around nervously, then stares at his uneaten food.
HERB: So, you came to see if he's out there?
DAN: To get rid of this god-awful feeling.
HERB: Right then.
DAN: Around here.
HERB: Dan! . Dan! You all right? . Dan!

MRS. LANOIS: In all my living glory, baby.
BETTY: Pleased to meet you.
MRS. LANOIS: You can call me Coco . everybody does. Stay there, I'll get the key.
BETTY: Okay, Coco.
COCO: I guess it was your grandfather, was it . he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man. farmer I hear.
BETTY: Yes, he is. He raises corn.
COCO: Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.
BETTY: Well, I .
COCO: You don't have to tell me. It's written all over that pretty face of yours.. You came here to be an actress. I just hope you'll remember there's never been a great poem called "tits and ass."
BETTY: You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.
COCO: You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.
BETTY: Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you Honey, all the great ones came through here at one time or another.
COCO: Honey, all the great ones came through here at one time or another.
BETTY: I guess I've come to quite a place.
COCO: Sweetheart, you don't know the half of front of her she sees a fresh product of waste from a dog. She angrily turns up to an apartment on the second level.
BETTY: No, I don't.
COCO: That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em.for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard . let's see your Aunt's apartment . it's a good one.
BETTY: I can hardly wait, Coco.
BETTY: It's unbelievable!
COCO: I told ya.
BETTY: Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler. Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.

BETTY: Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
COCO: You got it! See you later honey.
BETTY: Oh my!
BETTY: I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming.
BETTY: I understand. I saw the dress. I.I'm sorry. Are you all right?
BETTY: Are you okay?
BETTY: Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.
BETTY: Hi.do you work with my Aunt?
RITA: No ....I.
BETTY: I.I mean..I.it's none of my She has pretty red hair. she is very kind I think.
RITA: She has pretty red hair. she is very kind I think.
BETTY: She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada, but I guess you know that. I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel.
RITA: I think I've been hurt.
BETTY: BETTY ( cont'd ) Sit down.
RITA: But, this could be serious.
BETTY: But, this could be serious.
RITA: No.I need to sleep.
BETTY: If you have a concussion you shouldn't It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep.
RITA: It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep.
BETTY: All right, but.I'm going to check on and listens to her breathing. She gets a blanket and drapes it over the beautiful sleeping Rita, then leaves the room.
JOE: So man, that's unheard of . an accident like that . who coulda foreseen that.
ED: Unreal . so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?
JOE: Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy.
ED: Making ends meet, huh.
JOE: Yeah, look at my digs . times are tough.
ED: Yeah, look at my digs . times are tough.
JOE: Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble.
ED: It was just a thing. The story made you Yeah, that's a funny story.
JOE: Yeah, that's a funny story.
ED: Yeah, the history of the world in phone holding a silenced pistol and in one swift move reaches out and fires a hole through Ed's temple - blowing Ed's brains out across the desk, carpet and wall. Ed's head bangs down on the desk, then is still save the leaking of blood from the wounds. Joe flips his finished cigarette out the open window behind Ed's desk, wipes the gun clean with a handkerchief and places the cleaned gun in Ed's right hand. He places Ed's right forefinger gently onto the trigger. As he puts the finger on the trigger he presses a little too hard and the gun goes off. The bullet shoots out and penetrates the cheap wall at the far end of Ed's office. Joe hears a muffled slowly and begrudgingly out of Ed's office, checks the corridor and goes toward the screaming which still persists. He opens up the office door next to Ed's and finds a heavy set woman screaming bloody murder as she is grabbing her buttock and lower back. He sighs and walks over to her and cups his hand tightly around her mouth to squelch the screaming. Wide-eyed, she tries to fight him off and he begins dragging her out of her office. Joe's foot catches on a computer cable clumsily taped across the floor and he falls backwards bringing the heavy woman down with a bone-crushing blow on top of him. The woman begins beating his face with her meaty fists. Joe snaps her head back, instantly stilling her violent activity. He wrestles the stunned heavyweight back to her feet and out her door. He pushes and pulls her into Ed's office. Just before they enter, Joe notices a man with a vacuum cleaner watching him from the far end of the corridor. He stops and calls to the man.
VOICES: What the hell .. what happened? What's this cord doing here? It's the vacuum. It's the vacuum what did it.
