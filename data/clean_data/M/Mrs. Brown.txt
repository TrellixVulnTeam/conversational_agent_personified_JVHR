BROWN: God save the Queen!! And fires. Nothing happens. The trees go on swaying, the storm goes on screaming and BROWN just stands there, staring into empty space. A pause. Slowly, he starts to frown as the fact begins to dawn on him that he is alone. He stares at the thrashing trees, waving their mocking arms at him. His hand lets the pistol drop to his side. He feels the rain drench down his face. And now, for the first time, we see that his socks have fallen to his ankles and his knees are cut to shreds. He shifts a foot. His dress-shoes are covered in mud. He goes on staring into the dark. Nothing. Just the wind and rain. Gradually, we pull back, higher and higher. As we do, we hear the quiet cultivated voice:
ASSISTANT DRESSER: ( terrified ) Sorry, ma'am.
JENNER: Congratulations, Your Royal Highness!
BERTIE: Thank you, Doctor.
JENNER: A boy, I hear. Excellent, excellent.
BERTIE: ( beat ) Albert Victor. Eddie for short. What do you think?
PONSONBY: A fine choice, sir.
JENNER: EXT. DOCKSIDE, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY JOHN BROWN leads his pony gently up the ramp and into the carrier bearing the Royal coat of arms. The DRIVER leans BROWN looks straight at this man, quiet and reserved.
DRIVER: Are you riding up front? BROWN looks straight at this man, quiet and reserved.
BROWN: I'll stay with the pony, thank you. She's all the way from Deeside and she's not sure she likes you yet. The DRIVER shrugs and slams the doors on them.
VICTORIA: How many? LADY ELY is slightly taken aback.
LADY ELY: The Royal Family and senior members of the household, ma'am.
VICTORIA: Just them?
LADY ELY: Yes, ma'am. VICTORIA closes her eyes, then steels herself and steps through the door.
JENNER: We're expecting Brown this afternoon, A beat. VICTORIA takes a sip of water, dabs her mouth with her napkin and rises. Everyone else rises too. Suddenly, the Queen turns to Bertie's nervous wife, PRINCESS ALEXANDRA, and proclaims abruptly:
VICTORIA: A beat. VICTORIA takes a sip of water, dabs her mouth with her napkin and rises. Everyone else rises too. Suddenly, the Queen turns to Bertie's nervous wife, PRINCESS ALEXANDRA, and proclaims abruptly:
PRINCESS ALEXANDRA: Yes, ma'am. VICTORIA nods earnestly. Lost to the effect her words have had, she marches out again. Behind her, she leaves PRINCESS ALEXANDRA feeling humiliated and crestfallen in front of all the others. BERTIE takes her hand and squeezes tight, trying awkwardly to console.
BROWN: I was due at a quarter past one. You're late.
PONSONBY: ( in low tones ) Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House is not as you will remember it. The Household remains in full mourning and no-one is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever. As for the Queen's routine, she breakfasts at nine thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five. No one is allowed to leave the building while the Queen is at home. On the rare occasions when she is out, you may ask permission to leave, but only with my consent. You're to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten o'clock. You'll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires.
BROWN: How will I know?
PONSONBY: ( surprised to be interrupted ) I'm sorry?
BROWN: How will I know what she requires?
PONSONBY: You'll be sent a message.
BROWN: Who'll bring it to me?
PONSONBY: Her Highness' Equerry.
BROWN: I need a man who knows where I am.
PONSONBY: I'm sure it won't be difficult to find That's not good enough. A beat.
BROWN: That's not good enough. A beat.
PONSONBY: Then we'll have to see what can be Aye, do. PONSONBY stiffens. A beat.
BROWN: Aye, do. PONSONBY stiffens. A beat.
PONSONBY: There is to be no communication with other members of the household on matters concerning the court except through myself or one of the Equerries. No plans must be altered unless you are given prior authority by myself or a senior member of the I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her.
BROWN: I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her.
PONSONBY: In matters concerning the Household, I act on her behalf. BROWN takes the measure of him.
BROWN: Do you?
PONSONBY: ( beat ) I do. BROWN glances up the corridor.
BROWN: So, is passing wind out of the question or do I need permission for PONSONBY refuses to acknowledge what he has heard. They reach the door of the Royal Chamber and he concludes the As I am sure you remember from Balmoral, you do not talk while in Her Majesty's presence unless Her Majesty addresses you directly. BROWN refuses to answer, so PONSONBY knocks. After a moment, the door is opened by LADY ELY who ushers them in.
PONSONBY: As I am sure you remember from Balmoral, you do not talk while in Her Majesty's presence unless Her Majesty addresses you directly. BROWN refuses to answer, so PONSONBY knocks. After a moment, the door is opened by LADY ELY who ushers them in.
VICTORIA: Mr Brown.
BROWN: You are here safely.
VICTORIA: You are here safely.
BROWN: Aye, ma'am.
VICTORIA: You are well?
BROWN: I am.
VICTORIA: And the pony?
BROWN: She's well, too. VICTORIA blinks at the sight of him. His presence is bringing him back. A beat.
VICTORIA: Your family sent cards. It was much I'm glad of it. In an effort to control her emotions, VICTORIA now sounds the same severe note as at lunch. But BROWN, unlike others, seems unaffected.
BROWN: I'm glad of it. In an effort to control her emotions, VICTORIA now sounds the same severe note as at lunch. But BROWN, unlike others, seems unaffected.
VICTORIA: My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you. He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way. I trust it does not inconvenience you too much.
BROWN: I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
VICTORIA: ( beat ) You have a brother in service here, do you not? ( furrowing her brow ) I forget his name.
BROWN: ( beat ) That will be company for you.
VICTORIA: ( beat ) That will be company for you.
BROWN: Yes, ma'am. Silence. VICTORIA starts to tire. She takes a sip of water and spills a little on herself. Flustered, she searches for a hanky but cannot find one. LADY ELY hurries up with one of her own and the Queen dabs it off. BROWN watches all of this with genuine concern. When VICTORIA finally looks up, he stares at her in deep sympathy.
VICTORIA: You do not - he . get him out. Get him out. Get him out! Suddenly, BROWN finds himself tugged backwards out of the room. LADY ELY rushes up to assist as VICTORIA shouts herself into a fit of uncontrolled sobbing.
ARCHIE: ( telling it fast ) So the day they arrive, she greets the Sultan and his family with barely a word and then retires to her chamber. The Sultan, not used to State Occasions without a head of State, is standing in the lobby waiting for someone to tell him what to do. But the court is under strict instructions not to talk in the corridors so nobody speaks to him, not a living soul, for the whole afternoon. So now it's dinner and everyone's standing round the table still not a word waiting for Her Majesty to arrive. One hour goes by, two, the Sultan's getting a wee bit peckish to say the least. So finally, his wee laddy breaks for the cold meats and stuffs a slice in his mouth. Well, the uproar when she heard. You'd have thought someone had stolen the crown jewels. BROWN stares back, still pissed off.
BROWN: So, there are rules. Things you do and things you don't do.
ARCHIE: So, there are rules. Things you do and things you don't do.
BROWN: I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
ARCHIE: You don't tell Her Majesty how you I speak as I find, Archie.
BROWN: I speak as I find, Archie.
ARCHIE: Not down south you don't. BROWN slams a drawer shut. ARCHIE lets it go and watches his brother. A beat.
BROWN: I think he nearly ruptured his truss. A beat, then both men burst out laughing.
BROWN: How much?
ARCHIE: Seventy a year.
BROWN: Not bad, not bad.
ARCHIE: How about yourself?
BROWN: ( grinning ) That's pretty good for a ghillie. BROWN smiles dryly. They pour themselves a drink from the Prince Leopold? Is he the one who bleeds all day? So what does his valet do? Wash his poultices for him?
ARCHIE: ( grinning ) That's pretty good for a ghillie. BROWN smiles dryly. They pour themselves a drink from the Prince Leopold? Is he the one who bleeds all day? So what does his valet do? Wash his poultices for him?
BROWN: Prince Leopold? Is he the one who bleeds all day? So what does his valet do? Wash his poultices for him?
ARCHIE: It's better than shovelling horse If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
BROWN: If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
ARCHIE: She's hardly a full hamper herself.
BROWN: ( beat ) It's only grief makes her like she is.
ARCHIE: Three years, John. Is that not a bit long to be grieving?
BROWN: She loved him.
ARCHIE: Come on, man. There's love and there's .
BROWN: You know what I mean.
ARCHIE: You know what I mean.
BROWN: I'm not sure I do, Archie.
ARCHIE: There's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to. Hold on BROWN. He lets it go and moves on. Across the hall, he spots the pretty ASSISTANT DRESSER watching them.
BROWN: Which one of us is she flirting with?
ARCHIE: The good-looking one.
BROWN: Aye? Then she's obviously not got enough to do.
ARCHIE: You work the system right, you could ask her yourself. Just be thankful you're not working for Household. The Queen never lets them out of her sight. But wee spats like us can slip through the net, easy. A beat. BROWN stares straight at him.
BROWN: I'm no wee spat, ARCHIE.
VICTORIA: ( as if she had not seem him Who is that? Lady Ely peers through the rain.
LADY ELY: It's Mr Brown, ma'am.
VICTORIA: What is he doing there?
LADY ELY: He appears to be . standing by his I made no request to go out riding How long has he been there?
VICTORIA: I made no request to go out riding How long has he been there?
LADY ELY: I don't know, ma'am. He was observed earlier, I believe. At this moment, PONSONBY comes down the corridor.
VICTORIA: Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the courtyard. I have no wish to go I'm very sorry, ma'am. I can't imagine he was certainly given no Please make sure it does not happen Of course, at once. VICTORIA takes one last look and walks away.
PONSONBY: I'm very sorry, ma'am. I can't imagine he was certainly given no Please make sure it does not happen Of course, at once. VICTORIA takes one last look and walks away.
VICTORIA: Please make sure it does not happen Of course, at once. VICTORIA takes one last look and walks away.
PONSONBY: Of course, at once. VICTORIA takes one last look and walks away.
PONSONBY: What on earth did you think you were BROWN stares straight back.
BROWN: Awaiting my orders.
PONSONBY: You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it. You know that very I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.
BROWN: I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.
PONSONBY: You will await your orders like everyone else. Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little I beg your pardon?
BROWN: I beg your pardon?
PONSONBY: I beg your pardon?
PONSONBY: I thought I made myself perfectly clear. You do not leave your room until Her Majesty requests it.
BROWN: ( eyes straight ahead, Well, you tell Her Majesty from me, if her husband was here now, he'd have had her out of that house and getting some air in her. What the hell's the point in me being here otherwise?! From the window above, VICTORIA takes in his words. A beat. PONSONBY collects himself.
PONSONBY: Go inside at once.
BROWN: Is that the Queen's request?
PONSONBY: Yes, it most certainly is! BROWN turns, grabs the lead rein and leads his horse back to the stables.
VICTORIA: Mr Brown.
BROWN: Yes, ma'am.
VICTORIA: You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
BROWN: Yes, ma'am.
VICTORIA: Then why do you persist in doing it?
BROWN: Because I think Her Majesty is wrong. If ever there was a poor soul who needed fresh air, it is her. A beat.
VICTORIA: The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.
BROWN: And I intend to be there when she's Silence. The two of them stare at each other.
VICTORIA: Prince Albert was going to build a bench here. He thought it one of the best views in Osborne.
BROWN: It's a fine spot, ma'am.
VICTORIA: He thought so, yes. She stares ahead.
BROWN: If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two.
VICTORIA: Sir Henry is not alone. They all wish The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank She stops again, cutting quickly back to small-talk.
BROWN: Aye, ma'am.
VICTORIA: A pause.
BERTIE'S VALET: Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits Not now he doesn't. This is my place.
BROWN: Not now he doesn't. This is my place.
BERTIE'S VALET: By whose authority?
BROWN: My own. A little frisson of oh-my-gawdness. BERTIE'S VALET stares icily at him.
BERTIE'S VALET: The order of seating at the Upper Servant's table is arranged personally by the Queen herself.
BROWN: That's a tautology lad. If you say the Queen arranges something, you've no need to say she's done it personally. That's But as far as BERTIE'S VALET is concerned, it isn't. He stares down in mute fury, then snaps his fingers at one of the under servants, who rushes over. There is a hurried exchange of whispers before the under servant rushes out. Unperturbed, BROWN brings out his flask and pours himself a substantial draft of whiskey. He turns to the pretty assistant dresser, sitting to his right.
ASSISTANT DRESSER: Assistant, sir, yes. BROWN tucks into his soup. Everyone watches and waits.
BROWN: What's your name?
ASSISTANT DRESSER: Mary Taylor, sir.
BROWN: Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?
ASSISTANT DRESSER: I hope to go up next year.
BROWN: You wouldn't happen to know what the Queen's reading for recreation, would you, Mary? The assistant dresser thinks for a moment.
ASSISTANT DRESSER: Lord Tennyson, sir? BROWN nods. All conversation stops as the under servant bursts back in. She halts at the door, looking blankly from Bertie's valet to the elderly butler. A beat. The old man stiffens and makes his way to the middle of the BROWN looks up from his soup.
BROWN: Am I the only one eating? With a clatter of spoons, everyone obediently eats.
PONSONBY: Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation, at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. Dispatches, as usual, at two. The Chancellor writes to say that, by happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes for the weekend. He asks if Your Majesty might grant him an audience.
VICTORIA: He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.
PONSONBY: He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.
VICTORIA: No. I shall be out walking. A beat. BERTIE watches closely now. PONSONBY coughs again, nervous.
PONSONBY: Then perhaps Your Majesty might consider it opportune if the Prince of Wales were to meet him on your behalf? VICTORIA stiffens. She speaks without turning.
VICTORIA: On no account. PONSONBY gives up. Politely, but firmly, BERTIE takes up the reins.
BERTIE: Mama, I really do think it's time we made ourselves a little more . VICTORIA carries on knitting.
VICTORIA: I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?
BERTIE: I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?
VICTORIA: ( cutting in firmly ) No dinners, Bertie. ( beat ) Why are you dressed for outdoors?
BERTIE: It's so infernally cold in here.
VICTORIA: Cold is good Is that not so, Dr. Jenner?!
JENNER: I'm sorry, ma'am?
VICTORIA: Cold is good!
JENNER: Excellent, ma'am, excellent. But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity.
VICTORIA: ( becoming very agitated ) Why am I being lectured in this way?!
JENNER: Forgive me, Your Majesty. In no way did I wish to suggest
VICTORIA: ( cutting across him ) I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the . Least of all my son. It was his irresponsibility that drove my husband to his grave. An appalled silence. With great dignity, BERTIE absorbs the shock of the insult and quietly steers the conversation in another direction.

VICTORIA: . Least of all my son. It was his irresponsibility that drove my husband to his grave. An appalled silence. With great dignity, BERTIE absorbs the shock of the insult and quietly steers the conversation in another direction.
BERTIE: If it is inconvenient to Her Majesty, then perhaps she might consider allowing the Prince of Wales to host
VICTORIA: I do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me. Doctor Jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box! Silence. VICTORIA has crossed to the window and stares out at the view. Having recovered her composure, she turns to address them all.
VICTORIA: Don't potter, children. Swim. Hold for a moment on the princesses' miserable faces.
BROWN: You could buy that lot for garden ornaments and still see change from ten guineas. The household do not hear this, but QUEEN VICTORIA has overheard and tries to suppress a smile. As she settles into the saddle, her foot comes loose. BROWN fastens it into the stirrups.
STANLEY: Have you seen this?
STANLEY: Should we take it seriously?
DISRAELI: The cartoon or Her Majesty's Well, both.
STANLEY: Well, both.
DISRAELI: The question is, do we need her?
STANLEY: Surely, you're not suggesting we My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion. The pass GLADSTONE in a huddle of cohorts.
DISRAELI: My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion. The pass GLADSTONE in a huddle of cohorts.
STANLEY: We'll see which way the wind blows. DISRAELI sweeps through a prattle of back-benchers.
DISRAELI: We'll see which way the wind blows. DISRAELI sweeps through a prattle of back-benchers.
BROWN: My heart's in the Highlands, my heart is not here! My heart's in the Highlands a-chasing the deer! Chasing the wild deer and following the roe! My heart's in the Highlands wherever I ARCHIE is so creased up with laughing, he almost drowns.
BROWN: One box of biscuits, one box of drop tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen chocolate sponges. It's the same order every week, but does anybody bother to check it? Now she has to travel all the way to Balmoral without the few luxuries she actually enjoys.
ARCHIE: So? Someone'll send it on ahead.
BROWN: Aye, but will they?
ARCHIE: John, it's not your problem what she The woman's surrounded by fools! She has to be packed and ready to leave by seven thirty tomorrow morning. Knowing that lot, they'll still be dressing her at eight. BROWN takes a nip of whiskey and offers some to his She's got an army of people to get her up and out.

ARCHIE: She's got an army of people to get her up and out.
BROWN: But I'm the only one she trusts. ARCHIE stares at him. A beat.
ARCHIE: She'll blow hot and cold on you, John, she always does. You want to be I'm on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan I'd be wearing anyway. That's as much as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and that job's only for toffs. I'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant! Indoors and Out. There's no stopping me now.

PONSONBY: Oh God, not the pipes!
VICTORIA: What are those?
BROWN: Those, over there, there.
VICTORIA: Those, over there, there.
BROWN: ( horse chestnut trees. ) ( beat ) ( bursts out laughing ) How can I possibly say that with a straight face?! BROWN lets it go and they ride on.
VICTORIA: ( beat ) ( bursts out laughing ) How can I possibly say that with a straight face?! BROWN lets it go and they ride on.
BROWN: Are they worth reading?
VICTORIA: ( beat ) I am told so.
BROWN: Who by?
VICTORIA: Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are What does he know about the Highlands?
BROWN: What does he know about the Highlands?
VICTORIA: He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.
BROWN: That doesn't make him an expert.
VICTORIA: His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its I don't groom a horse to have it admired by others, I groom it because it needs grooming.
BROWN: I don't groom a horse to have it admired by others, I groom it because it needs grooming.
VICTORIA: ( curtly ) I do not do it for others. But Ponsonby thinks they are good.
BROWN: Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn't matter to you.
VICTORIA: ( snapping ) Of course I shall say what I have to say. I always do. The stare at each other until BROWN kicks his horse on.
BROWN: Aye, well, if all you want is a good opinion then he'd be sure to oblige What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit, a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming. Literary appreciation does not begin and end with Tennyson. BROWN lowers his head.
VICTORIA: ( riding alongside ) What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit, a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming. ( beat ) Literary appreciation does not begin and end with Tennyson. BROWN lowers his head.
BROWN: ( briskly ) She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt. If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before. She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.
PONSONBY: She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
BROWN: That can wait till the weekend.
PONSONBY: There are important papers from
BROWN: It can wait. Anything else?
JENNER: Are you sure Her Majesty is up to such a long journey? She has only just recovered from a severe head cold.
BROWN: If I thought she wasn't up to it, I wouldn't let her go, would I? BROWN snaps together his papers and walks out, leaving PONSONBY and DOCTOR JENNER standing lamely at the table.
BERTIE: Surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop.
VICTORIA: It is a disgusting habit, Bertie. It should be discouraged.
BERTIE: Yes, but isn't midnight a little It is quite late enough.
VICTORIA: It is quite late enough.
BERTIE: But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose. It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already. He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
VICTORIA: ( cutting in angrily ) Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already. He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
BERTIE: And that is my last word on the Well, I'm sorry, but I really do think it's too much that the gentlemen of the house should be dictated to by a It's the Queen's decision.
VICTORIA: And that is my last word on the Well, I'm sorry, but I really do think it's too much that the gentlemen of the house should be dictated to by a It's the Queen's decision.
BERTIE: Well, I'm sorry, but I really do think it's too much that the gentlemen of the house should be dictated to by a It's the Queen's decision.
BROWN: It's the Queen's decision.
BERTIE: I beg your pardon? Before Bertie can continue, BROWN steps right into his I think you should go now. You've tired your mother enough. BERTIE stares back, too stunned to speak. He glances at his mother, but VICTORIA looks off into the distance as if she has not heard. BERTIE turns and storms away.
BROWN: I think you should go now. You've tired your mother enough. BERTIE stares back, too stunned to speak. He glances at his mother, but VICTORIA looks off into the distance as if she has not heard. BERTIE turns and storms away.
BROWN: There's really no need for this.
MRS GRANT: I'll not have her seeing it like it I know she means well, but I wish she'd warn us she was coming.
BROWN: She thinks if she warned you, you'd go pouring water on the fire and stuffing the knitting under the sofa.
MR GRANT: Aye, well, you can't stop a wife being MRS GRANT surveys the room critically.
MRS GRANT: All right. Show her in.
BROWN: They're ready now.
VICTORIA: I hope they didn't go to any trouble, Ah, well.
BROWN: Ah, well.
VICTORIA: Mr Grant. How good it is to see you.
MR GRANT: ( bowing deeply ) Your Majesty.
VICTORIA: Mrs Grant. How is your knee? Has the pain eased a little?
MRS GRANT: ( bobbing in terror ) Oh not so bad, ma'am.
VICTORIA: Good. Oh and here are Douglas and John. Haven't you grown?
MRS GRANT: ( still bobbing away ) Growing all the time, ma'am. MR GRANT remembers himself and gestures VICTORIA towards a Will you sit, ma'am? From his place by the wall, BROWN notices how easily she smiles as she is led to the chair. She points to a picture on the wall and her good humour is infectious.
MR GRANT: Will you sit, ma'am? From his place by the wall, BROWN notices how easily she smiles as she is led to the chair. She points to a picture on the wall and her good humour is infectious.
VICTORIA: I know that! That's Cairn Lochan. We picnicked there once, did we not, INT. A SOCIETY PARTY, LONDON - DAY A few days later, a party of ARISTOCRATS, MINISTERS, DIPLOMATS, ESCORTS, BUSINESSMAN and WHORES. Into this brouhaha come DISRAELI, his elderly wife MARY ANNE and the young STANLEY. It is all eyes and nods here. Everyone knows everyone.
DISRAELI: Ah, the greasy pole.
MARY ANNE: Don't be facetious, dear. Remember your position.
DISRAELI: It's my position I'm thinking of. Across the room, STANLEY spots BERTIE amid a crowd of I see the Prince of Wales is here.
STANLEY: I see the Prince of Wales is here.
DISRAELI: I hope he got his mother's permission. STANLEY smiles faintly. DISRAELI homes in on a punter and raises his hand, already working the room.
DISRAELI: And in your opinion? Is she foolish? The SOCIETY LADY stares blankly back.
DISRAELI: SOCIETY LADY 1 Well, the Queen and ( appalled whisper ) Mr Brown. DISRAELI stares at her steadily, already thinking ahead.
DISRAELI: La superstition met le monde entier en I beg your pardon?
DISRAELI: ( changing tack ) Has anybody seen this . Mr Brown?
STANLEY: He is her personal servant, I believe.
DISRAELI: He would hardly make a very good personal assistant if he did not.
MRS GRANT: . it's not my best china. I mean, it is my best china now, but the family set got stolen last summer.
VICTORIA: Oh, I'm so sorry .
MRS GRANT: Of course it was no-one on the Estate. More likely one of the lads from Braemar. Or further even. I'll fetch the salt. MRS GRANT scurries away. VICTORIA immediately holds up the spoons to BROWN with a questioning look above or beside the plate? He nods her to the top and she quickly carries INT. A SOCIETY PARTY, LONDON - DAY DISRAELI and MARY ANNE stand with BERTIE and his ACOLYTES.
BERTIE: Mr Disraeli. Ma'am.
DISRAELI: Your Royal Highness. What a pleasure to see you here.
BERTIE: Have you met Mr Lyle? He's in I don't think I've had that pleasure. DISRAELI shakes hands with the fat sugar tycoon who wobbles with drink. MARY ANNE engages him in conversation while BERTIE turns DISRAELI aside.
DISRAELI: I don't think I've had that pleasure. DISRAELI shakes hands with the fat sugar tycoon who wobbles with drink. MARY ANNE engages him in conversation while BERTIE turns DISRAELI aside.
BERTIE: No doubt you've heard the rumors.
DISRAELI: I take no account of gossip, Your My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
BERTIE: My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
DISRAELI: Of course.
BERTIE: I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest She's having a bust cast of him. In Nero Marquino marble.
DISRAELI: I see.
BERTIE: I would talk to her myself, but she won't listen to me. She must be persuaded, by someone she respects, to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops.
DISRAELI: A situation?
BERTIE: I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs. But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence. The Tory Party has always been our I'm flattered you think so.
DISRAELI: I'm flattered you think so.
BERTIE: I tell you, if we don't stick together on this, you could find yourself First President's Opposition. Du Royaum Uni.
DISRAELI: A beat.
BERTIE: I don't think we can overstate the seriousness of this. DISRAELI nods and BERTIE walks swiftly back to his party. The moment he's gone, STANLEY steps up to DISRAELI's side.
STANLEY: What did he want?
DISRAELI: To know when he'll be king.
BROWN: . so Grant here and myself are riding over Lochnagar and the rain's pouring down in sheets and all we're thinking about is getting home for a drink, when through the gloom Grant spots a couple of poachers. He gives me a shout and we chase them down towards the loch until Grant has your men up against the stacks and he's shouting and cursing at them, "Why are you poaching on Royal land?!" And one of the little fellas looks up at him and says, "coz we've come up in the For a split second, both the GRANTS look petrified, then BROWN and VICTORIA explode into laughter and the GRANTS relax. Suddenly the GRANTS are helpless with laughter too. Beginning with VICTORIA's glass, BROWN pours out liberal quantities of whiskey all round.
JENNER: Your Majesty! Thank goodness you're safe! I'll have a bath prepared immediately. I recommend Macdonald's African Embrocation
BROWN: ( cutting in ) Ah, pipe down, man. The woman's fine.
VICTORIA: We stayed a little longer than expected with Mr and Mrs Grant. It was most agreeable.
PONSONBY: We were expecting you to return by And now I am back. BROWN cannot resist one more little dig.
VICTORIA: And now I am back. BROWN cannot resist one more little dig.
BROWN: We took a nip of whiskey.
VICTORIA: To keep out the cold.
BROWN: VICTORIA smiles and BROWN lifts her off the trap. Before walking in she turns and, in front of everyone, says.
VICTORIA: Thank you, John. BROWN bows and the QUEEN walks on. As she straightens up, he finds PONSONBY and DOCTOR JENNER staring back at him in utter disbelief at what she has just said. He turns and leads the horse back to the stables.
JENNER: ( under his breath ) She's drunk. PONSONBY doesn't answer. He is watching BROWN very A distinct flushing around the cheeks. She was drunk, I tell you.
PONSONBY: No, she wasn't. Silence. JENNER turns to look at PONSONBY.
JENNER: Surely not . PONSONBY's face is set hard.
PONSONBY: Don't even think about it.
JENNER: Pandora's Box . With a slam of feet the reel ends, the GHILLIES roar and BROWN and VICTORIA stand smiling at each other in silence. A King and his Queen.
VICTORIA: What is it, John? I heard something. BROWN's eyes fix on some distant gorse bushes.
BROWN: I heard something. BROWN's eyes fix on some distant gorse bushes.
JOURNALIST 1: Where did he get to? I've lost him? Below them, BROWN races across the riverbank and undergrowth, unseen.
JOURNALIST 2: I don't know if there's much worth writing about.
JOURNALIST 1: Hard to tell. BROWN rears up above them and stops.
BROWN: This close enough for you? Go on! On your way! You filthy scavengers! The JOURNALISTS scramble to their feet and start legging it down the hill, while BROWN roars furiously, hurling their bags after them.
BROWN: If I catch the miserable by-blow who told those men where she'd be, then I'll hang his balls to dry on Jock Wemyss, so I will!! ARCHIE glances up at BERTIE'S VALET. He is staring down at the table, teeth gritted, fists clenched. BROWN rounds on them all again.
BERTIE'S VALET: You'll talk when I'm finished! BERTIE'S VALET stares at him in astonishment. BROWN turns back to the table.
BROWN: You'll talk when I'm finished! BERTIE'S VALET stares at him in astonishment. BROWN turns back to the table.
JENNER: "Court Circular, Balmoral." "On Tuesday, Mr John Brown enjoyed a display of sheep-dipping by local farmers. On Wednesday, he attended a seance where he was pleased to listen to a recital of Auld Lang Syne by Mr Robert Burns himself ."
BROWN: If I find out that you had anything to do with this, I will have you sacked.
PONSONBY: I believe that decision rests with Her Don't think I can't persuade her.
BROWN: Don't think I can't persuade her.
PONSONBY: I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused. She has always had a very healthy sense of humor.
BROWN: This is a slur on her good name.
PONSONBY: In as much as the article is about yourself, I think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you.
BROWN: Nobody has any rights over me.
PONSONBY: We are all of us subject to forces beyond our control, Mr Brown, even BROWN stares at him in silence. A beat.
BROWN: You'll regret saying that.
COUNTER: Ayes to the right, three hundred and thirty, noes to the left, two hundred and sixty-five. By the time he reaches "sixty-five" his voice is drowned in cheers from the Liberal benches. DISRAELI and the rest of the front bench sit in stony silence. Somewhere on the Liberal back benches, a wild-eyed maverick, DILKE, rises to his feet shouting:
DILKE: Mr Speaker, I table a motion in furtherance of the Bill to Disestablish the Monarchy! A roar from the irate TORIES and chaos reigns again.
SPEAKER: Order! Order!! ORDER!!!
DISRAELI: We're going to lose.
STANLEY: You can't know that for sure.
DISRAELI: Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help. Where is the old girl?
STANLEY: Mrs Brown.
DISRAELI: Mrs Brown.
STANLEY: It's questionable whether there's any advantage to be had from that direction. She's never been less In the press, perhaps. But she's sold more copies of her Highland Journal in three months than Punch will ever sell in a year. Time to wheel her out.
DISRAELI: In the press, perhaps. But she's sold more copies of her Highland Journal in three months than Punch will ever sell in a year. Time to wheel her out.
STANLEY: She's refusing to leave Balmoral.
DISRAELI: What's her excuse this time?
STANLEY: The Princess Louisa is too ill to move. Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad You're smiling.
DISRAELI: I was trying to imagine "rather The elderly prelate, DEAN WELLSELLY, hurries in through the lobby doors. DISRAELI puts on a welcoming smile.
DEAN WELLSELLY: Forgive me, gentlemen. I'm late.
DISRAELI: Not at all, Dean. Good of you to spare the time.
DEAN WELLSELLY: I came as quickly as I could.
DISRAELI: You've seen the latest cartoon in Punch, I take it?
DEAN WELLSELLY: ( completely lost ) I beg your pardon? DISRAELI opens the copy of Punch and hands it to Dean Wellselly. The Dean clears his throat and starts to read.
DISRAELI: ( as Wellselly reads ) One of our madder brethren in the house was calling for disestablishment of the monarchy. Dean Wellselly looks up from the article, horrified.
DEAN WELLSELLY: Good Lord.
STANLEY: ( playing the soft glove ) I'm sure it won't come to that.
DISRAELI: ( the hard glove ) No. But it has now become a matter for our consciences. ( beat ) I was just telling Stanley how vital it is that the nation should feel the visible influence of the Sovereign. As a reminder that Parliament, indeed my own ministry, depends on the will of the Queen. DEAN WELLSELLY nods his head gravely. Over his shoulder, STANLEY is gaping at DISRAELI's silky distortion of the party political maneuver into a moral imperative.
DEAN WELLSELLY: I couldn't agree with you more, but I am only Dean of Windsor. I don't understand what . DISRAELI interrupts.
DISRAELI: We hear from Balmoral that Mr Brown is interesting Her Majesty in some of the forms of worship associated with . low-church Presbyterian. Silence. DEAN WELLSELLY'S face is a picture of unrestrained horror. Low-church. Presbyterian.
DEAN WELLSELLY: What can we do?
DISRAELI: Oh, several things.
VICTORIA: Read it.
PONSONBY: Read it! PONSONBY coughs once and begins again.
VICTORIA: Read it! PONSONBY coughs once and begins again.
PONSONBY: "The Times wishes to join the rest of Her Majesty's loyal subjects in expressing its deep joy at the news that the Queen is soon to come out of her mourning." VICTORIA glowers at him.
VICTORIA: Who told them that?
PONSONBY: I have no idea.
VICTORIA: Why not?
PONSONBY: I forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself. Suddenly, VICTORIA's temper goes and she shouts at him.
VICTORIA: No-one should think themselves wiser than me! It is not for any of the Queen's subjects to presume to tell Her Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning. It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded! It is Her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely!
PONSONBY: Your Majesty
VICTORIA: ( cutting right through him ) Is it not enough that She is uncheered and unguided that she should also have to suffer these malicious rumors?! ( a pause, more quietly ) I am not a fool. ( beat ) I know there are those in the establishment too afraid to attack me and so they attack my dearest friends. Sometimes I feel that Brown is all I have left of Albert. ( beat ) And now they attack Brown too. She looks up, eyes blazing.
BERTIE: I wish to see my mother.
BROWN: She's busy.
BERTIE: Convey her a message.
BROWN: She's away to Windsor tomorrow. Talk to her there.
BERTIE: Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press.
BROWN: Are you deaf as well as stupid? A split-second. BERTIE gapes at him.
BERTIE: What did you say?
BROWN: I said, are you deaf as well as Do you know who you address, sir?
BERTIE: Do you know who you address, sir?
BROWN: Whom you address.
BERTIE: The future King! A beat.
BROWN: Well, everyone's entitled to their Out of my way! Foolishly, BERTIE tries to barge his way past. Suddenly BROWN loses it completely. He grabs the Prince of Wales by the shoulders and pins him back, shouting right into his LEAVE US ALONE, WHY DON'T YOU!! For a split-second, BROWN's eyes flicker as he senses he has gone too far. A look of pure venom in BERTIE'S face, then .

BROWN: You! What's your business here?!
BROWN: Well, don't stand where you shouldn't! The UNDER-PORTER scrambles up the stairs. A few SERVANTS exchange looks. BROWN seems more determined than ever to exert his control.
VICTORIA: Must they always follow us?
BROWN: I ordered it. It's for your own Dear me, you'll be telling me to watch what I eat next. BROWN doesn't react. A beat.
VICTORIA: Dear me, you'll be telling me to watch what I eat next. BROWN doesn't react. A beat.
BROWN: ( looking away ) But there are Fenians reported on the ( tutting irritably ) The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
VICTORIA: ( tutting irritably ) The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
BROWN: ( snapping back ) I'll decide when it's exaggerated. BROWN chucks his horse on, bringing a firm halt to the conversation. A beat. He pulls up suddenly, staring at the shadows in the copse.
VICTORIA: Is anything the matter, John? He stares for along moment and then lets it go.
BROWN: Nothing's the matter.
BROWN: Hey, Barney.
BARNEY: Mr Brown, sir
BROWN: It's cold out there tonight, Barney. Reaching his pony, BROWN stops and smiles. The animal lifts its face to him and he softly strokes his muzzle.
BARNEY: Yeah, yeah, I did.
BROWN: Good man. And is she all right?
BARNEY: Good. She's a good girl. Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl. And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
BROWN: Good. She's a good girl. Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl. And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
BARNEY: ( beat ) Are you all right, Barney? BARNEY twitches again and BROWN realizes too late. The split-second he turns, he sees THREE MEN.
BROWN: ( beat ) Are you all right, Barney? BARNEY twitches again and BROWN realizes too late. The split-second he turns, he sees THREE MEN.
VICTORIA: LADY ELY Mr Brown is unable to attend today.
LADY ELY: Mr Brown is unable to attend today.
VICTORIA: LADY ELY I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
LADY ELY: I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
VICTORIA: LADY ELY I understand he was in a fight.
LADY ELY: I understand he was in a fight.
VICTORIA: Has he been hurt?
LADY ELY: I believe not, ma'am. I understand he'd had rather too much to drink. VICTORIA walks away and steps behind her desk.
VICTORIA: You may go. LADY ELY bows and walks out. VICTORIA stares at the desk a moment, then picks up her pen and tries to work. She INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - DAY BROWN sits on the edge of the bed in only his undergarments. His face, arms, legs and fingers are livid with bruises, but he sits there, stiff-backed and gritting his teeth, while ARCHIE crouches in front of him, tending to his wounds.
BROWN: And she sent no word down?
ARCHIE: They said you were drunk. Why don't you tell her the truth?
BROWN: She'll think it's her fault for keeping me. ARCHIE completes one of the dressings when BROWN suddenly reaches back and starts trying to put on his shirt.
ARCHIE: What are you doing?!
BROWN: I'm getting dressed.
ARCHIE: You've got three broken ribs, man!
BROWN: I've got my duties to attend to.
ARCHIE: Don't be an idiot! You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
BROWN: She'll be worried about me.
ARCHIE: She'll get over it.
BROWN: I can't let her down now, Archie.
ARCHIE: And when was the last time she put herself out for you? Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
BROWN: Oh, I'm much more than that.
ARCHIE: Aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants.
BROWN: You watch your tongue.
ARCHIE: Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
BROWN: You know nothing about her!
ARCHIE: When are you gonna see it, John? She doesn't give a damn about you. BROWN lunges for the bedside drawer and pulls out a card showing a coy picture of a pretty woman. He holds it up, eyes blazing.
BROWN: From the Queen! He reads out the inscription.
ARCHIE: She means it. ARCHIE stares at him.
BROWN: She means it. ARCHIE stares at him.
ARCHIE: She'll drop you. When she's done with you, she'll drop you.
BROWN: Get out. ARCHIE steps back but BROWN roars at him.
OUT!!: ARCHIE steps outside and BROWN is left alone.
PONSONBY: . to be followed by a visit from Lady Bridport. She is keen to secure a place for her niece as Maid of VICTORIA signs the last letter and sits back.
VICTORIA: I am tired. PONSONBY coughs.
PONSONBY: There is one other matter.
VICTORIA: What is it?
PONSONBY: I have a letter, ma'am.
VICTORIA: From whom?
PONSONBY: From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
VICTORIA: ( stiffening defensively ) My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in PONSONBY does not reply. Finally, VICTORIA is obliged to What do they want?
PONSONBY: They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness. VICTORIA stares through the window, expressionless.
DEAN WELLSELLY: You wished to see me, ma'am? She holds his eyes for a moment, then nods.
VICTORIA: My husband tried always to make me think more subtly. Of course he taught me so much and I can never repay my debt to him, or the love I feel, even now. But, in truth, I think I am someone who can only feel things while they are alive to me. For that reason, I know I do not have a subtle mind. I know that. But I work hard and I try to do my duty. However, I have noticed of late that my feelings of grief are not so strong and that I find myself leaning more upon the comfort of living friends. Friends close to me now. She stops herself. She is crying. DEAN WELLSELLY watches her a moment, then speaks close, choosing his words Your Majesty, a settled resignation is more lasting proof of affection than active grief. If the good Lord sees fit to bring one into contact with congenial fellow beings, one should not analyze one's reaction too deeply. To allow oneself to be comforted by someone else need not imply any disloyalty to the memory of the loved Silence. VICTORIA stares into the long, dark chapel. Gradually, as she takes in the tone of his remarks, her disappointment turns to anger.

VICTORIA: Sir Henry. PONSONBY steps forward.
PONSONBY: Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort. Do I make myself clear?
VICTORIA: Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort. Do I make myself clear?
PONSONBY: A beat.
VICTORIA: You may go. They all file out.
VICTORIA: I would like to get down. Without a word, BROWN dismounts and helps her off her Yes, ma'am?
BROWN: Yes, ma'am?
VICTORIA: I was told you were in a fight.
BROWN: Yes, ma'am.
VICTORIA: Has someone seen to those bruises?
BROWN: Yes, ma'am. A beat.
VICTORIA: Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign.
BROWN: Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign.
VICTORIA: I do not accept. A beat.
BROWN: I had foreseen that you would not. But Your Majesty should understand that my mind will not be changed in this. I leave for Deeside
VICTORIA: ( cutting in ) The Queen forbids it. ( beat ) I cannot allow it because I cannot live without you. Without you, I cannot find the strength to be who I must be. Please. She takes his hand to her mouth and kisses it gently, then looks at him, utterly helpless.
BROWN: I promise.
VICTORIA: How dare the Irish break with the If Albert were alive today he would never allow the Crown to give up Church patronage. No, the Irish must be told, very firmly, to stay exactly where they are. It is the thin edge of the wedge, Mr Disraeli. Next, you will be telling me that the Crown no longer governs this nation. A beat. A nervous silence in the Household.
DISRAELI: Your Majesty remains at the very epicenter of governance. As for your people, look no further than the sales of your Highland Journals to see in what affection the nation holds their You sell even more copies than Mr But I lack your prose, Mr Disraeli. VICTORIA gives him a tiny smile. DISRAELI acknowledges it, then steers the conversation back.
VICTORIA: But I lack your prose, Mr Disraeli. VICTORIA gives him a tiny smile. DISRAELI acknowledges it, then steers the conversation back.
DISRAELI: Of course I understand your concern. You miss your people. And they miss you. VICTORIA registers a slight flicker of defensiveness at the implied criticism.
VICTORIA: Then they may read about me.
DISRAELI: Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
VICTORIA: Is that not enough?
DISRAELI: In so many ways . and yet it is your presence they crave. A figurehead. VICTORIA has the measure of him.
VICTORIA: I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli. You, I thought, understood a widow's grief.
DISRAELI: Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for the nation, only for myself. As Prime Minister I confess I miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and I should not burden you with it. The Household waits. Has he clawed himself back? VICTORIA acknowledges his apology. Her voice drops and she talks directly to DISRAELI, straight from the heart.
VICTORIA: I stay here because I am happy. Is that such a terrible crime?
DISRAELI: No, ma'am. At this moment the far door opens and BROWN walks in.
BROWN: Time for your walk. Without a word, VICTORIA rises from her chair and starts following him out. As they pass DISRAELI, she stops.
VICTORIA: This is my good John Brown.
DISRAELI: ( taking him in ) I have asked him to show you a little of Highland life while you are with us at Balmoral. BROWN measures DISRAELI suspiciously.
VICTORIA: I have asked him to show you a little of Highland life while you are with us at Balmoral. BROWN measures DISRAELI suspiciously.
BROWN: What brings you here?
DISRAELI: A man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen. It was remiss of me not to come earlier. VICTORIA smiles. BROWN stares.
BROWN: What do you know about the Highlands?
DISRAELI: I am a blank sheet.
BROWN: Do you hunt?
DISRAELI: Dare say you can be taught.
BROWN: Dare say you can be taught.
DISRAELI: To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
BROWN: If you hunt, you kill. DISRAELI counters effortlessly.
DISRAELI: Well then, I'll do my best.
BROWN: ( demonstrating with his Always remember, you keep it tight to your shoulder, you absorb the kick. Aim for the head. Then imagine it's ( smiling ) BROWN pulls out his flask and offers some to DISRAELI, who declines. He watches BROWN take a long swig.
DISRAELI: ( smiling ) BROWN pulls out his flask and offers some to DISRAELI, who declines. He watches BROWN take a long swig.
BROWN: ( ticking as he goes ) . Back doors, West Wing.
BROWN: Side doors, East Wing.
ASSISTANT DRESSER: Checked and locked, sir.
BROWN: Louder, girl!
ASSISTANT DRESSER: ( creasing up ) Checked and locked, sir.
BROWN: Kitchen and lower house.
BERTIE'S VALET: Checked and locked, sir.
BROWN: Back and upper corridors.
BROWN: Front door. Checked and locked. Folding up the paper, BROWN downs his glass of whiskey and sits. On his nod, dinner is served by UNDER SERVANTS amid a clatter of cutlery and chat. ARCHIE looks across at his brother but BROWN is hunched over his plate, pecking at his food. Someone titters and ARCHIE looks up. BERTIE'S VALET coughs. BROWN slowly lifts his head. His eyes have the slightly unfocused look of too much drink. It is clear to ARCHIE that he is about to be sent-up.
BERTIE'S VALET: ( with a smug smile ) Did you see any Irish assassins today, Mr Brown? Brown doesn't react.
BROWN: There's not a soul here cares about that wee woman's safety except me! She'd die in a ditch if I wasn't there to look out for her He stops. ARCHIE has come across to his brother's chair and pulls gently on his arm. BROWN stares at the SERVANTS. Everyone is about to burst out laughing. Keeping his dignity, he pushes back his chair and lets ARCHIE lead him away. As BROWN reaches the double doors, the laughter hits him in the back like a wave. ARCHIE holds him steady.
ARCHIE: What's this?
BROWN: It's a diary.
ARCHIE: Be careful who sees it.
BROWN: What do you take me for? ARCHIE turns back to BROWN.
ARCHIE: You should have someone look after I'm all right. I just need to rest up a wee bit. The room . You don't have to stay. BROWN shuts his eyes and starts to drift. ARCHIE watches over him.
BROWN: I'm all right. I just need to rest up a wee bit. The room . You don't have to stay. BROWN shuts his eyes and starts to drift. ARCHIE watches over him.
ARCHIE: The place is a mess.
BROWN: I can't move to tidy.
ARCHIE: It's what the maids are for.
BROWN: I'm not having some prattler going through my things. A beat.
ARCHIE: Won't you give yourself a rest, John? She's other people to look out for She needs me, Archie. She canna do without me, she said it to my face. How can I stop now?
BROWN: She needs me, Archie. She canna do without me, she said it to my face. How can I stop now?
BROWN: You sent for me.
DISRAELI: I've been called back to London. My last day. I thought I might take a walk on Lochnagar. BROWN stares straight back.
DISRAELI: Princes and Lords are but the breath of kings, An honest man's the noblest work of God. You must miss such magnificent views.
BROWN: I don't think about it. They reach the top and continue along the high ground. DISRAELI glances at BROWN and notices the limp.
DISRAELI: Forgive me, I've called you out and you should have been resting.
BROWN: I'm fine.
DISRAELI: You're injured.
BROWN: It's nothing.
DISRAELI: Still, someone must attend you. Your wife should not have let you out.
BROWN: I'm not married.
DISRAELI: ( deadpan ) This is the top. DISRAELI admires the view for a moment, then continues.
BROWN: This is the top. DISRAELI admires the view for a moment, then continues.
DISRAELI: I confess, I sometimes feel as if I am not married myself, I see my wife so little. But I'm forgetting the He looks across. BROWN keeps staring ahead.
BROWN: I wouldn't know.
DISRAELI: ( interrupts ) What I do, I do for my Queen.
BROWN: ( interrupts ) What I do, I do for my Queen.
DISRAELI: Was there never ambition?
BROWN: ( beat ) Maybe, once.
DISRAELI: Then I envy yo.
BROWN: To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.
DISRAELI: To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.
BROWN: I do what I do.
DISRAELI: For Her Majesty.
BROWN: But yourself? What about John Brown?
DISRAELI: But yourself? What about John Brown?
BROWN: I said. I serve the Queen.
DISRAELI: No other aspiration? BROWN stares for a long moment. Finally he speaks.
BROWN: To see her safe. DISRAELI steps a little closer.
DISRAELI: You will not be unaware of the threat now posed by Republicanism.
BROWN: Why do you think I keep her here?
DISRAELI: Ah, but therein lies the paradox. It is her very isolation that encourages the malcontents. The longer she is away, the stronger they become; and who, honestly, can promise security against that? However many doors you lock, someone will always get in. Even here. BROWN watches him, eyes alert.
BROWN: The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public. John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense.
DISRAELI: The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public. John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense.
BROWN: Her mind is set. She won't change She trusts you, John. DISRAELI is right on his shoulder now, like his own voice.
DISRAELI: She trusts you, John. DISRAELI is right on his shoulder now, like his own voice.
BROWN: They don't see it.
DISRAELI: See what?
BROWN: The threat. I tell them, but they don't see it.
DISRAELI: They aren't as watchful as you.
BROWN: Too busy looking after themselves.
DISRAELI: The greasy pole.
BROWN: No loyalty.
DISRAELI: No love. Silence. For a moment BROWN seems unaware that someone else has said that.
BROWN: I promised to protect her from people like you.
DISRAELI: For once in my life, I am not the She'll never understand it.
BROWN: She'll never understand it.
DISRAELI: In time, she will.
BROWN: She'll think I betrayed her.
DISRAELI: But others will know that you acted for the greater good. BROWN stares off into the distance.
VICTORIA: I received a letter today from Mr Disraeli. Parliament is calling for my return to public duties. Why won't they let us be? BROWN does not answer.
BROWN: We can't always have what we wish. VICTORIA stares at him.
VICTORIA: Duty?! You talk about duty?!
BROWN: If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.
VICTORIA: I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this Have I ever let you down before?
BROWN: ( cutting in ) Have I ever let you down before?
VICTORIA: ( as if he had not spoken ) You stand there and tell me it is my duty . after all you promised me!
BROWN: I'm breaking no promises!
VICTORIA: You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
BROWN: For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!
VICTORIA: I will not hear any more about my safety!! You made me a promise and now you have broken it! BROWN rounds on her, deeply wounded.
BROWN: When I took you out riding, come rain or shine, because I knew it was right for you, when I kept the bairns off your back so you could have a bit of peace, when I saw you safe from home to home and you didn't even know I was there.! All I've ever thought about is you!
VICTORIA: Then why send me back to them?!
BROWN: Because I have to! Will you no listen to me, woman? Face turned from him, VICTORIA replies in a brittle voice.
VICTORIA: Do not presume to talk to your Queen in that manner. A long silence. BROWN watches her, but she will not look at him again. Finally, she walks very slowly across the room. She turns in the doorway, her voice faltering Doctor Jenner, I feel unwell. I shall retire to my chamber. Please attend me presently. As the door slams, we .
PONSONBY: May I say, how glad I am to see Your Majesty so much recovered. VICTORIA nods, then turns and looks about at the others. PRINCESS ALEXANDRA is seated at the far end of the table. VICTORIA frowns.
VICTORIA: Where is my son?
PRINCESS ALEXANDRA: Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
VICTORIA: Why is he not here?
PRINCESS ALEXANDRA: He is sick, ma'am.
VICTORIA: Then why are you not with him?
PRINCESS ALEXANDRA: You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.
VICTORIA: What is the matter with him?
PRINCESS ALEXANDRA: He has typhoid fever, ma'am. VICTORIA stares blankly at DOCTOR JENNER.
VICTORIA: No. You are mistaken. Prince Albert, my husband, had typhoid fever. I asked what was wrong with my son.
JENNER: The same, your Majesty. VICTORIA stops. She stares down the length of the table. A long pause.
VICTORIA: Why was I not informed?
JENNER: I did not consider it wise, in the circumstances, to tax your nerves.
VICTORIA: How ill is he? No answer.
JENNER: VICTORIA lets out a deep breath. She takes hold of PRINCESS ALEXANDRA'S hand.
VICTORIA: Should the good Lord see fit to spare my son, I will order a mass to be celebrated at St. George's. The people must share with their Queen, her prayers and hopes for their future INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BEDCHAMBER - DAY A few minutes later, BROWN stands in the corridor when the door bursts open and VICTORIA marches straight past him with PONSONBY at her side.
PONSONBY: ( aside to BROWN ) The Queen will be riding to St. George's on the fifth.
BROWN: ( launching straight in ) I recommend Her Majesty uses the covered carriage with a full Horse Guard. In the event of any disturbance I will ensure
VICTORIA: ( cutting in ) I will ride to St. George's in an open carriage. It is time the Queen was seen by her public. VICTORIA turns and disappears down the corridor, followed by PONSONBY. We linger on BROWN'S humiliation, closer and closer until .
BROWN: He races toward O'CONNER and hits him flying, bangs him to the ground and twists the gun out of his hand. As they fall we hear laughter and:
NO!!: He races toward O'CONNER and hits him flying, bangs him to the ground and twists the gun out of his hand. As they fall we hear laughter and:
BERTIE: ( bristling with confidence ) . all seven stone of the man, paddling madly towards us through a sea of Horse Guards, waving something that looks vaguely like a pen. I thought he must be one of the mother's ardent readership in search of the Royal indenture. More chortling. VICTORIA watches her son, smiling proudly. BROWN looks straight ahead.
VICTORIA: I intend Brown to be rewarded with a special medal cast in gold. It will be called The Devoted Service Medal. The guests applaud politely. BERTIE clinks his glass for attention and raises it high.
BERTIE: A toast. Victoria Regina! The others raise their glasses in unison.
EVERYONE: Victoria Regina! VICTORIA smiles. BROWN remains alone by the door.
DISRAELI: . If the first great object of the Tory Party is to maintain the institutions of the country, the second is, in my opinion, to maintain the Empire of England . the hereditary, the traditionary policy of the Tory Party. Go to your homes, teach them these truths, which will soon be imprinted on the conscience of the land .
PAGE: North woods, sir. BROWN grabs his gun and rushes out.
BROWN: God save the Queen!! And fires.
VICTORIA: ( quietly ) How long has he been this sick?
LADY ELY: A few days, ma'am.
VICTORIA: Why was I not told earlier? LADY ELY doesn't answer. VICTORIA knows anyway. She nods. LADY ELY knocks. The door is opened by a young UNDER SERVANT who gawps at the sight of Her Majesty standing here in the servant's quarters. VICTORIA walks in.
VICTORIA: You should never have gone out in such foul weather.
BROWN: Someone has to look after you. It could've been someone. It was Yes. Yes it was. He cannot speak. It's difficult for her too, but she speaks for him.
VICTORIA: Yes. Yes it was. He cannot speak. It's difficult for her too, but she speaks for him.
BROWN: Don't be silly, woman. His old, familiar gruffness makes her smile and she pulls herself together. Seeing a bowl of water on the side table, she steps across. Carefully folding a cloth in four, she rinses it in the water and gently wipes his face. Leaning closer, she is about to touch his face when BROWN gestures protectively.
JENNER: Not too protracted, I hope.
PONSONBY: Not too protracted, I hope.
JENNER: ( shakes his head ) A few days. ( beat ) When he heard, the Prince of Wales threw the bust from the window of the Royal Gallery. It took four hours to gather the fragments. A beat.
PONSONBY: The Queen wishes to publish an account of him.
JENNER: Dear oh dear.
PONSONBY: We think she can be dissuaded. Have you had a glance at the diary?
JENNER: ( beat ) I think I'd best take it back.
PONSONBY: ( beat ) I think I'd best take it back.
JENNER: Of course. He brings out BROWN'S tatty diary-manuscript and hands it over to PONSONBY. The two men move away from the window, to go their separate ways. Daily business beckons.
PONSONBY: Some young page was boasting about having seen it. JENNER nods.
JENNER: Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.
PONSONBY: No, indeed. The two men head off in opposite directions down the Writers : Jeremy Brock
