KELLER: ( INDULGENT ) I've brought up two of them, but this is my wife's first, she isn't battle-scarred yet.
KATE: Doctor. Will my girl be all right?
0 DOCTOR: Oh, by morning she'll be knocking down Captain Kellerfs fences again.
KATE: Is there nothing we should do?
KELLER: ( JOVIAL ) Put up stronger fencing, ha?
DOCTOR: Just let her get well, she knows how to do it better than we do. These things come and go in infants, never know why. Call it acute congestion of the stomach and brain. KELL ? moves after the DOCTOR, we hear them off-camera; we see only KATE'S face hovering over us, her hand adjust- ing the blanket.
KELLER: I'll see you to your buggy, Doctor.
1. CONTINUED: DOCTOR ( OFF CAMERA ) 0 Main thing is the fever's gone. I've never seen a baby, more vitality, that's the truth Their voices and footsteps fade. KATE is bent lovingly over the crib, which emits a bleat; her finger is play- ful with the baby's face.
KATE: Hush. Don't you cry now, you've been trouble enough. Call it acute congestion, indeed, I don't see what's so cute about a con- gestion, just because it's yours? We'll have your father run an editorial in his paper, the wonders of modern medicine, they don't know what they're curing even when they cure it. Men, men and their battle scars, we women will have to Helen, Helen Captain, Captain, will you come. ( She screams )
KELLER: Katie, what's wrong?
KATE: ( CONTINUED ) c o.w- u UED She makes a pass with her hand in the crib, at the baby's KATE ( Cont'd ) She can't see. Look at her eyes. She takes the lamp from him, moves it before the child's She can't seel

KELLER: Helen. Heleni
KATE: She can't hear youl
YELLER: His face has something like fury in it, crying the child's name; KATE almost fainting presses her knuckles to her mouth, to stop her own cry.

FADE OUT: 5. DAY. INT. KELLEL HOUSE - TITLE SHOT. The stairs in the Keller House. In the foreground we see the bannisters, in the background the wall. A shadow.of the erratic, staggering figure of 5 year old HELEN appears on the wall, moving slowly. The two Negro children scamper past their excited laughter coming to us, in contrast to the mute HELEN. In CU, in the FG, HELEN'S little hands come into the frame, grasping the bannister 6. DAY. EXT.

HELEN lashes out, her face frightened, unknowing - she pulls down a sheet, be- comes tangled in its folds, almost hysterical. In the BG KATE comes rushing from the house to help her.
10. CONTINUED: smiles. She is flanked by the other two, in a litter of 0 paper-doll cutouts, and while they speak, HELEN'S hands thrust at their faces in turn, feeling baffledly at the movements of their lips. The CAMERA is on this; the dialogue is only background.
MARTHA: ( SNIPPING ) First Itm gonna cut off this doe- torts leg, one, two, now then
PERCY: Why you cuttin' off that doctor's I'm gonna give him a operation. Now I'm gonna cut off his arms, one, two. Now I'm gonna fix up She pushes HELEN'S hand away from her mouth. You stop that.
MARTHA: I'm gonna give him a operation. Now I'm gonna cut off his arms, one, two. Now I'm gonna fix up She pushes HELEN'S hand away from her mouth. You stop that.
PERCY: Cut off his stomach, that's a good operation.
MARTHA: No, I'm gonna cut off his head first, he got a bad cold.
PERCY: Ain't gonna be much of that doc- tor left to fix up, time you finish all them opera But HELEN is poking her fingers inside his mouth, to feel his tongue; he bites at them, annoyed, and she jerks them away. HELEN now fingers her own lips, moving them in imitation, but soundlessly. Again the CAMERA on this.
MARTHA: What you do, bite hand?
PERCY: That's how I do, she keep pokint. her fingers in my mouth, I just bite 'em off.

PEERCY: She tryint talk. She gonna get read. Looka her try in' talk.. ILLEN is scowling, the lips under her fingertips moving in silence, growing more and more frantic, until in a bizarre rage she bites at her own fingers. This sends PERCY off into laughter, but alarms :MARTHA.

KATE: Do you dare? Complain of what 0 you can see?
KELLER: ( Very annoyed ) This discussion is at an end] HELEN gropes her way with the doll back to AUNT EV. The house is at sixes and sevens from morning 'til night over the childl I want some peace here, I don't care how, but one way we won't have it is by rushing up and down the country every time someone hears of a new quack. I'm as sensible to this affliction as
AUNT EV: Helena My buttons.
14. CONTINUED: HELEN pushes the buttons into the doll's face. KATE 0 now sees, comes swiftly to kneel, lifts HELEN'S hand to her own eyes in question.
KATE: HELEN nods energetically. She wants the doll to have eyes. Another kind of silence now, while KATE takes pins and buttons from the sewing basket and attaches them to the doll as eyes. KELLER stands, caught, and watches morosely, AUNT EV blinks and conceals her emotion by inspecting her dress.
AUNT EV: My goodness me, I'm not decent.
KATE: She doesn't know better, Aunt Ev. I'll sew them on again.
AUNT EV: ( INDULGENTLY ) 40 It's worth a couple of buttons, Kate, look. HELEN now has the doll with eyes, and cannot contain herself for joy; she rocks the doll, pats it vigorously, kisses it. This child has more sense than all these men Kellers, if there's ever any way to reach that mind of hers.

KELLER: Katie, some way of teaching her an iota of discipline has to be
KATE: ( FLARING ) How can you discipline an afflicted child? Is it her fault? 0 HELEN'S fingers have fluttered to her Mother's lips, vainly trying to comprehend their movements; we are close on these two.
KELLER: I didn't say it was her fault.
KATE: Then whose? I don't know what to dot How can I teach her, beat her until she's black and blue?
KELLER: It's not safe to let her run around loose. Now there must be a way of confining her, somehow, so she can't-
KATE: Where, in a cage? She's a growing child, she has to use her limbs!
KELLER: Answer me one thing, is it fair to Mildred here?
15. CONTINUED: ( INEXORABLY ) Are you willing to put her away? Now HELEN'S face darkens in the same rage as at herself earlier, and her hand strikes at KATE'S lips. KATE catches her again, and HELEN begins to kick, struggle, Now what?

KELLER: Now what?
KATE: She wants to talk, like be like you and me. She holds HELEN struggling until we HEAR from the child her first sound so far, an inarticulate weird noise in her throat such as an animal in a trap might make; and KATE releases her. The second she is free, HELEN blunders away collides violently with a chair, falls, and sits weeping. KATE comes to her, embraces, caresses, soothes her, and buries her own face in her hair, until she can control her voice.
0 KATE: Every day she slips further away. I don't know how to call her back.
AUNT EV: Oh, I've a mind to write to Boston myself. If that School can't help her, maybe they'll know somebody who can.
KELLER: ( Presently, heavily ) I'll write to Perkins, Katie. He stands with the baby in his clasp, staring at HELEN'S head, hanging down on KATE'S arm.
