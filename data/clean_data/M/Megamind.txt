CREDITS SEQUENCE: NEWSPAPER HEADLINE MONTAGE: HEADLINES flash before us, displaying their accompanying "UBERMAN - METRO CITY'S HERO AFTER DEFEATING MASTER MIND! PHOTO: A chiseled, statuesque man wearing the COOLEST SUPER HERO SUIT IMAGINABLE, COMPLETE WITH FLOWING CAPE, shines a confident smile at the lens. This is UBERMAN, champion of
UBERMAN: You look so peaceful from up here.
EINSTEIN: I hate the outfits. I mean, I get it: we're all supposed to be "masterminds" - very clever.
PLATO: Theory of relativity.
EINSTEIN: Well, you'd think he'd invent a wool sweater that didn't itch so
MASTER MIND: The real Einstein once said, "God does not play dice with the world." He was right, because the world is MY dice. Is that understood?
EINSTEIN: ( gasping for air ) Yes, sir.
MASTER MIND: Alright, then - clean slate. Do we have the girl?
DA VINCI: Yes, sir. She fell into our trap just like you knew she would.
MASTER MIND: Reporters are a curious lot, and easily manipulated.
MASTER MIND: Alright, let's not keep the lady
MOMENTS LATER: Da Vinci escorts a BLINDFOLDED and bound woman, ROXANNE RITCHI, to the back of the room where Plato and Einstein are standing guard over a large BLACK SWIVEL-CHAIR facing away from us. She pulls free of Da Vinci's grasp and waits for him to undo the blindfold. Her face uncovered, we finally see Roxanne's striking features - all of which seem overshadowed by piercing eyes that seem more put off by the situation than afraid of it.
ROXANNE: You didn't need to turn around like that. I can recognize the stench of
MASTER MIND: I trust you gentlemen know the very sassy Roxanne Ritchi, highly regarded investigative journalist who some say has a more than friendly relationship with our super powered foe Uberman. And Miss Ritchi, I trust you've already met my new crew: The Mad Geniuses!
ROXANNE: Looks like a real group of winners. At the risk of sounding cliche', you'll never get away with this.
MASTER MIND: In a way, I already have.
ROXANNE: We go through this every time. You kidnap me to get to Uberman, he immediately finds your hideout, escapes whatever lame trap you've come up with, and takes you and your cronies to jail. I propose we just save everybody some heartache this time by YOU letting me go, and ME forgetting this whole thing ever What about my revenge?
MASTER MIND: What about my revenge?
ROXANNE: We can say it was wasting everyone's time.
MASTER MIND: You have a wicked tongue. I hope you rid yourself of that when you're my queen.
ROXANNE: I'm sorry. What makes you think I would want to be your queen?
MASTER MIND: Power corrupts absolutely, Miss Ritchi. And when I have ultimate power over this city, I have absolutely every intention of corrupting you with it.
PLATO: Master Mind turns to Plato who's now standing at a computer
MASTER MIND: ( annoyed ) What is it!?
UBERMAN: ( on monitor ) Master Mind!
UBERMAN: What's the matter, miss your old jail cell?
UBERMAN: You can't possibly believe this will work.
PLATO: We're now at minimum safe distance,
MASTER MIND: Excellent. Stop here, I like this Twenty seconds until impact.
PLATO: Twenty seconds until impact.
MASTER MIND: Any last words?
PLATO: Ten seconds to impact.
MASTER MIND: ( genuinely concerned ) What's going on?
UBERMAN: ( straining ) Hold.on.a second.
PLATO: Uberman loses his grip and FALLS BACKWARD ON HIS ASS.
UBERMAN: SON OF A BITCH!!
DA VINCI: What did he just say?
PLATO: Master Mind begins to laugh.
MASTER MIND: What kind of trick is this?
UBERMAN: Like you don't know. These bars are made of copper, aren't they?
PLATO: MASTER MIND
MASTER MIND: Yeah, so?
UBERMAN: You figured out my weakness, damn you. I CAN'T BEND COPPER!
PLATO: MASTER MIND
MASTER MIND: Your weakness is copper?
PLATO: Everyone turns to the window.
PLATO: I don't think even he could have survived that.
EINSTEIN: Whoa! Is it me or did you just finally destroy Uberman?
MASTER MIND: ( carefully skeptical ) Well.let's not get ahead of
DA VINCI: Look, there's something in the sky, coming this way.
ROXANNE: Master Mind turns toward the window. An object is in the air, flying directly toward them. As it closes in we can just make out the FAMILIAR OUTLINE OF A
MASTER MIND: I KNEW IT! PREPARE YOURSELVES! HE'S GONNA RAM US!!!
HOLY SHIT!: Roxanne breaks out of Da Vinci's hold and runs over to the She stares down at the still smoking corpse, the tattered black cape with the yellow "U" on it. Roxanne turns to Master Mind, who's still visibly dumbfounded at the grotesque sight before him.
ROXANNE: She stares down at the still smoking corpse, the tattered black cape with the yellow "U" on it. Roxanne turns to Master Mind, who's still visibly dumbfounded at the grotesque sight before him.
EINSTEIN: You did it!
MASTER MIND: .so I did.
EINSTEIN: I mean, I know you always wanted to. I mean, all the schemes all the plots - I never thought you'd actually be capable of it. This is history. Every villain and lackey in the history of villains and lackeys dream of this moment, but when does it actually EVER
EINSTEIN: This is history. Every villain and lackey in the history of villains and lackeys dream of this moment, but when does it actually EVER
EINSTEIN: Good lord.You do all realize what we get to do now, don't you?
EINSTEIN: We get to go on a crime wave.

MASTER MIND: ( absentmindedly ) Oh, right.
HAL: It's a sport of honor, focus and grace. Honor the ball, focus on the pins, release the ball not hard and fast, but as if you were releasing a baby dove.
HAL: Okay, do something like that - but center it more.
ATTRACTIVE BLOND: Tell me how my form looks, honey.
HAL: Oh, it's lookin' good. It's lookin' REAL good.
VINNIE: INT. KINGPIN BOWLING - VINNIE'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER Hal sits down, facing Vinnie who's sitting at his desk.
VINNIE: You're fired. Leave your shirt and locker key.
HAL: Fired? Are you going to tell me Showing up to work late. Showing up to work late drunk. Sexually harassing customers. Stealing from the register.
VINNIE: Showing up to work late. Showing up to work late drunk. Sexually harassing customers. Stealing from the register.
HAL: Vinnie, I don't know where you're getting these accusations -
HAL: Oh, which one do you supposedly have here?
VINNIE: This is all of them at once.
TELEVISION: A WOMAN walks up to a BOWLING EMPLOYEE and hands him a pair of shoes. As the employee turns to the wall of shoes, a very drunk and disheveled Hal comes running in and pushes him aside.
HAL: I've got this one, Benny. So, Cinderella. Can I help you find your glass slipper?
WOMAN: Yeah, I'm looking for a seven.
HAL: ( with a leer ) Seven - Well, maybe I could interest you in something in an EIGHT. Namely, me.
HAL: Suddenly realizing the register's open, he quickly grabs a stack of cash and shoves it in his pocket.
HAL: From the angle of the camera, I can see where you might have gotten the wrong idea. Listen, Vinnie, I don't think you've thought this through. If you fire me, who's gonna be captain of the alley's bowling Um, I don't know. Maybe somebody who can actually bowl. You guys have never won a game. I hired you because you said you were on the pro circuit.
VINNIE: Um, I don't know. Maybe somebody who can actually bowl. You guys have never won a game. I hired you because you said you were on the pro circuit.
HAL: No, I said I WILL BE on the pro Please, a loser like you will never amount to anything.
VINNIE: Please, a loser like you will never amount to anything.
HAL: Wow.If that's how you feel.I guess we should then talk about what kind of severance I'm gonna Hey.what about my ball?
HAL: Hey.what about my ball?

FRANK: ( cursing himself ) Oh, Jesus.
ROXANNE: It's okay. Come on into my office, sweetie.
FRANK: Come on into my office, sweetie.
FRANK: Can we get this woman some water for God's sake? I gave you two months off. What're you doing back? People are gonna think I'm a slave driver.
ROXANNE: Aren't you?
FRANK: Yeah, but I don't want people to think it.
ROXANNE: Frank, listen. I want to go back to work. I NEED to go back to work.
FRANK: .You're hysterical, aren't you?
ROXANNE: What're you doing?
FRANK: Keeping you warm before you go into
HERE?: A SECRETARY quickly enters with a bottled water. She sets it on the table in front of them and leaves. Roxanne pulls herself out of Frank's grasp and stands up to face him.
ROXANNE: It was a traumatic experience. Yes, everyone knows Uberman and me were.close. But what I really need - what would really make me better is getting back to work.
FRANK: Well, that's going to be.
ROXANNE: I thought you'd be happy to have me
FRANK: Oh, we are. Honey, nothing makes us happier than to have our girl back, Things have sorta.changed.
ROXANNE: Things have sorta.changed.
FRANK: Things have sorta.changed.

ROXANNE: ( disgusted ) Brad? Brad Helms? The man is an It's the suits. They think it's time to switch things up.
FRANK: It's the suits. They think it's time to switch things up.
ROXANNE: Oh, because they can't use me to get the big story.
FRANK: C'mon, Roxie. Using is in the nature of what we do. They used you, you used Uberman. Everybody's I didn't use him.
ROXANNE: ( defensive ) I didn't use him.
FRANK: Oh, I didn't mean that. I know you two were in love or something. My We were.
ROXANNE: We were.
FRANK: And that's great.
ROXANNE: Very in love.
ROXANNE: Okay. So, where are they going to move me if Brad has my spot?
FRANK: .Human interest.
ROXANNE: Bake sales and pet stories.
FRANK: I told them I wouldn't be surprised if you just upped and quit. You busted your ass for that desk. I'll take it.
ROXANNE: I'll take it.
FRANK: EXT. ABANDONED METRO CITY LIBRARY - NIGHT Amongst the jungle of high rises, one small building stands out from the rest - A tiny, forgotten piece of 19th century Gothic architecture. LIGHTENING FLASHES, revealing TWO CONCRETE GARGOYLES holding a cracked plaque, reading: METRO CITY LIBRARY.
EINSTEIN: Just robbed the diamond exchange.
MASTER MIND: ( feigning pleasure ) Great, great. Put it on the pile.
EINSTEIN: Anything else today?
MASTER MIND: Master Mind turns his attention back to the screen. Plato sees that Master Mind is in a funk and tries to snap him out of it.
PLATO: ( cheerfully ) Sir, the new reactor is installed.
PLATO: Do you want to throw the switch? I know how you love to start Maybe later. What is it, Plato?
MASTER MIND: Maybe later. What is it, Plato?
PLATO: ( nervously ) Sir, I can't help but notice that you've been.a little down lately.
MASTER MIND: When I want your opinion I'll beat it out of you.
PLATO: Yes, sir, I know, but please forgive my impertinence. It's just that you seem to have lost your lust for our profession. You've stopped going on jobs and spend most of your time watching Uberman I have defeated my greatest enemy. I have free reign over Metro City. I have more wealth than a thousand Sultans. I've achieved all I have worked for.so why am I so
MASTER MIND: I have defeated my greatest enemy. I have free reign over Metro City. I have more wealth than a thousand Sultans. I've achieved all I have worked for.so why am I so
MASTER MIND: I mean, my father, god rest his evil and tormented soul, raised me straight from the test tube to be a symbol of evil.
PLATO: .I sort of have a theory about all that.
MASTER MIND: ( snippy ) Oh, really?
PLATO: Well, for one thing, maybe Uberman was more important to you than you He was a worthy rival. Sometimes I wonder, did he consider me his evil equal or was I just an annoying, little gnat to him? .What's the second part?
MASTER MIND: He was a worthy rival. Sometimes I wonder, did he consider me his evil equal or was I just an annoying, little gnat to him? .What's the second part?
PLATO: I think you sort of have a thing for Roxanne Ritchi.
MASTER MIND: YOU WORM! HOW DARE YOU! WHERE WOULD YOU GET SUCH A NOTION? Sir, your plans always involve Ms. Ritchi either being kidnapped or placed in danger. If that's not love, I don't know what is. It's the grown up equivalent of dipping her pigtails in the ink well. Don't you see? She's the one treasure that's always escaped you.

FRIEND #1: I can't believe you came back so Are you sure it's not TOO SOON, I just wanted to get back to work.
FRIEND #2: Are you sure it's not TOO SOON, I just wanted to get back to work.
ROXANNE: I just wanted to get back to work.
FRIEND #3: What we need to do is get you back on the saddle.the love saddle.
FRIEND #3: It's been three weeks.
FRIEND #2: She just lost the love of her life,
ROXANNE: I keep trying to tell people it wasn't really like that. Uberman and I - We were kinda having problems. We broke up.
FRIEND #1: You broke up with Uberman!
FRIEND #3: You must have REALLY, REALLY high standards. I mean, you were dating a god. I mean, what's it take?
ROXANNE: Maybe someone who's a little more aware of his faults. Someone a little more sensitive.
FRIEND #3: Right. Someone who listens, sexy but attainable with cute little cheeks like a hamster and heartbreak in his eyes.
FRIEND #3: She wants John Cusack.
FRIEND #2: The actor?
FRIEND #3: No, the famous pediatrist - Yes, the actor. Ever since we were teenagers, Roxanne's totally had the hots for him.
ROXANNE: Well, until he miraculously comes walking into my life, I'm just going to take a little reflection time for myself.
MIND!: MASTER MIND
MASTER MIND: Who the hell is John Cusack?
POLITICIAN: The Fifth Avenue Renovation Project, which I championed, will breath new life into the downtown area. New life means new jobs and new revenue.
ROXANNE: Councilman, is it true that your brother-in-law's construction company won the contract for this Well.er.yes, but.look I'm not here to answer a lot of crazy
POLITICIAN: Well.er.yes, but.look I'm not here to answer a lot of crazy
YOUNG MOTHER: The young mother stops halfway down the block, reaches into the stroller and tries to comfort her now crying baby. Above her, a CRANE is maneuvering a pile of STEEL GIRDERS to an upper floor. Hal comes around the corner and heads in her direction.
CRANE: The crane GRINDS TO A HALT. The OPERATOR has a confused look on his face as he moves levers back and forth in an effort to fix the problem. Hal stops a few feet from the woman and stoops down to tie his shoe.
CRANE: The operator's hand slips off the lever, hitting a RED BUTTON. To his horror the crane DROPS ITS LOAD OF STEEL.
YOUNG MOTHER: Thank you! Thank you for saving me and my baby!
HAL: ( not knowing what she's
ROXANNE: What's it feel like to be a hero? Well.I'm just a man doing what men do. You're Roxanne Ritchi, aren't you?
HAL: Well.I'm just a man doing what men do. You're Roxanne Ritchi, aren't you?
REPORTER: Were you scared?
HAL: Scared? Who had time?
TELEVISION: John Cusack stands in the rain looking up at a window of a two story house. He holds up a BOOMBOX and "In Your Eyes" by Peter Gabriel begins to play. From the couch, Master Mind and his minions watch.
MASTER MIND: John Cusack, huh? So all I have to do is have a cute puppy dog stare, be willing to make a fool of myself and - Oh, REMOVE BOTH MY BALLS.
MASTER MIND: Please, get a hold of yourself.
ROXANNE: She goes to pick it up when someone bends down and picks it up for her. Looking up to thank him, Roxanne is suddenly stunned speechless - It's popular and critically acclaimed actor JOHN CUSACK, or rather Master Mind disguised as him.
"JOHN CUSACK": Oh the humanity - it was a Venti.
ROXANNE: ( stunned ) Yes, it's me. John Cusack.the
"JOHN CUSACK": Yes, it's me. John Cusack.the
"JOHN CUSACK": Hey, is that Shelly? Wait, I think remember something from that one - Let's see: "My head is screaming `I want you and need you' - my heart it keeps reaching to see you and feel you - yet in the end, I'm alone once again." Wow, I scare even myself. I'm sorry. I'm just really into poetry. Probably because I'm so sensitive and always going to great lengths to express myself. But enough about me. Can I fill you up?
ROXANNE: ( captivated ) ( catching herself ) I mean, excuse me?
"JOHN CUSACK": Can I fill you up? Your coffee.
ROXANNE: INT. BOOKSTORE CAFE' - LATER Roxanne talks as John Cusack listens to her every word She suddenly begins to feel the stares around her as passers- by being to notice who she's with.
ROXANNE: I did have a boyfriend - until fairly recently.
ROXANNE: I'm sorry - this is so surreal!
"JOHN CUSACK": Yeah, they charge way too much at these places - Now back to your boyfriend. I'm interested and compassionate. I want to know about Things were complicated. He was a man married to his work. There was.there was a lot of competition in his line of business. I'm sure you know what that's like.
ROXANNE: Things were complicated. He was a man married to his work. There was.there was a lot of competition in his line of business. I'm sure you know what that's like.
"JOHN CUSACK": Sure. In my business, one thing I have is RIVALS. For example, mine is.uh.Lou Ferr.igno.
ROXANNE: .The body-builder who used to play The Hulk on TV?
"JOHN CUSACK": Did he? Well, we're always up for the same roles. Did your boyfriend have someone like that? A particular rival that was always getting his goat - so to speak?
ROXANNE: Well.one rival in particular seemed to get more of his attention than I ever did. But enough about my problems.
"JOHN CUSACK": NO, TELL ME MORE!!! I'm sorry. I got a whooping cough. Had it ever since Serendipity. I
ROXANNE: Right, well, he seemed to need him more than he needed me.
"JOHN CUSACK": How do you mean?
ROXANNE: It was conflict he thrived on. He always said he wouldn't know what to do with himself if Master - I mean, this guy were gone. It was like he needed it, like oxygen.
"JOHN CUSACK": ( almost to himself ) I think I finally understand.The only logical answer is to recreate that rivalry - or if that's impossible, create one of equal structure. That's it!
ROXANNE: John Cusack snaps out of his dream-like haze realizing she's heard every word.
"JOHN CUSACK": Oh, sorry, sorry. Just rehearsing for a part.where I play a man who talks to himself at inappropriate
"JOHN CUSACK": I have to go right now, but I'd really like to see you again - if that's alright.
ROXANNE: I'd love that.
EINSTEIN: Got her nose!
MASTER MIND: I've got it!
MASTER MIND: I've got it!
MASTER MIND: It's plain and simple. Extraordinary minds need extraordinary stimulation. Without that stimulus they wither and die. Therefore, there is only one logical conclusion: I must create a new superhero.
EINSTEIN: Yeah, maybe that's not such hot Prepare for Operation Superhero
MASTER MIND: ( ignoring him ) Prepare for Operation Superhero
MASTER MIND: Prepare the subject. Plato, pour the toxic waste.
SEVERS: I feel fine. Just a little sticky, but aside from that everything's completely -
MASTER MIND: Okay then.
MASTER MIND: And this one?
PLATO: We attached gills to him. He can breath under water.
MASTER MIND: Ah. Does he have extraordinary Can he fly?
PLATO: MASTER MIND
MASTER MIND: Can he fly?
PLATO: MASTER MIND
MASTER MIND: Resilient to weapons fire?
PLATO: MASTER MIND
MASTER MIND: He just breathes under water, then.
PLATO: Master Mind rolls his eyes and walks away.
MASTER MIND: Plato, the radioactive spider,
STENWICK: He brushes the spider off.
MASTER MIND: Anything, Stenwick?
STENWICK: ( shaken ) No. Ah.sir, I didn't know this was about spiders. I have a pretty severe case of arachnophobia.
MASTER MIND: We're gonna need more venom.
MASTER MIND: This has proven to be a challenge. I just don't know what I want. What do I want?
EINSTEIN: Yeah, well, it sounds like what you want is Uberman.
MASTER MIND: That's it! Why make a copy when the real thing will do?
EINSTEIN: I was just kidding, sir. In case you forgot, you actually burned Uberman alive.
MASTER MIND: Then we'll make a new one. Plato, bring me the box!
MINUTES LATER: Master Mind and the lackeys stand in a circle around a small Plato places a STAINLESS STEEL CHEST in the tables center. As Master Mind opens it, he's immediately doused in WHITE GLOW emanating from inside.
MASTER MIND: Behold - Uberessence. The very thing that gave Uberman his superhuman powers.
EINSTEIN: Where the hell did you get that?
MASTER MIND: Oh, I shot him with a power sucking gun and had this idea to use this to clone a whole army of evil Ubermen. I'm not sure why I never got around to following up with I believe he defeated you before you could, master.
PLATO: I believe he defeated you before you could, master.
MASTER MIND: .Right. Man, he was good!
DA VINCI: You want another volunteer, sir?
MASTER MIND: Not another volunteer driven by the need for personal gain. Somebody else, somebody pure.
NEWS REPORTER: .who risked his own life to save that of a young mother and her Please, please, you're embarrassing me. I saw someone in need and I helped them. What more can we ask of ourselves. I ask you, what more?
HAL: Please, please, you're embarrassing me. I saw someone in need and I helped them. What more can we ask of ourselves. I ask you, what more?
PLATO: Yeah, sir. This guy is a real piece of work. He used to teach bowling at Kingpin's.
MASTER MIND: ( into phone ) A modest profession to brilliantly hide his true heroic nature. I love Then you are absolutely going to love this -
PLATO: Then you are absolutely going to love this -
PLATO: - He volunteers at a school for the
MASTER MIND: He volunteers. He doesn't ask for any reward for his deeds. The fates are shining down on me. This Mr. Stewart is truly an unselfish soul.
HAL: You greedy little bastard. I already gave you a twenty.
BLIND KID: Hey, you want me to play along? Then pay up, bitch!
HAL: Fine, but you better be convincing.
HAL: Here she comes, go to work.
BLIND KID: ( weeping ) Why can't I see! Why God?
HAL: Hey, Peter. C'mon champ, let me look at you.
HAL: You know, in life we're all given no more than we can bear. This happened to you maybe because you were meant to rise above it - Maybe to be an inspiration to the other little Peteys out there.
BLIND KID: You really think so, Hal?
HAL: Hey, does it LOOK like I'm lying? Now c'mon, go feel your way to class before you get your little butt suspended.
HAL: Petey, wait a minute.
HAL: Don't run into anything!
PLATO: I think I've seen enough, sir. This is your guy.
HAL: ( obviously playing it up Oh, there it is again. This is really getting embarrassing now.
HAL: ( to Attractive Woman ) Oh, crap. You got me.
TRUCKER#1: Let me tell you something. That was just about the bravest damn thing I've ever witnessed. ( he turns to the rest of the bar ) Hey, everybody! This guy's the hero from
TV!: The bar ERUPTS IN CHEERS.
MOMENTS LATER: Hal is riding on the shoulders of TRUCKER#2 and TRUCKER#3 as `I'm Holding Out For A Hero' plays on the jukebox. TRUCKER#1 suddenly puts his hands in the air. The room quickly goes silent.
TRUCKER#1: I want to give you something.
ATTRACTIVE WOMAN: Hey, you're on TV again.
BRAD HELMS: This just in. Upon a second look at that tape from this morning, which we'll now replay for you, it appears it was not the heroic act it first seemed to be.
HAL: I guess that looks kinda bad.
DA VINCI: There he is, boss.
MASTER MIND: Now, we're sure this won't kill Yes, sir. He'll just feel a slight electrical shock.
PLATO: Yes, sir. He'll just feel a slight electrical shock.
MASTER MIND: Master Mind raises the rifle and aims it at Hal.
MASTER MIND: Slight electrical shock?
HAL: God, I hate the weather in this
MASTER MIND: Follow him.
CAT: You don't look so good, man.
HAL: I don't feel good. I was struck by freaking lightening.
CAT: No, you're just hallucinating. By the way, we're out of orange juice.
HAL: Hal jumps up, trips over a cardboard box and knocks himself out on the coffee table.
AAAAAAHHHHH!: Hal jumps up, trips over a cardboard box and knocks himself out on the coffee table.
HAL: Shaking his head, he walks to the kitchen and opens the He pulls out an orange juice container and puts it to his mouth. It's empty. As if suddenly remembering something he looks from the carton to the cat, who is busy cleaning himself. He shakes the thought from his mind.
BATHROOM: Hal lifts the seat and unbuckles his pants.
HAL'S FACE: He stares at the ceiling with half closed eyes. The inevitable sound of urine hitting water starts. A content look washes over his face. There is a distinct sound of porcelain CRACKING and
HAL: He starts running after it.
HONK!: Hal spins around to see a car barreling toward him. He goes to jump out of the way - ZOOM - he FLIES TWO STORIES UP, nails a building and comes crashing back down to the Hal sits up, disheveled and scared.
MASTER MIND: Welcome to your second birth, Hal
"PAT MORITA": INT. HAL'S APARTMENT - DAY Hal enters, grabs a bottle of vodka from atop of the fridge and takes a long pull from it.
HAL: Who are you!?
VOICE: I am the guide on your journey. Fate has chosen you to be it's
LATER: We are close on Hal's face as his eyes flutter open. He appears to be lying on the couch. He hunches up on his elbows, looks around, but everything is as it seems. He lays his head back down.
HAL: Thank God. It was a dream. Man, I must be losing it.
HAL: Jesus! This isn't happening, this isn't happening.
"PAT MORITA": Calm. All things must be filtered through calmness.
HAL: Bullshit! Sometimes it's best to freak out.
"PAT MORITA": I think we must work on your attitude first.
HAL: Look I'm gonna call the cops in about two seconds if you don't get out of here.
"PAT MORITA": Are you calm now?
HAL: Yeah, I'm okay.
"PAT MORITA": Good, because we've got a lot of work to do.
HAL: What the hell was that for?
"PAT MORITA": Rule number one: expect the Can you just tell me what this is all about?
HAL: Can you just tell me what this is all about?
"PAT MORITA": The heavens are not in the habit of bestowing a gift such as this to just anyone. You are being rewarded for being a man of great moral fortitude with an unwavering belief in humanity.
HAL: That's me alright.
"PAT MORITA": I am to train you so you may fulfill your destiny to defeat the great menace to Metro City: Master
HAL: We're are we going?
"PAT MORITA": To train.
"PAT MORITA": Strength is just as much in the mind as it is the muscle. Remember, both need to be exercised.
HAL: I'M LIFTING A FREAKING CAR!!!

HAL: God, I feel so gay.
"PAT MORITA": ( in Master Mind voice ) What is it?
HAL: YEEEE HAWWWW!
YEEEE HAWWWW!: Pat turns his attention back to the phone, talking in his John Cusack voice.

HAL: WHOOOOA! Man, that is so cool. It's like fly - Oh my God, I almost said it was like flying.
"PAT MORITA": For the rest of the day I want you to continue to practice your flying Why, where're ya going?
HAL: Why, where're ya going?
"PAT MORITA": .To do something.mysterious .and Asian.
HAL: Say no more, bro. I'll just keep at it, then.
ROXANNE: How's your sandwich?
"JOHN CUSACK": It's quite delicious.
ROXANNE: Hope you don't think I'm too forward. Some men are intimidated when a woman asks them out. I just find you really easy to talk to.
"JOHN CUSACK": And I you.
ROXANNE: You know, you're not at all like you are in the movies.
"JOHN CUSACK": I'm not?
ROXANNE: Yeah. I don't know - You have this strange, refined way of speaking.
"JOHN CUSACK": I do? That is most interesting.
ROXANNE: Anyway, when we were talking the other day I just felt, even though we only talked for a couple of hours, that we've known each other for years.
"JOHN CUSACK": I know just what you mean.
ROXANNE: You know what? This sandwich is
"JOHN CUSACK": It means you don't give up on a sandwich. You see that it has potential, and you give it every chance to be all it can be.
ROXANNE: Thanks, but knowing me, I was probably projecting my expectations of what a lunch should be on the sandwich. It might have been okay at first, but I just made it
"JOHN CUSACK": Is that what happened with your last sandwich - I mean, boyfriend?
ROXANNE: When I look back, I probably shouldn't of expected so much from him. He was already a giving person. You know, one of those go out and save the world types.
"JOHN CUSACK": I've run into a few.
ROXANNE: I was selfish, I guess. I didn't want to share him with anybody It sounds like he was a special They broke the mold.
"JOHN CUSACK": It sounds like he was a special They broke the mold.
ROXANNE: They broke the mold.
"JOHN CUSACK": Perhaps not.
TITAN: What's the "T" stand for?
"PAT MORITA": What's that supposed to mean?
TITAN: What's that supposed to mean?
"PAT MORITA": It's from Roman mythology. Zeus's father.oh, just go with it. You look perfect.
TITAN: I don't think this mask is big enough. Are you sure no one is gonna recognize me?
"PAT MORITA": It's fine, just don't slouch. It's all in the posture.
JOHN: Alright folks, this is a robbery. Nobody moves - yadda, yadda,
GEORGE: The safe. Let's go.
BANK MANAGER: Okay, just don't hurt anyone.
GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
TITAN: Well, boys, there's no need for all this just to get the free toaster.
PAUL: What are you suppose to be?
TITAN: Well, justice, suck on this. Now it's my turn.
GEORGE: Well, justice, suck on this. Now it's my turn.
TITAN: Now it's my turn.
HAL: Well, Ringo.um.um.you're under arrest.
BANK MANAGER: ( to Hal ) On behalf of the First National Bank of Metro City, I'd like to offer you a reward for your act of
TITAN: ( reading ) Ten thousand dollars!
BRAD HELMS: This story's mine.
ROXANNE: Listen, Brad. We were just in the area. I was just trying to -
BRAD HELMS: I've been in this business long enough to know pretty well what you were "just trying to do." Besides, I heard you couldn't take the big game anymore and were put on fluff
SETH: You're not gonna take that from him, are you?
ROXANNE: He's right. Old habit, I guess. We'll get out of your way.
BRAD HELMS: Besides, I'm sure there's a pancake supper somewhere that needs
ON TELEVISION: We see the news conference on the bank's steps. In the corner of the screen is written: "recorded earlier."
BRAD HELMS: For months now, since the death of Uberman, the citizens of Metro City have been holding out for a hero. Well, it appears they won't have to hold out for much longer as a new costumed crusader has suddenly stormed onto the scene. Today, at the Metro Savings and Trust, a masked mystery man single-handedly defeated "The Fab Four Gang." Just who is this new caped avenger?
BRAD HELMS: I'm sure all of our viewers are now wondering, what's the "T" stand It's a message to all the scum out there. Uberman may be gone, but Metro City has a new protector, and his name is "Tighten!"
TITAN: It's a message to all the scum out there. Uberman may be gone, but Metro City has a new protector, and his name is "Tighten!"
REPORTER: How do you spell that?
MASTER MIND: ( reading paper ) Oh, for heaven's sake. I can't believe it. He misspelled his name.
EINSTEIN: ( whispering ) Yeah, if the plan is getting us in
MASTER MIND: You know, Einstein, maybe I should have called you Socrates. He also didn't know when to keep his thoughts to himself.
EINSTEIN: I just fail to see the point in all of this. I mean, why are we creating another superhero when it was such a pain in the ass for you to get rid of the other one? I mean, Uberman is destroyed, we should be using this opportunity To what?
MASTER MIND: To what?
EINSTEIN: I don't know. To take over the weather, space, the world - whatever super villains are SUPPOSED to do.
MASTER MIND: The reason someone like you will always be a minion is because you have no foresight. We take over the earth, like you said. Then what? Women? Cars? Money? Even the grandest treasures will lose their lustre if you don't have someone to hold them over.
EINSTEIN: That's it! This balance of the force bullshit is getting way too Oprah for me. I'm blowing. Who's with me?
MASTER MIND: You dare?
EINSTEIN: Yeah, I dare. I'm sick of wearing stupid costumes, and I'm sick of working for a super villain who's turning into a softie.
MASTER MIND: What - did - you - call me?
EINSTEIN: You heard me. You used to be an inhuman monster, now look at you. You're creating super heroes, you don't go with us on robberies anymore, it's been days since you threatened anyone, oh, and not to mention this Roxanne Ritchi thing.
MASTER MIND: THAT is none of your business, Hey, you guys haven't sealed the deal yet, have you?
EINSTEIN: Hey, you guys haven't sealed the deal yet, have you?
MASTER MIND: ( In a woman's voice ) Oh, Master, your head is so big.
EINSTEIN: ( In a woman's voice ) Oh, Master, your head is so big.
MASTER MIND: I'm warning you, Einstein.
EINSTEIN: ( In a woman's voice ) Take me!
MASTER MIND: I said silence! Get out of my sight.
ROXANNE: Don't get me wrong, I love being a reporter. I don't think I could do anything else. It's the consequences of what we do that I'm having a problem with.
"JOHN CUSACK": That's where journalistic responsibility comes in, no?
ROXANNE: It's supposed to.
"JOHN CUSACK": Sounds to me like you're running from something.
ROXANNE: I got someone I cared about killed. If it wasn't for me, he wouldn't have been involved.
"JOHN CUSACK": You can't blame yourself. My father used to say each of us must answer the great call to truly feel alive.
ROXANNE: Was he an actor?
"JOHN CUSACK": .No. He was.a landscaper. And a horrible one. I mean he would fail time and time again at his.landscaping. And sometimes he'd get pretty beaten up or thrown in jail -
ROXANNE: "JOHN CUSACK"
"JOHN CUSACK": My point is he took the good with the bad. He grew a little each time. Improved, learned.
ROXANNE: Was he ever successful?
"JOHN CUSACK": God, no.but don't let deter you.
ROXANNE: Thanks for this. You know, this is embarrassing, but it's been a long time since I -
"JOHN CUSACK": What were you gonna say?
ROXANNE: Oh, I was gonna say.It's been a long time since.well, I've been with someone I.enjoy being with.
"JOHN CUSACK": To people who enjoy being with each
"JOHN CUSACK": Okay, never mind that. Now, where were we?
ROXANNE: Oh my God.
MASTER MIND: You're not gonna get all freaky about this, are you?
ROXANNE: This.this is too much, even for you. God, I go out with you, tell you my innermost thoughts.
MASTER MIND: I only did this because I wanted to talk to you on the same level. You know, without all the baggage?
ROXANNE: Baggage? You burned my boyfriend alive, you sick son-of-a-bitch!
MASTER MIND: You see, that's exactly what I'm talking about.
ROXANNE: Stay away from me.
MASTER MIND: INT. MASTER MIND'S BEDROOM - NIGHT Master Mind is lying on his back, wide awake.
MASTER MIND: ( mumbling to himself ) Stupid. What was I thinking? Plato, it's his fault. He's the one who sent me on this weak-willed path. I'll filet his scrotum for this. Me, a creature of evil, in love with Roxanne Ritchi. Preposterous. I hardly give such matters thought
MASTER MIND: I should just go up there and just lay it all out to her. "Roxanne, I like you - I always have. Oh, and I'm sorry I blew up your ex. ( realizing the absurdity of his words ) Yeah, that would go over like a pants-less clown at a child's birthday party. What the hell am I even doing here? Who cares what she thinks? I'm a supervillain and here I am acting like a love struck schoolboy. Forget this. I control my own
ROXANNE: She grabs her long coat and throws it over her robe.
ROXANNE: Please be open.
ROXANNE: A pack of Lady Strikes, please.
MASTER MIND: Hello, Triple A?
MASTER MIND: I'll call you back.
SHOPKEEPER: SHOTGUN HOODLUM SHOTGUN HOODLUM ( CONT'D )
SHOTGUN HOODLUM: Shut up, Gramps. Gimme that necklace!
ROXANNE: I don't think so.
SHOTGUN HOODLUM: I said give it to me!
SHOTGUN HOODLUM: What the hell's that? A super No, it's a goo gun.
MASTER MIND: No, it's a goo gun.
SHOTGUN HOODLUM: Yeah, what's it do?
MASTER MIND: It goos.
SHOPKEEPER: I know you! You Master Brain guy. You a hero.
MASTER MIND: Don't - EVER - say that again.
ROXANNE: Master Mind turns around.
MASTER MIND: Don't flatter yourself.
ROXANNE: Don't walk away from me when I'm talking to you.
MASTER MIND: My, someone has a rather high opinion of themselves. Do you really think I would be with someone like you?
ROXANNE: ( coldly ) Do you really think I would be with someone like you?
MASTER MIND: With that, Master Mind exits into the night, leaving Roxanne with a baffled expression on her face.
PLATO: Everything alright, sir?
MASTER MIND: ( overly calm ) Fine, why do you ask?
PLATO: Master Mind tightens his grip.
MASTER MIND: Go on.
PLATO: Master Mind releases him.
MASTER MIND: Just with business, my minion. Just with business. I've decided it is You mean?
PLATO: You mean?
MASTER MIND: Yes, we've created our hero, now it's time to give him a little How do we do that?
DA VINCI: How do we do that?
MASTER MIND: To be simply good is not enough. A hero must be driven by an almost relentless desire to right a wrong that can never be corrected.
PLATO: You mean?
MASTER MIND: Yes, he must lose someone near and dear to him - his father figure. Gentlemen, it's time for Operation Mentor Kill!
MOMENTS LATER: Titan looks down to see an APARTMENT BUILDING IN RUIN. Emergency lights flash around it as swarms of people run around in chaos.
TITAN: Man, what the hell happened down there? Wait a sec -
TITAN: From the wreckage crawls a dying Pat Morita.
PAT!: Titan goes and kneels beside Pat, holding him in his arms.
"PAT MORITA": I'm dying, kid. There is just one last lesson I have for you. It is the most important of all.
TITAN: What's that?
"PAT MORITA": Master Mind did this, you must avenge me.
TITAN: Master Mind? Why?
"PAT MORITA": Because he's evil. You must stop the evil Hal - stop the.
REPORTER 1: Tighten, Is this the work of Master How will the death of your mentor affect your resolve?
REPORTER 2: How will the death of your mentor affect your resolve?
REPORTER 3: Was that Pat Morita?
TITAN: This injustice will not go unpunished. Master Mind, if you can hear me, Tighten is coming for you.
MASTER MIND: Alright, people, we don't have much time. Titan should be here any minute, so let's get the lead out.
DA VINCI: Nearly up to full power, sir.
MASTER MIND: Hum. Let's turn it down a few notches. It's his first time and we don't want to get in a lucky shot, now do we?
PLATO: Not yet, sir.
MASTER MIND: I see. Well, he must be planning something big. Are the flame androids deployed?
PLATO: All twelve.
MASTER MIND: Wonderful, wonderful. Plato, Da Vinci, take your places next to me.
LATER: Apparently quite some time has passed. The bold stances have degraded to fatigue.
PLATO: He's certainly taking his time.
MASTER MIND: He'll be here. That's the way it
STILL LATER: Master Mind reclines in his chair and taps his metal gauntlet impatiently on the armrest. Plato has squatted down, resting his chin on his hand.
TITAN: Oh, for crying out loud.
MASTER MIND: Do you know who I am?
TITAN: Yeah, you're Master Mind. Yeah! You're actually the guy I want to Oh, so NOW you want to get down to it. Well, I want to get a few things off my chest first. Of all the inconsiderate - Do you have any idea how long we waited for you? We're you even planning on coming to me and getting revenge? Well, at first I was going to. You know, because that's what I figured I was supposed to do. But then I got to thinking-
MASTER MIND: Oh, so NOW you want to get down to it. Well, I want to get a few things off my chest first. Of all the inconsiderate - Do you have any idea how long we waited for you? We're you even planning on coming to me and getting revenge? Well, at first I was going to. You know, because that's what I figured I was supposed to do. But then I got to thinking-
TITAN: Well, at first I was going to. You know, because that's what I figured I was supposed to do. But then I got to thinking-
MASTER MIND: ( interrupting ) -You got to thinking? There's nothing to think about. I'm the villain. I do something bad, you come and get me.
TITAN: - I got to thinking.what's the
MASTER MIND: Maybe you're right. What's the
TITAN: That's what I wanted to talk to you Where did you get all this?
MASTER MIND: ( baffled ) Where did you get all this?
TITAN: ( proudly ) Get this: I stole them.
MASTER MIND: From where?
TITAN: From all over. You see, once you killed Pat and ruined my other apartment building I was pretty pissed off, so I figured I'd go, find you and kick some ass. Then I thought to myself: "Okay,then what?" I mean, if we were to fight, what would I get out of it? Would I get my apartment back? Would I be able to pay the bills?
MASTER MIND: Well, what about your mentor?
TITAN: Tell you the truth? He was kind of a dick. I mean, being a hero is dandy and all, but it's volunteer work. Now you've always had the right take on all this. I mean, when you rob a bank or take over the diamond exchange you get something out of it. I mean, when you don't get caught, which, no offense, isn't very often. And that brings me to what I wanted to propose to you: Who could catch you if I'm by your side? You want to team-up?
MASTER MIND: You want to team-up?
TITAN: You got the brains, I got the brawn. We could even call ourselves that: `Brain' and `Brawn'. Look at
MASTER MIND: What do I think?
TITAN: I worked hard on this.
MASTER MIND: Oh - gee - I am so sorry!
TITAN: Now, hold on. You're going a little too far.
MASTER MIND: I wish your mother said that to your father the night of your conception, they would have saved me a whole lot of heartache.
TITAN: Hey, I mean it.
MASTER MIND: Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do?
DA VINCI: MASTER MIND ( O.S. )
DA VINCI: What hurts?
MASTER MIND: The overly large henchmen starts to pull his master from the dumpster when they suddenly hear a voice from above. It's Titan peeking through the hole in his apartment wall.
TITAN: I don't need you, I don't need anybody. I have the power to do and take anything I want. And now, I'm gonna take back everything this city owes me. Beware Metro City, it's time for Titan to collect.
DA VINCI: How'd the plan go, boss?
MASTER MIND: I just made myself redundant, old
DA VINCI: It's not that bad.
SECURITY GUARD: Morning, Tighten.
TITAN: SECURITY GUARD Oh, don't bother about me. I'm just here to make a withdrawal.
SECURITY GUARD: Is there something we can do for
TITAN: Oh, don't bother about me. I'm just here to make a withdrawal.
BANK MANAGER: Say, did he just rob us?
SECURITY GUARD: Not sure. Sort of looks it, don't Should I, you know, stop him?
BANK MANAGER: SECURITY GUARD
SECURITY GUARD: Should I, you know, stop him?
BANK MANAGER: As the security guard exits the bank, the manager stares out the window. His eyes suddenly grow wide with terror. The guard's body suddenly smashes through the window, landing at the startled bank manager's feet.
TELEVISION: "A Channel 7 News Special Report." Brad Helms wipes into
BRAD HELMS: "Absolute power corrupts absolutely." When Lord Acton stated that, in a letter to Bishop Mandell Creighton in 1887, no one thought much about it, but today Metro City is reeling from that very prophecy. Tighten, who many thought of as our savior, has turned his back on the cause of justice.
PLATO: I don't understand it. He seemed to have every characteristic we were looking for in a superhero.
MASTER MIND: Well, there's no use crying about it now, we must take action. I'm not going to play second fiddle to that crass buffoon. We must destroy It won't be easy. Uberman had a sense of decency and genuine love for the people. That was his weakness and was easily used against him.
PLATO: It won't be easy. Uberman had a sense of decency and genuine love for the people. That was his weakness and was easily used against him.
MASTER MIND: Yes, but he possesses the same flaws present in Uberman's DNA - copper. It's like Benjamin Franklin always said: "If something works don't dick with it."
TITAN: I can have anything I want. I'm like a god.
TITAN: Point to any woman in this bar. I could have her in a second.
TITAN: ( to Old Barfly ) Hey, you wanna get with this?
BARTENDER: Buddy, what do you want?
TITAN: What do you want? That's the question, isn't it. I mean, what do you want when you can have I suppose what I really want is to never be forgotten again. I want to do something that can never be cast aside or one-upped. I want a - what's it called? - A legacy. I want a legacy. Yeah, that's it. I like the sound that.
BARTENDER: I meant, what do you want to drink?
TITAN: EXT. BAR - LATER Titan stumbles out of the bar, carrying a large sack of He looks up to see Master Mind suddenly standing before him.
TITAN: MASTER MIND
MASTER MIND: There can be only one master criminal in this city - and it's
TITAN: Titan melodramatically throws up his arms.
MASTER MIND: I have a better idea - NOW!
TITAN: You know what? You're nothing but a bug. Not even worth my effort.
MASTER MIND: He's not as dumb as I thought.
PLATO: I guess not.Funny, though.
MASTER MIND: What's funny?
PLATO: Funny Uberman didn't think of the same thing.
HAL: That's it!
HAL: Hello, Legacy.
VINNIE: Hey, that's my ball!
ELDERLY WOMAN: That was a close one. Sixth floor,
MASTER MIND: Wow, I always thought Uberman was your first superhero - but it looks like our little Roxanne dated a linebacker in college.
ROXANNE: That's my diary.
MASTER MIND: So it is.
ROXANNE: It's personal.
MASTER MIND: Well, then I wouldn't leave it in your underwear drawer for just anyone to find.
ROXANNE: What do you want?
MASTER MIND: I need your help.
ROXANNE: So you knock me out and tie me to a You're not going to like what I'm about to tell you.
MASTER MIND: You're not going to like what I'm about to tell you.
ON TELEVISION: Brad Helms is huddled behind a van.
BRAD HELMS: It's chaos here in city square as city police -
ROXANNE: He's really out of control.
MASTER MIND: Tell me about it.
ROXANNE: I should have known. You have something to do with this, don't you? - With Titan turning evil.
MASTER MIND: Well, the evil thing he did by himself. My goal was to give MYSELF purpose by creating an intellectual sparring partner.
ROXANNE: ( confused ) You're talking like you made him.
MASTER MIND: And they call me Master Mind.
ROXANNE: Let me get this straight. You missed getting your ass kicked, so you made a new guy to kick your ass. That's pathetic.
MASTER MIND: In hindsight. And his powers, they're just like Uberman's. Why would he have his I had some left over from something. I infused him with it.
ROXANNE: And his powers, they're just like Uberman's. Why would he have his I had some left over from something. I infused him with it.
MASTER MIND: ( almost ashamed ) I had some left over from something. I infused him with it.
ROXANNE: YOU DID WHAT!? Yeah, that's why I decided to tie you up.
MASTER MIND: Yeah, that's why I decided to tie you up.
ROXANNE: You did all this because you wanted He seemed nice.
MASTER MIND: He seemed nice.
TELEVISION: Titan is standing on top of a destroyed police car. He waves for the camera to zoom in on him.
TITAN: Closer. I want to show the people my real face.
ROXANNE: Hal Stewart. He's the guy we thought saved that woman and kid. Turned out he was just trying to save his own ass.
MASTER MIND: Yeah, good to know - NOW!
TELEVISION: Titan throws the mask over this shoulder and hops off the
TITAN: That's right, I'm really Hal Stewart. Former hero and bowling teacher at Kingpin's Bowling.
ROXANNE: You picked a bowler to give super powers to?
MASTER MIND: It's a modest profession!
TELEVISION: With my new found power, I've recently started to wonder what sort of legacy I should leave. Should I be a hero? I tried that once before - even saved a lady and her baby from being squashed. I was treated like a god until everyone started to shit on me - Okay, so what if I didn't "purposely" save
TITAN: With my new found power, I've recently started to wonder what sort of legacy I should leave. Should I be a hero? I tried that once before - even saved a lady and her baby from being squashed. I was treated like a god until everyone started to shit on me - Okay, so what if I didn't "purposely" save
TITAN: Well, I'm going to make something that can't be taken away from me. I'm going to create a permanent monument to my greatness. One that won't be so easily forgotten or
TITAN: I intend to create a new category in the Guinness Book of World's Records by rolling the biggest strike in the history of bowling.
TITAN: My thanks to the city planning commission. This wouldn't have been possible without them.
TITAN: Tell your friends and family to tune in right here to this station at noon tomorrow.
ROXANNE: My god, he's nuts. That'll destroy the whole business triangle.
ROXANNE: MASTER MIND
MASTER MIND: My lair is in the direct path of the ball.
ROXANNE: Oh, real nice. Wouldn't want anything to happen to your hideout, would we?
MASTER MIND: You don't understand. I have certain equipment that's - that's highly unstable.
ROXANNE: What do you mean?
MASTER MIND: I sort of have a hydrogen reactor, A HYDROGEN reactor?
ROXANNE: A HYDROGEN reactor?
MASTER MIND: It's experimental - only one in the world.Well, how do you think I power all my inventions? Someone like me can't pay for electricity. The bills would be outrageous.
ROXANNE: A REACTOR? It creates 100 times the output of a nuclear one.If destroyed it - Vaporize the entire city!
A REACTOR?: MASTER MIND
MASTER MIND: It creates 100 times the output of a nuclear one.If destroyed it - Vaporize the entire city!
ROXANNE: - Vaporize the entire city!
MASTER MIND: ( proudly ) Pshaw.the whole eastern seaboard, actually. That little baby is amazing. I'm quite proud of it.
MASTER MIND: Did Uberman have a hideout?
ROXANNE: MASTER MIND
MASTER MIND: A cave, a solitary fortress of some kind. C'mon, all heros have a place to hang their capes up in. Roxanne, it may be our only chance to find something, a clue, anything that could give us a fighting chance.
ROXANNE: It's under his house.
MASTER MIND: Whose house?
ROXANNE: Wayne Scott's.
MASTER MIND: Wayne Scott? Uberman was Wayne Scott!? Wayne Scott, the wealthy philanthropist? But he disappeared -
ROXANNE: ( interrupting ) He disappeared just over two months ago when you killed him. Not only did you rid the world of a hero, you killed a kind, noble, generous Looks like you got what you always wanted. Uberman is out of the picture and Metro City is doomed.
MASTER MIND: "Metro City doomed." You know, I never thought I'd say something like this, but here it goes -
MASTER MIND: Such a dark place for one such as you. I wonder, underneath your noble deeds, what inner demons drove you to your endless crusade for justice?
MASTER MIND: Good lord, man. You've only been dead for two months.
SCREEN: A woman dressed in a leather DOMINATRIX OUTFIT is whipping an overweight man lying on a swing-like device with his butt sticking out.
PINEAPPLE!!! PINEAPPLE!!!: Master Mind's eyes are transfixed on the disturbing imagery. The door by the pinball machine suddenly swings open. WAYNE SCOTT, dressed in raggedy sweats, steps into the room carrying a CAN OF BEER and a bowl of JIFFY-POP. Master Mind cannot believe his horrified eyes.
MASTER MIND: Wayne Scott is just as startled.
WAYNE SCOTT: He drop his drink and snack to the floor. The two men stare at each other as they struggle to regain their normal breathing patterns. Wayne Scott walks over to the couch, brushes off a thick layer of chip crumbs, and sits down.
MASTER MIND: I might just ask you the same question. I had thought I incinerated you.
WAYNE SCOTT: You scared the bejesus out of me. How'd you figure out I was still alive? Wait, how do you know my Roxanne told me. As for your ruse, I forgot to line the bottom of the copper cage - Somebody pointed that out to me recently. Figured if they could do it, so could you. But one thing I couldn't figure out -
MASTER MIND: Roxanne told me. As for your ruse, I forgot to line the bottom of the copper cage - Somebody pointed that out to me recently. Figured if they could do it, so could you. But one thing I couldn't figure out -
WAYNE SCOTT: The skeleton? Something I "borrowed" from a medical school a few months before.
MASTER MIND: A few months? How long had you been planning this?
WAYNE SCOTT: I always planned to retire - eventually. I mean, come on, you can't do this sort of thing in your fifties. You'd just look
MASTER MIND: I see it all so clearly now.
WAYNE: Man, you ARE smart.
MASTER MIND: But why fake your death? Why go through all of it? You could have just quit.
WAYNE SCOTT: But the responsibility would still be there.
MASTER MIND: And Wayne Scott? Why did he have to Both of my lives have so much baggage. It's time for new baggage, you know?
WAYNE SCOTT: Both of my lives have so much baggage. It's time for new baggage, you know?
MASTER MIND: I just can't believe it. This whole time you've been in hiding while a force of great evil is tearing your city apart?
WAYNE SCOTT: I don't want to hear about it. That's why I don't have a television in here to remind me of all the things I SHOULD be doing. Hell, I could get a wife to do There's a demented supervillain out there about to destroy our - I mean, your city.
MASTER MIND: There's a demented supervillain out there about to destroy our - I mean, your city.
MASTER MIND: You're really going to do nothing?
WAYNE SCOTT: Good and evil have a way of balancing themselves out. If this guy is as bad as you say, somebody will rise up to fight him. It's just the order of things. You found me, didn't you?
MASTER MIND: You're the only one who can stop
WAYNE SCOTT: Couldn't if I wanted to. Gotta a plane to catch.
MASTER MIND: A plane?
WAYNE SCOTT: Going to Barbados for a little change in climate. Now, if you'll excuse me, I got to go pack.
MASTER MIND: Not smart enough to come up with a full-proof trap.
WAYNE SCOTT: Well, you did almost have me when you figured out my weakness was copper. Now that made me sweat a little. Took me way too long to drill out from under that cage.
MASTER MIND: I got lucky.
WAYNE SCOTT: Anyway, it's a good thing for my sake that I could always count on you for an out.
MASTER MIND: ( suddenly confused ) What do you mean?
WAYNE SCOTT: C'mon, we always threw each other a couple of bones. You would always leave me an out in one of your `full-proof' traps, and I'd never had you incarcerated at a penitentiary that you couldn't eventually escape from. It kept our little game going.
MASTER MIND: Game? - Was that all this ever was to you? You know, I was trying my best every time I fought you. Those `outs' as you call them were I guess I was never really a match for you, was I?
WAYNE SCOTT: MASTER MIND
MASTER MIND: I guess I was never really a match for you, was I?
WAYNE SCOTT: I think we both got what we wanted out of our relationship. She got a career out of me, and I got plenty of other things out of her. But I'm ready to move on to greener
MASTER MIND: I guess I wasn't the villain I thought I was, and you.you weren't the hero I thought you
WAYNE SCOTT: Roxanne! How long have you been.
ROXANNE: Long enough.
TITAN: Alright, I want this whole thing to look ESPN professional, understand?
PLAZA: From the five streets branching off the plaza, a dozen tanks roll toward Titan.
TANK LOUDSPEAKER: Titan, we have orders from the city of Metro to take you into custody. If you do not give your self up willingly, we will be forced to open fire.
TANK LOUDSPEAKER: What is your answer?
TITAN: ( to beer ) Miss me?
TITAN: Guys, please tell me you got that last bit.
BRAD HELMS: You're kidding me. I give you my sexiest moves and you mean to tell me it was for nothing?
TITAN: You're kidding me. I give you my sexiest moves and you mean to tell me it was for nothing?
BRAD HELMS: We were afraid something might hit Looks like I've given the story of the century to the wrong man.
TITAN: Looks like I've given the story of the century to the wrong man.
TITAN: Wait. What about that other reporter. Blond. Not so lumpy on the topper half, but killer legs.
BRAD HELMS: Roxanne. You want Roxanne. She's a much better reporter than I am. You want her.
TITAN: Where can I find her.
FRANK: We're actually not supposed to give out that sort of information.
BRAD HELMS: 1314 Mockingbird Lane. I believe she lives in a penthouse.
TITAN: You've been very helpful.
MASTER MIND: Hurry, we must be on our way as soon as possible.
DA VINCI: Master, why must we flee?
MASTER MIND: I told you, Titan is too powerful. If he's set on destroying us, there's precious little we could do about it.
DA VINCI: Where are we going?
MASTER MIND: To another city, someplace with a shitload of superheroes to fight. We'll start over, we'll go back to doing what we do best.
PLATO: With our tails between our legs?
MASTER MIND: Plato, do you have a better plan?!
ROXANNE: What are you going to do about
MASTER MIND: Right now I'm packing, later I'll have a snack on the train.
ROXANNE: You're running away?
MASTER MIND: In a word - yes.
ROXANNE: You created this monster.
MASTER MIND: I didn't create this - the god's of irony did and I am eating the crow I so richly deserve.
ROXANNE: There's no time for self pity.
MASTER MIND: I'll make the time.
ROXANNE: I'm not going anywhere.
MASTER MIND: Will you listen to me, no one can stop him.
ROXANNE: You have to try. The city needs your help.
MASTER MIND: I'm afraid you have an inflated opinion of me.
ROXANNE: What the hell's happened to you? The Master Mind I knew would never have run from a fight even though he knew deep in his heart that he didn't have a chance in hell of winning it. It was your best quality. You need to be that man right now.I.
MASTER MIND: ( heart felt ) I believe in you.
ROXANNE: ( heart felt ) I believe in you.
MASTER MIND: Sweet words, but that man is dead. Please, Roxanne, just come with me.
ROXANNE: No.I guess you are a coward after
TITAN: Man, have I got a story for you.
MASTER MIND: Roxanne? Roxanne?
TITAN: What pose would be best? The corny folded arms thing?
TITAN: Or maybe on the hips, like this.
TITAN: No, makes me look like a flamer
FRANK: ( whispering ) Shouldn't we be making a run for it right about now?
ROXANNE: ( whispering ) The guy can outrun bullets. I don't think either one of us is in that kind of shape.
TITAN: She's right, Frank.
TITAN: Also got super hearing. I promise not to keep the both of you long, but you'll thank me when this is all over.
MASTER MIND: Dad, it's me. .Bubsy. I know we haven't talked in a while, and I'm sorry. It's been a little crazy trying to live up to a legacy. Anyway.You raised me to be the worst that I could possibly be. And I've tried to live up to that as best as I could - even dropping out of dentistry school like you wanted me to. But I'm about to do something now that would really piss you off. I'm going to go against everything you ever taught me. I hope.I hope that maybe you'll look down at what I'm about to do as not so much a good deed, but more like the outright defiance of a hateful and ungrateful, son. If you could do that, then maybe - in your own little way - you could - for probably the first time - find a reason to be proud of me.

MASTER MIND: Well.either way, you're probably going to see me real soon.
MASTER MIND: Stop packing. Our work is not finished here.

DA VINCI: Sir, I think you should see this!
ROXANNE: I'm here with the cause of the destruction in Metro City. He has kidnapped me and a cameraman to chronicle what he refers to as the creation of a monument to his invincibility and overall "Asskickiness." He will use this giant concrete bowling ball to play the largest game of bowling ever using the buildings of downtown Metro City as his pins.
TITAN: And I'm going for the biggest strike ever.
TITAN: And you, Metro City, have a ringside seat as I cement my name in the anal of history.

ROXANNE: Hal, I know everyone treated you like shit, but you don't have to do You're right. I don't HAVE to do anything. Isn't that cool?
TITAN: You're right. I don't HAVE to do anything. Isn't that cool?
TITAN: Here's one for the record books!
ROXANNE: Her face is utter horror as she watches the inevitable destruction of Metro City. As the ball rolls - it demolishes everything in it's wake; cars, street lamps - windows shatter as the giant concrete sphere brushes along side buildings.
TITAN: He smiles in anticipation and uses "body English" to direct the ball.
ROXANNE: She closes her eyes. Titan's smile fades. He looks around as if he hears something we don't. About two hundred feet in front of the first building a GIANT SPIDER WEB flies across the path of the ball, creating a defensive barrier. An enormous letter "M" is etched in the web's center.
FRANK: Look, what's that flying in the
MASTER MIND: C'mon, slow down
MASTER MIND: The ball slows drastically then starts rolling to the side. It heads off an embankment and rolls harmlessly into a CANAL.
MASTER MIND: He's furious to say the least.
TITAN: He's furious to say the least.
TITAN: Master Mind gives him a mocking grin.
YOU!: Master Mind gives him a mocking grin.
MASTER MIND: Bowling? What other trailer park sports can you play?
TITAN: You are becoming a real pain in my ass. I should have done this a long time ago.
ELSEWHERE: A flustered Titan lands. He begins searching the city streets, but Master Mind is nowhere in sight. He turns upon hearing an EEKING sound to his left. Sitting on the ground is a CHIMPANZEE wearing a strange collar. It smiles at him.
TITAN: What the hell?
GODAMNIT!: The critters bite hop and hit Titan. As soon as he throws one off two more jump him. Titan breaks free and with his mighty breath blows them across the street into a fruit stand. With Titan out of their sight they begin to attack the fruit.
MASTER MIND: He's a block away frantically hitting his remote.
MASTER MIND: Shit! Stupid monkeys and their
MASTER MIND: Could it really be that easy Didn't think so.
TITAN: If you don't mind, I'm going to punch trough your face now.
MASTER MIND: I'm alive.

BYSTANDER 1: It's Uberman!
BYSTANDER 2: Uberman's alive!
BYSTANDER 3: We're saved!
MASTER MIND: I thought.
UBERMAN: So did I.
UBERMAN: Thank you, old enemy.
MASTER MIND: For what?
UBERMAN: Showing me the error of my ways, Showing me I'm meant to be this city's savior, showing me that, while we can try, there is no running away from our true destiny.
TITAN: Oh.Did I interrupt something?
TITAN: Where you going, buddy?
MASTER MIND: Titan screeches to a halt and stops just in front of him like an old Warner Bros cartoon.

MAYOR: Secret service men quickly start to draw their weapons and take aim at Master Mind. Realizing what's happening, he quickly lets the mayor's hand go and puts his arms in the air.
MASTER MIND: Sorry - Metal hand. Force of habit.
BRAD HELMS: And what about Tighten? Is there a prison in existence that can hold this super powered menace? Well, the answer we found is no.
