GUS LACEY: Look at the way it's glaring at its wheel. Usually that hamster loves its wheel.
BOB: Maybe some of the readers have hamsters so.
GUS LACEY: Good. Then they'll know how rare that is.
BOB: Yeah, I guess any hamster-owning readers will know what's aberrant behavior and, uh, what's.Oh, shit, he's down!

Here we can mend our wounds and dream our dreams. My dream is of an America that will lead the world to paradise, an America that no longer has an exploitative view of natural resources, that no longer promotes consumption at all costs. I believe this is America's destiny.

If you're aiming for a goal that isn't your destiny, you will always be swimming against the current. Young Ghandi wants to be a stock-car racer? Not gonna happen. Little Anne Frank wants to be a High School teacher. Tough titty Anne. That's not your destiny. But you will go on to move the hearts and minds of millions. Find out what your destiny is and the river will carry you. Now sometimes events in life give an individual clues as to where their Destiny lies.
