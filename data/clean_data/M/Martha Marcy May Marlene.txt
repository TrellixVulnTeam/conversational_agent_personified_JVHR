MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE: Written by Sean Durkin
LUCY: Hello. Hello?
MARTHA: Hi!
LUCY: Martha?
MARTHA: Yeah.
LUCY: Oh my god! Where are you?
MARTHA: I'm not sure. Upstate I think.
LUCY: You're in New York?
MARTHA: I think. Yeah.
LUCY: When did you get back?
LUCY (CONT'D): Martha? What's wrong? What's happened?
MARTHA: I don't know. I should go back.
LUCY: Go back where?
MARTHA: I have to go, I can't stay gone.
LUCY: No, no, no. Don't go. What are you talking about?
MARTHA: Sorry for calling.
LUCY: Martha! Don't hang up. Please! Do not hang up.
(BEAT): Do you want me to come get you?
MARTHA: I can't wait that long.
LUCY: What do you mean? Tell me where you are and I'll come right now.
MARTHA: It's okay, you don't have to-
LUCY: I want to see you Martha. Please. Martha thinks for a moment.
LUCY (CONT'D): Martha!
WATTS: What are you doin'? Martha stops eating. He slides into the booth and sits across from her. Watts reaches over and takes some french fries. He eats them slowly, enjoying every bite. She can't look at him.
WATTS (CONT'D): We were worried about you.
MARTHA: I'm fine.
WATTS: Patrick's worried about you.
MARTHA: I just wanted to come into town.
WATTS: I could've brought you.
MARTHA: I wanted to walk.
WATTS: Through the woods?
WAITRESS: Can I get you something?
WATTS: No.
WAITRESS: You done?
MARTHA: Yeah.
WATTS: You not gonna eat that? Watts takes the half grilled cheese sandwich and stuffs it into his mouth. The waitress clears the plate. Watts takes Martha's napkin and wipes the grease from his hands and mouth while he chews.
WATTS (CONT'D): You ready to go? Martha doesn't respond.
WATTS (CONT'D): Come on!
MARTHA: Not right now.
WATTS: No? The waitress drops the check on the table. Watts stares at Martha for another moment before reaching into his pocket to pull out a mess of small papers. He sorts through them and separates a $20 bill. He stuffs the rest of the papers back into his pocket. He grabs her hand, places the money in her palm and grips it closed.
WATTS (CONT'D): I'll get this. He lets go. Her hand goes limp and the money falls on the table. She does not look at him. He leans in and forces eye contact with her. Watts, growing increasingly tense, stands up and glances around the diner. It is very busy. He does not want to make a scene in front of all these people. He leans down and kisses Martha on the cheek. She doesn't kiss back. He holds his forehead to her forehead until she reacts. She reluctantly kisses him on the lips. Martha watches him walk outside. As soon as his back is turned, she gets up, runs through the diner, and suddenly cuts through the kitchen.
LUCY: It's nice to see you.
MARTHA: You too. Lucy notices that Martha's left ear is bruised.
LUCY: What's going on?
MARTHA: Not much.
LUCY: You alright?
MARTHA: Yeah.
LUCY: You sure?
MARTHA: Yeah.
LUCY: You were pretty upset on the phone.
MARTHA: Sorry. I over reacted.
LUCY: To what? Martha thinks.
LUCY (CONT'D): What happened?
MARTHA: We had a fight.
LUCY: Who?
MARTHA: Me and this guy.
LUCY: Who? Martha doesn't answer.
LUCY (CONT'D): Your boyfriend? Martha nods.
LUCY (CONT'D): Did he hurt you?
MARTHA: No!
LUCY: Are you sure?
MARTHA: No. I'm fine. Lucy is skeptical.
LUCY: Did you guys break up? Martha nods.
LUCY (CONT'D): How long were you together?
MARTHA: A while.
LUCY: How long?
MARTHA: I don't know. Maybe a year, maybe more or less.
LUCY: And you were here the whole time? Martha nods.
LUCY (CONT'D): You've been back in New York for over a year and you haven't called me?
MARTHA: I'm sorry. Lucy is upset but manages to remain calm.
LUCY: Well, I'm glad you're here now.
LUCY: I made you some tea.
MARTHA: Thanks. Lucy takes a small hand towel and dries Martha's hair.
LUCY: Ted should be up from the city soon. He'll cook us some dinner.
MARTHA: I'm pretty tired, is it okay if I just go to bed?
LUCY: Of course.
(BEAT): Get some sleep, you'll be as good as new tomorrow.
TED: Well?
LUCY: She seems okay.
TED: What did she say?
LUCY: Not much, she's pretty tired.
TED: Where's she been?
LUCY: She had some boyfriend, they were living in the Catskills.
TED: What?
LUCY: It's okay.
TED: Not really Lucy.
LUCY: It's fine. She's here now. Ted keeps his comments to himself.
TED: Well, how long's she staying?
LUCY: I don't know.
TED: I told you she was fine. You spend all that time worrying. Ted kisses her on the forehead and walks to the liquor cabinet and pours a scotch.
LUCY: Martha? Why are you on the floor? Martha does not know where she is. A moment passes before she starts to come to.
MARTHA: I'm sorry.
LUCY: It's okay, you were in a deep sleep. Come have some breakfast.
TED: Martha! Welcome!
MARTHA: Hi.
TED: Great to finally meet you. You sleep alright?
MARTHA: Yeah.
LUCY: How do you like the house?
TED: It's just a rental.
LUCY: Well I love it. Lucy puts some eggs on a plate for Martha.
MARTHA: It's nice. I didn't know there was a lake.
LUCY: Yeah. Do you still like to swim?
MARTHA: You don't live in the city anymore?
LUCY: We do. This is for weekends and holidays. Ted and Lucy eat, Martha takes miniscule bites.
LUCY (CONT'D): Ted's finishing a new building down town and when it's done we're taking one of the new apartments. You want to see pictures? Lucy gets up from the table and walks to another room. Martha sniffs her food. Ted doesn't notice.
TED: Do you think she's excited to have you back? Lucy re-enters with her digital camera.
LUCY: This is the view, the interiors are obviously not finished. It's nice right?
LUCY (CONT'D): We were supposed to move in the spring but construction halted, so, it'll just be a little while longer.
TED: Yep, just a little while longer.
LUCY: Okay, sorry, no more work talk. Lucy notices that Martha isn't eating.
LUCY (CONT'D): Aren't you hungry?
MARTHA: Not really, sorry.
TED: Well, you've got to eat.
LUCY: It's okay, I can fix you something later. Martha, feeling on the spot, forces down a big bite.
MARTHA: Where are we?
LUCY: Connecticut.
MARTHA: How far are we?
LUCY: From what?
MARTHA: Yesterday. Lucy is confused. She tries to make sense of the question.
LUCY: You mean where I picked you up?
LUCY (CONT'D): About 3 hours.
(BEAT): Why?
MARTHA: Just wondered. Lucy goes back to reading. Martha lies down and stares at the sky. A light banging sound starts to echo over the lake.
CUT TO:: Martha lies in the open field smoking cigarettes with ZOE, a girl in her early twenties. Martha is younger, more energetic and confident. They are laughing and talking when Zoe notices Patrick walking towards them.
ZOE: Put out your cigarette.
MARTHA: Why?
ZOE: Just do it. They put out their cigarettes. Zoe buries them in the grass. Patrick approaches them.
MARTHA: Is that him?
ZOE: Yeah.
(CALLING OUT): Hey!
PATRICK: Is this Martha?
MARTHA: Hi!
PATRICK: How're you doing? Patrick crouches down over Zoe but smiles at Martha.
MARTHA: Great. You've got a really nice place here.
PATRICK: It's as much yours as it is mine. He glances at her legs, then back up to her face. He turns his attention to Zoe.
PATRICK (CONT'D): I thought you quit?
ZOE: I did.
PATRICK: It's disgusting.
ZOE: I know. I'm sorry.
PATRICK: Don't apologize to me, it's your body. Patrick gestures towards Martha.
PATRICK (CONT'D): Look after this girl properly Zoe, she deserves some real care for once in her life.
ZOE: I will.
MARTHA: She's been great, everyone's been great.
PATRICK: Good.
(BEAT): You look like a Marcy May.
MARTHA: Marcy was my grandmothers name.
PATRICK: Well, there you go. He continues to walk through the field. Zoe and Martha recline into the grass and continue talking.
MARTHA: Sure. Martha stands up and brushes herself off.
MARTHA (CONT'D): You coming?
TED: Brilliant choice of swim wear. Lucy is not amused. Ted walks away laughing. He turns to sneak one more glimpse of Martha.
LUCY: Martha! What are you doing?
MARTHA: What?
LUCY: Would you put some clothes on, you can't swim naked.
MARTHA: Why?
LUCY: You just can't. There are kids around and people come by.
MARTHA: So?
LUCY: So you can't. We don't, just don't. I have a bathing suit you can borrow. Martha gets out of the water. Lucy wraps the towel around her and walks away. Martha dries off. She feels embarrassed.
LUCY: Martha!
(BEAT): I've been trying to wake you. You should get up or you won't sleep through the night. Martha wakes up.
LUCY (CONT'D): You should eat.
MARTHA: I will. I'm just going to sleep a little more first okay?
LUCY: Okay. I'm sorry I got frustrated with you before.
MARTHA: It's okay. Lucy leaves. Martha opens the window and dumps the pasta outside then goes back to sleep.
TED: She's not coming?
LUCY: She's in a really deep sleep. I can't wake her.
TED: She seems a bit off, no?
LUCY: She's just really tired.
(BEAT): She's had a bad breakup. I want to give her a couple days to get situated, you know?
TED: Has she always been like this?
LUCY: A pain in my ass, yes. They laugh.
MAX: Hey Marcy.
MARTHA: Hey Max.
(BEAT): Where do they go at night?
MAX: I don't know, I never get invited. He jumps over the banister and reaches under the porch.
MAX (CONT'D): You want to have a drink with me? He pulls out a little flask and shakes it. A mischievous smile grows on his face.
MAX (CONT'D): They won't be back for a few hours.
MARTHA: I shouldn't. I'm not going to drink for awhile, I think it's a good idea for me.
MAX: Alright.
MARTHA: Patrick'll know.
MAX: It's cool, I'm good at hiding it.
KATIE: We switch off jobs each day so we all know how to do different things.
(BEAT): Do you knit?
MARTHA: No. I can learn though.
KATIE: It's okay, you'll find your role. It takes time for people to find their role in a new family. Katie pours the cleaner on the floor, it sloshes around.
KATIE (CONT'D): We sell blankets in town. We still need some money, but when the farm's up and running we'll be self sufficient and we'll never have to worry about it again.
MARTHA: When do you think that'll happen?
KATIE: Hopefully by the end of the summer but we'll see. It's hard to get machinery and live stock without cash.
MARTHA: That'll be nice. Katie accidentally drops a plate.
KATIE: Shoot. Martha gets down and starts to clean it up.
PATRICK: How's everything going so far Marcy May?
MARTHA: Good. The guys stop playing music.
PATRICK: You like it here?
MARTHA: Yeah, it's really nice.
PATRICK: I want you to feel at home.
MARTHA: I do. Thanks.
PATRICK: People have abandoned you your whole life. I don't blame you for not trusting anyone.
MARTHA: What?
PATRICK: If you ever want to have a meaningful relationship, you need to let your guard down. Martha is embarrassed and feels on the spot.
PATRICK (CONT'D): It's not your fault, but it's there. If you feel safe here, and I think you do, let us in. We just want to help you.
ZOE: Yeah, we think you're fucking awesome.
PATRICK: If you're going to live here then really be apart of things.
LUCY: Good morning. How are you feeling today?
MARTHA: Good.
LUCY: There's this great juice shop in town, I got us a couple of juices.
LUCY (CONT'D): This one is Kale with ginseng. It gives me energy, so I thought it might help you. Martha takes a sip. It tastes terrible but she drinks it.
LUCY (CONT'D): I got pineapple orange too if that's better.
MARTHA: Maybe that's better. Sorry, thanks.
LUCY: I also got a box of these protein bars just in case you want to snack. Martha watches Lucy put the groceries away.
MARTHA: Why is the house so big?
LUCY: It's not that big.
MARTHA: For two people, it's huge.
LUCY: We like to entertain. Our friends come up for weekends and sometimes we have parties. It's just good to have space.
MARTHA: So no one else lives here?
LUCY: Of course no one else lives here.
MARTHA: You're married?
LUCY: Yeah.
MARTHA: When?
LUCY: Earlier this year, in the spring. There is an awkward silence.
LUCY (CONT'D): I tried to get in touch with you, apparently you got rid of your cell phone?
MARTHA: I lost it.
LUCY: You never got a new one?
MARTHA: I got used to not having it.
TED: Cocktail anyone?
LUCY: No thanks.
TED: Martha? Martha shakes her head. Ted walks to the back of the boat. Martha has to stand up to let him pass through the narrow walk way. He brushes up against her as he squeezes by.
MARTHA: Was it a big wedding?
LUCY: No, about forty people. Mostly his family.
MARTHA: Did Aunt Dora come?
LUCY: Yeah.
MARTHA: Did she smoke like chimney and complain about everything.
LUCY: She's not that bad.
MARTHA: You never had to live with her.
TED: You lived with Dora?
MARTHA: She lived with me after mom died.
TED: Where were you?
LUCY: College. Lucy picks up her Polaroid camera and frames up Martha.
LUCY (CONT'D): Well I'm sure she'd love to know you're okay.
MARTHA: She hates me.
LUCY: She doesn't hate you.
(BEAT): Look at me.
MARTHA: I hate her. Martha notices the camera and quickly turns away.
LUCY: Relax, I don't have any pictures of you.
(LUCY FOCUSES): Jesus you're gorgeous. It's annoying. Martha cracks a smile. Lucy snaps the shot.
LUCY (CONT'D): There you go! Lucy hands Martha the Polaroid, she shakes it.
LUCY (CONT'D): Don't shake it, that's a myth. Martha looks deep in thought, she continues to shake the Polaroid.
MARTHA: Is it true married people don't fuck?
LUCY: What? No! Ted walks back to the front of the boat and looks at Martha's ass as he passes. Martha is embarrassed. She stares at the Polaroid.
LUCY: Put this on.
MARTHA: You're kidding.
LUCY: Your clothes are disgusting Martha, just try it.
MARTHA: Why does it matter?
LUCY: It just feels good to put on something nice and comfortable. Martha slips on the dress and a funny pose.
LUCY (CONT'D): It looks good you little shit.
MARTHA: Whatever makes you happy mama bear.
LUCY: You're making fun of me and I think it looks really good. They both laugh.
LUCY: It's no good?
TED: It's good, it's just, a bit dry.
LUCY: It's not dry. Martha laughs. Ted starts laughing. Lucy tries it again.
LUCY (CONT'D): It just needs a little salt. What are you laughing about I cooked for you your whole life.
MARTHA: You microwaved chicken nuggets and fish sticks. Ted and Martha continue to laugh. Lucy gets up from the table. She comes back with salt and dumps it on the food.
TED: She seems better today.
LUCY: Yeah. I wish I didn't have to go tomorrow.
TED: Let me take you.
LUCY: No, I don't want to leave her alone.
(BEAT): You'll be nice to her right?
TED: I'm always nice.
LUCY: Right. They laugh and kiss.
KATIE: I know you feel like something bad just happened Marcy May, but you have to trust me, that was not bad, it was truly good. We've all been in this situation, and we wouldn't all still be here if what happened in that room was bad. We all love each other very much, we are all together on this, you have to trust us.
(BEAT): Do you believe me? Martha nods.
ZOE: You're so lucky, I'd give anything to have my first time again.
MARTHA: Really?
ZOE: Yeah, it's so special.
MARTHA: I can't remember anything, I just woke up on the floor and felt this pain -
ZOE: That's the cleansing. It's good. It means it's working if you can't remember things. You're cleansing yourself of the past and the toxins. Martha is distant.
ZOE (CONT'D): You need to share yourself, don't be so selfish.
MARTHA: I'm not.
ZOE: So smile then, enjoy this amazing night. It only happens once. Zoe rests her forehead against Martha's forehead. They curl up together in a very intimate way. Martha smiles. Zoe kisses her on the lips. Martha is caught off guard. She laughs. They have a second peck on the lips before closing their eyes to sleep.
PATRICK: This one's called Marcy's song.
PATRICK (CONT'D): Well she, she's just a picture. Who lives on my wall Well she, she's just a picture And the reason, reason, reason it is so small. With a smile so inviting and a body so tall, She, she's just a picture Just a picture
THAT'S ALL: Well you stand there, stand there with the nightshade, Her dripping ripping down your hands And you ask me, ask me about the
LIGHTNING: And the lady, lady, lady she understands It's a dream for the future and the water for the sands And the strangeness is wandering Through many callin' lands
TED: What are you doing?
MARTHA: Cleaning.
(BEAT): I thought I'd help out more.
TED: Alright. I'm going to take the boat out, do you want to come?
MARTHA: Is Lucy coming?
TED: She had to run to the city.
MARTHA: Oh.
TED: I'll teach you how to drive the boat, come on.
MARTHA: It's okay.
TED: Come on.
TED: You want one? Ted hands her a beer. She stares at the beer and hesitates before taking a giant chug.
TED (CONT'D): Beautiful day.
MARTHA: Yeah.
TED: How have things been with you and Lucy?
MARTHA: Fine.
TED: Is it strange to spend time together?
MARTHA: No. Why?
TED: It's been a long time.
MARTHA: I don't know, it's normal I guess. She hasn't changed much. Martha takes a swig of her beer.
MARTHA (CONT'D): Where is she?
TED: At the doctor.
MARTHA: Why?
TED: She's getting a check up.
(BEAT): We're trying to have a baby. Martha laughs to herself. The beer is affecting her.
TED (CONT'D): What?
MARTHA: I can't imagine it Lucy holding a child.
TED: Why?
MARTHA: She wouldn't know what to do with it.
(BEAT): Do you want a baby? He gets up and opens two more beers.
TED: I want what Lucy wants.
(SMILING): If she's happy, I'm happy. He hands one to Martha and sits down again.
MARTHA: So you're unhappy! Ted laughs.
TED: No. She's good. She's relieved to have you back. You had her worried.
MARTHA: Why?
TED: You disappeared. You haven't called in two years!
MARTHA: I lost track I guess.
TED: It's good to let people know where you are Martha. People worry.
MARTHA: I didn't think Lucy would worry about me.
TED: Well, she did. There is another awkward silence. They both drink their beer.
MARTHA: Can I go swimming?
TED: You don't need to ask. Martha takes off her clothes. She is wearing a bikini that Lucy gave her. It does not quite fit. The bathing suit sags and top of her ass shows. Ted tries not to look.
PATRICK: You jump yet?
MARTHA: No.
PATRICK: Go on. Watts swims by and guides her out of the water. Watts and Martha ascend up a narrow dirt path to the top of a rock face.
WATTS: You ready?
MARTHA: I can't.
WATTS: Sure you can. Watts jumps. Martha stands alone at the top of the cliff naked. Everyone is looking up at her cheering her on. She builds up the courage and jumps. She hits the water, everything goes dark. The frame fills with tiny bubbles, she comes up for air exhilarated. She continues to swim, the camera follows her under water. The darkness of the water makes the screen go black.
LUCY: What? What? Ted gestures to Martha.
LUCY (CONT'D): Martha, what are you doing?
MARTHA: Nothing! Ted turns on the light. He sits on the edge of the bed.
LUCY: Jesus, you can't just come in like that.
MARTHA: Sorry. Martha gets up to leave.
LUCY: God damn it, what's wrong? Martha stops and stands facing the door.
MARTHA: It's been hard to sleep alone.
TED: All you do is sleep.
LUCY: Stay, just stay. Martha comes back and sits on the bed.
LUCY (CONT'D): Why would you think it was okay to come in like that?
MARTHA: I don't know. It's a big bed, you guys were on the other side.
LUCY: You can't come into our room when we're having sex, that's not normal! It's private.
MARTHA: Sorry.
LUCY: Don't apologize, I just want you to understand why it's not okay.
MARTHA: Okay.
LUCY: Do you?
MARTHA: Yeah.
LUCY: Well?
MARTHA: Because it's privte and it's not normal. Lucy can see something is really wrong.
LUCY: Just lie down Martha. Martha lies in Lucy's lap. Lucy is uncomfortable with the contact, she pushes Martha's head onto a pillow.
TED: This is just brilliant. Ted stands up and puts on his sweatpants and walks out. Martha closes her eyes.
LUCY: I'm sorry you slept out here. Thanks for being patient.
TED: I don't have much choice do I?
LUCY: I just want to make sure she's okay.
TED: I get two weeks a year to come out here and try to relax before I have to go back to work!
LUCY: I know.
TED: I am under so much pressure right now-
LUCY: I know you are.
TED: I have a month to get this building up and running or the bank takes it.
LUCY: That has nothing to do with Martha.
TED: My point is, I don't need the extra stress.
LUCY: I'm her only family. She needs to be able to depend on me right now.
(BEAT): It's complicated Ted.
TED: As complicated as it might be, we can't just keep ignoring the fact that her behavior is fucking insane. Martha pretends to go back to sleep.
MARTHA: Do you ever hear things hitting the roof at night?
LUCY: No. Maybe it's the pine cones.
(BEAT): Where did you pick up gardening?
MARTHA: We had a garden where I lived?
LUCY: You're good.
MARTHA: I'm good at some things.
LUCY: I know you are. They continue to work. Lucy builds up the courage.
LUCY (CONT'D): Was he ever physical with you?
MARTHA: Who?
LUCY: Your boyfriend.
MARTHA: What do you mean?
LUCY: Did he ever, hit you?
MARTHA: No.
LUCY: You had a bruised ear, and when you called me you were hysterical. Martha feels her ear.
LUCY (CONT'D): Are you sure?
MARTHA: Yes.
LUCY: You can tell me.
MARTHA: He never hit me. Beat.
LUCY: I wish you felt more comfortable talking to me.
MARTHA: I do.
LUCY: So talk.
MARTHA: There's nothing to talk about. I had a boyfriend, he lied to me, I left. That's it, everything doesn't have to be a big
KATIE: Don't stare! Zoe walks back to the garden.
MARTHA: You okay?
ZOE: Yeah. He's right. I don't know why I'm so weak.
MARTHA: You're not. You'll quit. An OLD BROWN CAR pulls into the driveway. A YOUNG GIRL, no more than fifteen years old gets out.
MARTHA (CONT'D): Who's that?
KATIE: Her name's Sarah I think. TWO WOMEN welcome SARAH and walk her into the house.
KATIE (CONT'D): You should handle her.
MARTHA: You think?
KATIE: You're ready. Zoe can help but you'll be great.
MARTHA: Whose car was that?
LUCY: I don't know. Why?
MARTHA: Just curious.
LUCY: There's a hiking trail, people leave their cars there all the time.
LUCY: Sorry.
YOUNG MAN: It's okay. The young man walks down the isle. Martha watches him go.
LUCY: You're going to hurt someone. Martha is distracted.
LUCY (CONT'D): Can you go get me a large jug of water.
MARTHA: What's wrong with the tap?
LUCY: I like bottled.
MARTHA: It's a waste.
LUCY: Will you get it or not?
MARTHA: Did you know that guy?
LUCY: What guy?
MARTHA: The guy in the store.
LUCY: The one you almost ran into? No.
MARTHA: He was looking at me like he knew me.
(BEAT): Did you say something to him?
LUCY: Like what?
MARTHA: I don't know, you tell me.
LUCY: What are you talking about?
MARTHA: He was staring at me like he knew me, did you talk to him about me?
LUCY: No. Jesus. The guy was checking you out Martha! Relax. (Lucy starts the car.)
LUCY (CONT'D): If you don't want guys to drool all over you, then wear more clothes-
MARTHA: Just drive the car Lucy.
LUCY: What?
MARTHA: Drive the car!
LUCY: I don't think we should have the party.
TED: It's labor day, we always have it.
LUCY: Things are just too stressful right now.
TED: I've already invited clients.
LUCY: I'm sure people would understand-
TED: They wouldn't.
LUCY: I just think it would be best.
TED: For who, Martha?
LUCY: For all of us.
TED: It's not an option! We're having the party.
LUCY: And that's the end of it, because you say so.
TED: Yes!
MARTHA: We share all of this, if it fits, you can wear it.
SARAH: Cool. They walk into a small bedroom.
MARTHA: This is where we sleep. You can take any bed that's open or you can sleep downstairs. They walk downstairs. And see another large bedroom.
SARAH: I'm hungry, can we eat?
MARTHA: We don't eat until the evening.
SARAH: Really? At the bottom of the stairs, several make shift beds are laid out on the floor.
MARTHA: You'll get used to it. Your body doesn't need that much food. You're taught to overconsume. There is a baby asleep in the crib.
SARAH: He's beautiful. Whose the mother?
MARTHA: Katie's, but we all help out.
SARAH: Is Patrick the father?
MARTHA: Uh huh.
SARAH: They look just like him.
(BEAT): All the kids here are boys? Martha picks one up, she is very natural with him.
MARTHA: He only has boys.
SARAH: You're good with them.
MARTHA: You want to hold him?
SARAH: No Thanks.
(BEAT): I don't have to take care of them do I?
MARTHA: Not if you don't want to. There are plenty of jobs to be done.
(BEAT): You'll find your role. It takes time for people to find their role in a new family.
ZOE: I called my dad today to ask for money.
MARTHA: Does Patrick know?
ZOE: He asked me to. Sometimes, if there's something we really need I'll call.
MARTHA: How was it?
ZOE: Fine, they're not bad people.
MARTHA: Did he give you the money?
ZOE: Yeah. He thinks I'm on drugs.
MARTHA: Do you tell him you're not?
ZOE: No, that's why he gives it to me. I guess he'd rather pay for it than think I'm sucking dick for it.
SARAH: I've done drugs. Not a lot but I've tried everything pretty much, except heroin.
ZOE: It's good to try everything at least once. You find out who you are that way. What about drinking, do you drink?
SARAH: I have, but I don't.
ZOE: Good, we don't drink. It just makes you angry and less focused.
MARTHA: Don't get the wrong idea Sarah. We don't talk to our old families.
SARAH: I wouldn't call my Dad anyway, no matter how much he paid me. Patrick and Watts walk out of the woods.
PATRICK: Hey.
MARTHA: Hi Patrick, Did you meet Sarah yet?
PATRICK: Sally, yeah.
KATIE: That's enough. Katie hands her a large chalky white pill.
KATIE (CONT'D): Half is fine. Martha breaks the tablet in half and drops it into the drink. She crushes it with a spoon.
LUCY: I'll do these if you want to go to bed.
MARTHA: I don't mind.
LUCY: Get some sleep.
MARTHA: Okay. Martha leaves. Holding the glass tightly, Martha walks to her bedroom.
MARTHA: Oh, hi.
SARAH: Hi. Sarah is nervous. Martha brushes Sarah's hair.
SARAH (CONT'D): What do I have to do?
MARTHA: Nothing you don't want to. Drink this, it will help you relax. Sarah takes a sip of a thick green drink. She gags.
MARTHA (CONT'D): It's herbal. It's the start of your cleansing. Martha lifts the bottom of the glass to force it down.
MARTHA (CONT'D): We've all done it so you know there's nothing to worry about.
SARAH: Do I have to wear this robe?
MARTHA: I know it seems a bit silly, but it's a part of it. Sarah looks very uncomfortable. She is getting light headed from the drink.
MARTHA (CONT'D): You look amazing. It's your special night with him, enjoy it, you'll be great.
SARAH: Thanks. Martha helps Sarah up and passes her through a door to the next room. She removes Sarah's robe and lays her on the ground. Martha shuts the door locking her in. Martha lies down on the floor and curls up into a ball.
MARTHA: Shouldn't we start cooking?
LUCY: I just made some potato salad. Ted's cooking the fish.
MARTHA: I thought we were going to cook.
LUCY: We cooked last night.
MARTHA: Oh, yeah. Martha is lost deep in thought.
MARTHA (CONT'D): Do you ever have this thing where you can't tell if something's a memory or if it's something you've dreamed?
LUCY: Not really. Beat.
LUCY (CONT'D): Do you blame me for anything?
MARTHA: No.
(BEAT): Like what?
LUCY: I don't know.
(BEAT): I'm just trying to figure out why we stopped talking.
MARTHA: I didn't think about it.
LUCY: Really?
MARTHA: We were far apart.
LUCY: Sometimes I wonder if, maybe I could have taken better care of you.
MARTHA: The past doesn't matter.
LUCY: It does matter.
MARTHA: I took care of myself.
LUCY: I know you did. I think I could have done more though.
MARTHA: Stop it.
LUCY: Be honest with me, you never think about it?
MARTHA: No.
LUCY: You're not angry at me?
MARTHA: I know you don't think much of me but I knew what I was doing then and I still do.
LUCY: No, Martha, I think the world of you, I'm just wondering if I should have come back and kept you in school and helped you go to college, you had so much potential.
MARTHA: I don't need your guidance, I never did. I'm a teacher and a leader, you just never let me be that but now I know I am, I know who I am.
LUCY: Teacher and a leader? What are you talking about? I always encouraged you to do more, but you shut me out. Martha doesn't respond she drifts off into deep thought.
MARTHA: Just because we're sisters doesn't mean we need to talk about everything that comes into your head.
TED: So what are your plans Martha?
MARTHA: For what?
TED: Life.
MARTHA: I don't know.
TED: Are you thinking about what you can do for work?
MARTHA: No.
TED: You're at an age where you need to start thinking about a career.
MARTHA: Why?
TED: It's a part of adult life.
MARTHA: There are other ways to live.
TED: Really?
MARTHA: Sure.
TED: Like what?
MARTHA: I don't know. People don't need careers, people should just exist. Ted laughs.
LUCY: He's just saying we should start talking about what you're interested in. Maybe we can help you get some ideas together.
TED: I have moments when I would love to move to France and just exist but it doesn't work that way.
MARTHA: You can do that if you want to.
TED: It's not that simple.
MARTHA: It's not your fault but you learned that success is measured by money and possessions. It's just not the right way to live.
TED: And what do you think the right way to live is? Being a hysterical mess and causing your family pain. You're eating my food and sleeping under my roof so watch your mouth. You're rude. Martha, with a frightening streak of viciousness stands up to Ted.
MARTHA: You don't know anything about it. Ted and Lucy are speechless. Martha leaves.
WOMAN: Hello...Hello.
MARTHA: Who's this?
WOMAN: Who's this?
(BEAT): Zoe?
MARTHA: She not there?
WOMAN: She's not.
MARTHA: Where is she?
WOMAN: Who is this?
MARTHA: Who is this?
WOMAN: It's Marlene Lewis. Who's this.
MAX: Watts said I'm supposed to teach you how to defend yourselves but I think you're hopeless.
ZOE: I'm surprised your dumb ass even knows how to load it.
MAX: Please, I'm like Doc fuckin' Holiday. Zoe shoots and hits a bottle. He comes up behind Zoe, wraps his arms around her, kisses her neck and gropes her breasts. She moves his hands away. Sarah watches on.
MAX (CONT'D): God, you are so hot when you shoot, makes my willy hard. Max takes the gun out of her hand and fires several shots. He misses the bottles.
ZOE: What happened Doc? I should be teaching you. He loads another round, aims, shoots, and hits a bottle.
MARTHA: Alright, my turn. Max wraps his hands around hers so she is firmly gripping the gun.
ZOE: Alright Max, was this just an excuse to grope Marcy.
MAX: I'm teaching her how to shoot. Then you just squeeeeeeeeeze. Patrick is walking towards them carrying a sac. Martha fires a few shots and misses.
PATRICK: Focus. Take a deep breath. Think about someone who wronged you. Feel it, feel how they made you feel in your stomach. Take a deep breath, feel it all moving out into your hands. Let it build. It's transferring to the gun, building in the gun. Now release. She fires five powerful shots quickly, one shatters. A smile grows on martha's face.
PATRICK (CONT'D): Feels good right? Martha nods. Patrick opens a sac and lets 2 cats out.
PATRICK (CONT'D): Now try that.
MARTHA: What do you mean?
PATRICK: Shoot it.
MARTHA: They're living animals.
PATRICK: So, shoot Max then. Patrick lifts Martha's hand so the gun is pointing at Max. Max is frozen, he smiles awkwardly.
PATRICK (CONT'D): Go on! Max is confused, he gets embarrassed.
MAX: Fuck this.
PATRICK: Don't walk away from me Max. Max stops. Martha drops the gun down to her waist.
PATRICK (CONT'D): The cat has terminal cancer, it's in excruciating pain.
MARTHA: I can't.
PATRICK: Max has no substance, he's just here to free load and be around the girls but you're a teacher and leader, you just don't see it because no one let you believe it before me. You're a leader a Marcy, now prove it. Martha is shook up. She does not fire the gun.
PATRICK (CONT'D): The cat reminds you of some fluffy thing you think you used to love. You're holding on to some false emotion that stops you from doing what's right. Zoe takes the gun out of Martha's hand. The gun goes off. Martha and Max jump. Zoe shot the cat without blinking. She hands the gun back to Martha.
PATRICK (CONT'D): I could spend my life being selfish, living alone, using this gift for me but I've sacrificed myself to be what you all need me to be. You need to trust me.
MARTHA: I trust you.
PATRICK: Then you shouldn't need me to explain everything. A gun shot goes off. They all look up. Max looks mortified, he has shot the other cat.
PATRICK (CONT'D): What did you do?
MAX: You said it was sick.
PATRICK: One of them was sick, Zoe knew which one it was! Max tosses the gun and walks away.
MARTHA: You okay?
MAX: I'm fine.
(BEAT): I'll probably leave this place soon anyways.
MARTHA: Where are you going to go?
MAX: I got places. My cousin lives in Bennington, he said I could go up there and make like, $500 a week selling weed.
MARTHA: You don't want to do that.
MAX: I don't care what I do. I'm sick of all these rules.
MARTHA: Max, they're not rules. It's just common sense.
MAX: It feels like rules. They won't let me do anything. I can't even go on the house runs. I'd be great at taking shit.
MARTHA: It's not about taking shit.
MAX: Sounds like it's about taking shit to me.
MARTHA: And that's why you don't get to come. You just don't get it.
(BEAT): You need to quit drinking.
MAX: I'm not drinking. Martha takes the bottle out from under a hay bale.
MARTHA: You're still living with all the shit you carried out there. You're the only one, let it go.
MAX: I'll try.
MARTHA: No. You can't try. You have to stop. They love you, they just want you to be stronger.
MAX: I'm strong, they'll see. Max leans up and tries to kiss her. Martha stops him. She hugs him instead.
MARTHA: You'll be okay.
TED: Jesus Christ you scared me.
MARTHA: Sorry. They take a moment to calm down.
TED: Did I wake you?
MARTHA: No. I can't sleep.
TED: Me neither. I was going to watch a movie.
(BEAT): You want to watch? Martha thinks about it.
MARTHA: I should try to sleep.
TED: It always helps me. It's better than lying in bed awake. He takes a couple of beers out of the fridge.
TED: I'm sorry about before, Martha.
MARTHA: It's alright. It's your house. Martha lies down. He offers her a pillow. She raises her head and he puts it under.
TED: You want me to make some breakfast? Lucy walks away.
TED (CONT'D): Hey! Ted follows her into their room.
TED: What's wrong?
LUCY: You can not be serious right now.
TED: What? Beat.
TED (CONT'D): Lucy!
LUCY: One minute you're going after Martha at the dinner table, then you're curling up together on the couch?
TED: No one was curling up with anybody.
LUCY: You really do think I'm stupid don't you?
TED: Jesus, I couldn't sleep, I was watching a movie, she came out and sat down and started watching with me. What am I supposed to do, tell her to leave? Beat.
TED (CONT'D): You're being ridiculous.
LUCY: You can lose your temper at will but when I get pissed off, I'm being crazy or ridiculous! I couldn't possibly be mad for a reason. Lucy gets undressed and gets in the shower.
TED: Are you accusing me of something? Because if you are, I'd like you to say it out loud so you can hear how absurd it sounds.
LUCY: Fuck you. I just want you to think about how walking in on that might make me feel.
TED: You ask me to make more of an effort. I try to do that and you get upset. I can't win.
LUCY: You're unbelievable.
MARTHA: You shouldn't smoke.
LUCY: What? I don't smoke.
MARTHA: Especially if you're trying to have a kid.
LUCY: Maybe you should mind your own business. The phone rings. It startles Martha.
LUCY (CONT'D): I can't deal with talking to anyone right now. Martha is frozen, watching the phone ring.
MARTHA: What's you name?
BARTENDER: I'm sorry?
MARTHA: What's your name?
BARTENDER: Mike. He puts out his hand to shake hers. She takes a half step back and studies his face.
BARTENDER (CONT'D): Can I get you something?
MARTHA: I used to like this. She points at the tequila.
BARTENDER: Straight? She stands there looking dazed. She doesn't respond. He just pours it. He is confused by her.
MARTHA: I thought you weren't supposed to drink Mike.
BARTENDER: I'm not drinking. He hands her the tequila. She suddenly slaps it out of his hand. The glass shatters on the ground.
MARTHA: You think you're so fucking smart. Martha storms inside. Lucy follows her in.
LUCY: Hey, what happenind?
MARTHA: We all need to leave.
LUCY: What?
MARTHA: He's a fucking liar. We all need to leave. She points to the bartender.
LUCY: What are you talking about? Lucy lowers Martha's pointing hand and tries to move her away.
MARTHA: We have to leave. We all have to leave. I know him.
LUCY: Who?
LUCY (CONT'D): What the fuck is wrong with you?
MARTHA: You don't want to live with this Lucy.
LUCY: Martha.
TED: Calm down. Ted approaches and helps guide Martha into their bedroom. Lucy turns around to check the party. People are starting to notice. Lucy and Ted force Martha back into their bedroom. He closes the door.
LUCY: What are you talking about?
MARTHA: They're here. Martha is frantic, she begins to hyperventilate. Lucy tries to hug her, Martha squirms free. Lucy hugs her again and pulls her onto the bed, trying to get her to calm.
LUCY: Breath.
MARTHA: Don't touch me, you're not listening to me!
LUCY: Martha please try to breath. I don't know what you're talking about. Ted walks into the bathroom and gets pills. He forces them down and makes Martha drink water. She calms down. She falls back onto the bed. Ted and Lucy look exhausted.
MAN: What the fuck.
WATTS: Hey, we can go. The man is confused.
MAN: What do you want?
WATTS: Nothing. The man goes to pick up the phone to call the police. Watts stops, turns and get's in his face.
WATTS (CONT'D): No need for that, we are leaving. Watts, Zoe and Martha walk to the front door. Patrick appears behind the man.
PATRICK: Calm down, if you calm down no one will get hurt.
MAN: What do you want?
PATRICK: We're not stealing, we don't want anything.
MAN: Just get out.
PATRICK: We're just looking at the house. It's nice.
(BEAT): We didn't realize you were home. We wouldn't have come in otherwise.
MAN: Just Leave.
PATRICK: I would but I can't be sure you won't call the police.
MAN: I won't. You didn't take anything so just go, I just want my family to be safe.
PATRICK: Safe? Why wouldn't anyone be safe. Unless you call the police, everything will be fine.
MAN: Okay, I won't. You have my word, please just go. Martha walk outside. Patrick just stands there, he won't leave. Katie and Zoe walk out of the other room and are standing behind the Man. They don't move. He feels surrounded.
MAN (CONT'D): Get the fuck out of my house. Martha looks back but the view is blocked by the door. No one knows what to do. The girls are looking to Patrick but he's not doing anything. Suddenly Katie lunges at the man and stabs him in the neck. Blood spurts out and she stabs him again in the ribs. They all run out.
PATRICK: Look at me. Patrick runs his hands through her hair.
PATRICK (CONT'D): You okay?
MARTHA: Uh huh. There is a long silence. Martha is clearly not okay.
PATRICK: You know that death is the most beautiful part of life, right? Death is beautiful because everyone fears death. And fear is the greatest human emotion of all because it creates complete awareness. When you're scared it forces you to be completely aware of your surroundings and the moment you're in. It brings you to NOW and that makes you truly present. And when you are truly present, that's nirvana, that's pure love. So, death is pure love.
LUCY: It's too hot, let it cool for a minute. She smiles, lies down and curls up again. She is half asleep.
MARTHA: Thanks mom. I'm sorry I ruined the party.
LUCY: Everything was fine.
MARTHA: Is it over?
LUCY: Yes, you slept through the night.
MARTHA: That's good.
LUCY: Are you going to drink the tea?
MARTHA: I don't want it. Lucy gets up and leaves.
MARTHA: We have to do something.
WATTS: He's fine. Right Max?
MAX: Yeah, I'm cool. They help him up and he falls. He cant put pressure on his leg and he seems to have a concussion.
MARTHA: Watts!
WATTS: There's nothing to do Marcy, you need to get inside. Max is strong, he'll be fine. Right?
MAX: Yeah, I'm good Marcy. Stop.
MARTHA: How long do you think we'll be down here?
ZOE: It'll just be a few days. Just to be safe.
MARTHA: Do you feel alright? If you hit your head you shouldn't sleep.
MAX: I'm fine.
MARTHA: Do you know why we're down here?
MAX: No. Do you? She shakes her head.
MARTHA: What do you think it was?
MAX: I don't know. It doesn't matter.
MARTHA: Do you still think about leaving?
MAX: No. It's cool now, I don't really have anywhere to go. Why, would you?
MARTHA: No. I just wanted to see about you.
MARTHA: Hello?
VOICE: Hi, is Watts there?
MARTHA: Who's this? There is something written on the wall Martha reads. Martha signals to a girl in the kitchen to go outside.
VOICE: Jane. Is Watts there?
MARTHA: Can I help you?
VOICE: Who's this?
MARTHA: It's Marlene Lewis. What's your last name Jane.
VOICE: Heller, sorry, do I have the right number? Martha writes JANE HELLER on a list of names on the wall. Some of them have been scratched out.
MARTHA: I don't know, do you? Watts comes inside.
MARTHA (CONT'D): It's a Jane.
WATTS: Hey. How are you? Sure, yeah, let's do it, I'll be around there on Friday. No, that was my cousin Marlene, yeah, I'll see you in a bit then. Great, I'm glad you called. Watts hangs up. He and Martha have a quiet exchange and Watts walks away.
WATTS (CONT'D): Hey. Martha just stands there quietly.
KATIE: Nothing till they're done. You know better.
MARTHA: I know. Sorry Katie.
MARTHA: What?
LUCY: Who's Katie?
MARTHA: Oh, nothing. Beat.
MARTHA (CONT'D): Lucy?
LUCY: Yeah.
MARTHA: Is this from the past or is this now?
LUCY: What?
MARTHA: I don't remember waking up this morning.
LUCY: Why don't you go sit down, I'll finish up. Lucy hands water and some pills to Martha. Martha takes the pills, walks into the other room and collapses on the couch in front of the television. Ted walks into the kitchen. Martha listens from the couch. He reaches out and holds her hand.
TED: What's going on?
LUCY: Who the fuck knows.
TED: She needs to see someone.
LUCY: I know.
TED: I'll start looking into places tomorrow. We can arrange for her to be somewhere by Wednesday.
LUCY: Places?
TED: I don't think she should stay with us anymore. We can't do anything for her when she's like this. Lucy goes back to chopping.
LUCY: I don't want to talk about it anymore.
MARTHA: Zoe?
ZOE: Yeah.
MARTHA: I can't stop feeling terrible for that poor man.
ZOE: I know. It happens though, we're never really dead or alive, we just exist, so he's still existing, but it's in a parallel time. Just don't think about it, it's in the past. Martha is upset with how cold Zoe is.
ZOE: Martha, it's me, can I come in? Martha unlocks the door for Zoe. Patrick bursts in, slams the door and corners Martha and yells at her.
PATRICK: Haven't you learned anything?
MARTHA: I have.
PATRICK: I felt like we had a connection.
MARTHA: We do!
PATRICK: That's not what you're showing me. Patrick calms down. He sits.
PATRICK (CONT'D): Maybe I asked too much from you too soon. You have potential but you're just not there yet. I'll expect less of you fro now on. Martha is upset, like a trained animal, she runs back to his side, sits next to him and rests her head on his shoulder.
MARTHA: I'm sorry. He runs his hand through her hair.
PATRICK: Shhh. It's okay. He puts his hand on the inside of her thigh.
PATRICK (CONT'D): You're my favorite, I won't lose you.
LUCY: Are you alright? Ted pushes Lucy off of him.
LUCY (CONT'D): What the fuck happened?
TED: She kicked me down the stairs. Jesus Christ, what's it going to take, Lucy. Martha starts crying, she becomes hysterical. Lucy is irate, she runs up the stairs and confronts Martha.
LUCY: You could have killed him. Martha backs away.
MARTHA: I was confused.
LUCY: About what, what are you so confused about?
MARTHA: I thought he was someone else. Lucy's anger is building.
LUCY: You thought he was someone else? What is wrong with you?
(BEAT): I'm not doing this anymore, I'm not doing this anymore. I beat myself up over you for years and I'm sick of it, I'm sick of chasing you down and worrying about you. I need to move on.
MARTHA: I'm sorry.
LUCY: You need help Martha.
MARTHA: I know.
LUCY: What happened to you? Martha shakes her head with a severe look of fear in her eyes.
LUCY (CONT'D): What happened to you?
MARTHA: I don't know. Lucy doesn't know what else to do, she can see Martha is too far gone.
LUCY: We're going to get you proper help. There is a long moment of silence.
MARTHA: Are you going to send me away?
LUCY: I don't know how to help you anymore.
MARTHA: Please don't. Please don't.
LUCY: I can't help you.
MARTHA: Please, I can't be alone, please.
LUCY: We're trying to start a family and I don't trust you to be here. Lucy walks away.
MARTHA: Lucy?
LUCY: What? Lucy stops at the bottom of the stairs.
LUCY (CONT'D): What?
MARTHA: You're going to be a terrible mother. Lucy freezes, she tries to stay calm but bursts into tears. There is a long, tense silence. Lucy dries her eyes.
LUCY: Do you have any money left? Martha shakes her head.
LUCY (CONT'D): Of course you don't.
(BEAT): We'll make sure everything is taken care of. Lucy walks away, Martha is frozen on the stairs.
LUCY: Going swimming?
MARTHA: Yeah.
LUCY: It's a bit chilly.
MARTHA: I don't mind.
LUCY: I think we both said some things last night that we didn't mean.
MARTHA: Yeah.
LUCY: We scheduled an appointment for you tomorrow morning. Martha looks into the back of the flower bed and notices footprints.
MARTHA: What's it like there?
LUCY: It looks nice. Martha turns and walks down to the water.
LUCY (CONT'D): We're heading back to the city in about an hour. You'll be ready to go?
MARTHA: Yep.
TED: Jesus Christ.
LUCY: Are you okay?
TED: Yeah.
LUCY: Fucking idiot. What was he doing? The MAN from the dock walks past the car. They almost hit him. As they drive away, Martha turns to see him get into the a brown car, start the engine and drive. The car drives behind Ted's car. Martha looks forward for a long moment, then turns back again to see that he is still there.
