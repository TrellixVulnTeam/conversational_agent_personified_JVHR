MARTHA: Is it true married people don't fuck?
LUCY: What? No! Ted walks back to the front of the boat and looks at Martha's ass as he passes. Martha is embarrassed. She stares at the Polaroid.
LUCY: Put this on.
MARTHA: You're kidding.
LUCY: Your clothes are disgusting Martha, just try it.
MARTHA: Why does it matter?
LUCY: It just feels good to put on something nice and comfortable. Martha slips on the dress and a funny pose.

MARTHA: I'm not.
ZOE: So smile then, enjoy this amazing night. It only happens once. Zoe rests her forehead against Martha's forehead. They curl up together in a very intimate way. Martha smiles. Zoe kisses her on the lips. Martha is caught off guard. She laughs. They have a second peck on the lips before closing their eyes to sleep.
