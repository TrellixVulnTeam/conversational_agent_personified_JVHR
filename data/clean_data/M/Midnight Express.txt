FIRST OFFICER: Ahhhh.Nev Yok!
SECOND OFFICER: William Hayes.
BILLY: William Hayes.
SECOND OFFICER: Vil. Vilyum.?
BILLY: Sharp SOUND OFF of FILM BEING RIPPED FROM CAMERA. He darts a look at POLICEMAN stretching the undeveloped film out. Another loud SOUND OFF, interrupting this THE DOOR flies open again and a THIRD OFFICER strides in, obviously the most important yet, because the SECOND OFFICER jumps up from the desk, and all the others immediately move down one seat in the hierarchy without a moment's hesitation. But the THIRD OFFICER strides right up to Billy, waves to the SECOND OFFICER. THE CAMERAMAN in background bubbles with enthusiasm, sliding into position. Billy is puzzled - what's going on? His arm is grabbed and he is swivelled around.
CAMERAMAN: No.. He's smiling. Make him look
FIRST OFFICER: ( running up ) Gel? Gel??
BILLY: ( trying to explain, innocent ) I forgot. I really did. ( makes ineffective gestures )

SECOND OFFICER: ( turning on First Officer, screaming ) You worthless piece of garbage, where did you learn to search a prisoner? He's been in our custody for an hour, etc.
FIRST OFFICER: ( screaming at the others ) Who searched him? Who?
BILLY: ( protesting ) That's it! That's all I have!
TEX: ( smiling, extends Billy's clothes ) I think these gentlemen have finished for the time being if you'd like to put your clothes on.
DETECTIVE: ( thickly accented English, sympathetic ) Are you afraid, Vilyum?
BILLY: No, I'm not afraid.
DETECTIVE: Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow. yes?
BILLY: ( softly, hoping ) Good. Now, where did you get the A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.

BILLY: A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.
DETECTIVE: Would you recognize him again?
BILLY: Yes. I think so.
DETECTIVE: Good. Would you go back to the Pudding Shoppe now and point him out to my men if you see him?
TEX: ( casual tone ) You decided to fly at a bad time Billy Palestinian Guerrillas all over the place blowing up planes and all.
BILLY: ( shakes his head ) Four planes in four days.but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers.and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got.
TEX: Four planes in four days.but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers.and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got.
BILLY: But didn't have heroin.
TURK: ( grins ) Well I'm not up on all that. A drug's a drug seems to me Billy ( sweating ) But it was my first time. I'm not really a smuggler, was just two Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade.

TEX: What's your father do?
BILLY: He sells insurance for Metropolitan Be tough on 'em.

BILLY: .She was on the plane.
BILLY: She didn't know anything about.I wouldn't have wanted her to.

BILLY: Jeez, she used to say I was the lucky one.
TEX: Let's hope so, Billy. Let's sure hope so.
TEX: You seem like a nice enough kid to me Billy, but try it and I'll blow your fucking brains out.
BILLY VOICE: Dear Mom and Dad. This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write. know the confusion and the pain it will cause you. And the I really thought knew what I was doing with my life. I'd hoped somehow to get out of this quickly so that you'd never know about it. But that just isn't possible now. I don't know what's going to happen. But what can I say to you? Will 'I'm sorry' make a difference? Will it ease the pain, the shame you must be feeling? Forgive
BILLY VOICE: ( continuous ) I really thought knew what I was doing with my life. I'd hoped somehow to get out of this quickly so that you'd never know about it. But that just isn't possible now. I don't know what's going to happen. But what can I say to you? Will 'I'm sorry' make a difference? Will it ease the pain, the shame you must be feeling? Forgive
BILLY: Cold. Very cold. Can I get blanket?
ZIAT: ( in English ) Mo sell.Too late. Tomorrow.
ZIAT: ( through the bars ) You be here tomorrow. "Ayi Gedjaler"( "good night" )
ZIAT: ( tugging the sheet, growls ) You, goddamn you, give me sheet. Give me!
ZIAT: You, goddamn you, give me sheet. Give me!
HAMIDOU: ( to one of the guards ) ( checking a clipboard ) Vilyum Hi-yes
GUARD: ( checking a clipboard ) Vilyum Hi-yes
HAMIDOU: ( looking at BILLY, repeating it ) Vilyum Hi-yes.
HAMIDOU: Vilyum Hi-yes It was cold. Cold! I get blanket. Blanket! Cold!
BILLY: It was cold. Cold! I get blanket. Blanket! Cold!
THWACK!: BILLY'S LEG BUCKLES, where the faluka stick has just smashed him behind the kneecap. He SCREAMS going down. BILLY looks up from the floor: HAMIDOU with his club in hand.
HAMIDOU: ( In some sort of English, smiles ) No do. No do.
VOICE: ( close, intense ) Hey man, he's gotta walk, or his feet gonna swell up worse.
2ND VOICE: ( softer, sonorous, Swedish accent ) We take him down to courtyard.
BELL: Smoke this rocket, it'll cool the
BELL: You gotta walk around some man, or your feet gonna swell up something
ERICH: BILLY nods. They rise together, bracing his shoulder. BILLY adjusting to the sensation of standing.
ERICH: How's it feel?
BILLY: ( dizzy ) About as good as it looks.
BELL: Getchmis olsun
BILLY: Olsun - "May it pass quickly." I'm Bell, Jimmy Bell. This is Erich something Swedish.
BELL: Olsun - "May it pass quickly." I'm Bell, Jimmy Bell. This is Erich something Swedish.
ERICH: ( smiling ) Just Erich.
BILLY: I'm Billy Hayes. At least I used to be.
BILLY: Looks like a cheap hotel.
BELL: Yeah. Only the room service is lousy. Come on, let me show you the tennis courts.
ERICH: ( watching Billy limp ) Feeling all right?
BILLY: ( still groggy ) Yeah. That guy who beat me? ( stops, slightly puzzled ) I feel stoned.
BELL: ( grins, interjects ) ( vague, going on ) .He had a bald skull and.
BILLY: ( vague, going on ) .He had a bald skull and.
BELL: Hamidou. Chief of the Guards. Don't fuck with him. He almost killed an Italian dude couple months ago. Bad news. He try anything with you?
BILLY: No. I don't remember.
BELL: With these fucking Turks, soon as the light goes out. I keep one hand on their feet and their feet better not grow. You'll meet Max. He got raped something bad down in Section 13. That's the pits.
THE COURTYARD: VARIOUS ANGLES The yard is 30 by 50 paces with a wall 20 feet high. Cigarette butts, orange peels crumpled news- papers, rocks, sticks, broken glass litter the place. No guards are on the walls; the only GUARDS are unarmed inanimate lumps of boredom who look as helpless as the prisoners with whom they intermingle; they have raggedy olive green uniforms and worn boots ( they make $1 a month, augmented by bribes ). On one side of the yard is a 2-story ROGUS ( cellblock ) with barred windows from which Billy and his two companions have just emerged. On the other side of the yard is another 2-story KOGUS ( the children's kogus ). The COURTYARD is colorful, almost like a bazaar, about 8O people in it - groups of exotically dressed AFRICANS, AFGHANS, ARABS, MALAYSIANS, EUROPEANS, and predominantly TURKS pacing back and forth talking in little circles, hawking wares, trading illegal currencies. Screaming Turkish STREET URCHINS 10-14 years old, share the space playing soccer and volleyball with a surprising viciousness, continually hitting each other and cursing. A bunch of them vehemently lay bets on the soccer game. Other aspects of the prison which should become evident: 1 ) NOISE - continuous, Loud. Radios, Turkish music, screaming, shouting. 2 ) CATS - all kinds, some of them pets, some stray, tolerated because they kill the rats. 3 ) THE PRISONERS all wear their own clothing; the foreigners preferring jeans, clip-clops, sneakers, Sweat suits. 4 ) THE HEADS of only the new prisoners are shaved, then allowed to grow back. 5 ) MANY PRISONERS have physical disabilities. Carbuncles on the back from wet mattresses. Boils on the lymph glands around the neck, buttocks, under-arms, sometimes SO painful the victim walks with his arms up in the air. Arthritic in the knees, hips, ankles. Fungus on the feet. Many limp. ANOTHER ANGLE - THE PRISONERS glance at BILLY as he walks, noting the beating he has taken and sizing him up, then going on with their business.
BILLY: The kids? Why are they.
BELL: ( snorts ) Little fuckers are thieves, rapists, pickpockets, murderers, you name it - they do it. Don't trust any of 'em.
BELL: ( continuous ) He was an informer on the outside but he tried to screw the cops out of 60 kilos of opium. Watch him, he's a fox.
BILLY: ( shaking his head ) History, man, history. How much?
BELL: ( shaking his head ) History, man, history. How much?
BILLY: Two kilos.
BELL: The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
BILLY: The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
BELL: ( whistling a kind of punctuation ) Could be ten or fifteen. Maybe even twenty.
BILLY: ( tensing ) Twenty months?
BELL: Twenty fucking YEARS, man - YEARS! I figger ten at the least.
BILLY: ( soft ) Yeah, what do you think this is, the good USA? This is Turkey, man. ( laughs bitterly ) ) It's a fucking accident here if you're innocent. And anyway. .ain't nobody who's innocent.
BELL: Yeah, what do you think this is, the good USA? This is Turkey, man. It's a fucking accident here if you're innocent. And anyway. .ain't nobody who's innocent.
ERICH: ( his English is halting but has a calming effect ) Don't pay too much attention, anything is possible in Turkey. You might get bail.
ERICH: .If you make bail, you're free. You can get a fake passport or sneak across the border to Greece. The Greeks hate the Turks so much they never send you back. The Turks know it. They just keep the bail. Sure, keep dreaming and see where that gets you. like Max, up in the head, you know. You gonna eat a lot more fasoulia beans, Billy baby, 'fore you taste a hamburger 'gain cause you broke the law man, and you got caught. And that. is history.
BELL: Sure, keep dreaming and see where that gets you. like Max, up in the head, you know. You gonna eat a lot more fasoulia beans, Billy baby, 'fore you taste a hamburger 'gain cause you broke the law man, and you got caught. And that. is history.
ERICH: The law is sometimes wrong.
BELL: ( eyes feverish ) The Law is never wrong, asshole. The Law is!
ERICH: New people sometimes get on his What did he do?
BILLY: ( lifeless ) What did he do?
ERIC: He was caught steeling from a Mosque. That's heavy here. He got 30 years.
BILLY: Thirty years?
ERICH: Jimmy has more balls than brains. He didn't tell his parents he was in jail for a year and a half. He says he got himself in and now he's going to get himself out.
BILLY: And you?
ERICH: Hashish. Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.
BILLY: What they give you?
ERICH: ( passive ) Twelve years.
BILLY: How much did you have?
ERICH: A hundred grams.
BILLY: ( appalled ) It's not fair!
ERICH: There is no fair in Turkey, Billy. It's all "sula-bula" like this, like that. An Italian hippie had a car accident and a Turk was killed. SO, they threw him in here for six That doesn't seem so bad.
BILLY: That doesn't seem so bad.
ERICH: But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.
BILLY: He wasn't even in the car?
ERICH: ( shakes his head ) Aslan, there. ( points ) Killed a guy. But his father's a big gangster on the docks. A "Kapidiye." He'll stay in. twelve months no more, and get parole. In Turkey, murder is manly - "erkek".
ERICH: You just got to get yourself a good lawyer. And some money. Talk to Max. He's been in the How long?
BILLY: How long?
ERICH: Seven years.
ANOTHER ANGLE: ERICH and BILLY who watches repelled as MAX fumbles with a piece of twine tied around his arm in a tourniquet, searching for an unused spot amid dirty infected track marks. PLUNGES the needle in, pumping in the black gunk. Glances at BILLY.
MAX: ( smiles ) Gastro. Stomach medicine. Has codeine in it. Best can do
ERICH: Yeah. there's no straight lawyers in Turkey. They're all bent bent as hairpins.
MAX: Yeah. there's no straight lawyers in Turkey. They're all bent bent as hairpins.
ERICH: His name?
MAX: The lawyer?
ERICH: The lawyer?
MAX: What lawyer?
ERICH: Who got the Frenchman out?
MAX: Oh Yesil. Yesil's his name but I.don't know anything.
MAX: Best way is get your ass out. any. way. you can.
BILLY: What do you mean?
MAX: Get the. midnight. express.
BILLY: What's that?
FATHER: FATHER AND SON embrace; the father's left hand grabbing Billy's arm tightly as if never to let go.
BILLY: HAMIDOU looks on, intrigued by the Father and Son; leaves silently, closing the door. FATHER looks into his son's eyes, his own eyes moistening. He looks tired, pain all over his face. BILLY looks down.
BILLY: ANOTHER ANGLE
ANOTHER ANGLE: ( voice quivering ) .Don't worry about it. ( managing a smile ) I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here. You all right?
FATHER: ( voice quivering ) .Don't worry about it. ( managing a smile ) I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here. You all right?
BILLY: ( eyes moistening ) Yeah. How's Mom?
FATHER: Bad. She couldn't make the trip. You know Her boy. Susan told us before we got your letter. She's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you, but.
BILLY: No, don't let her! I'll. How about Peg? Robbie?
FATHER: Same. None of the neighbors know. We told them you were in a hospital in Europe. Oh. this is Stanley Davis. He's the American Consul here. And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer you wanted.
ANOTHER ANGLE: ( shaking hands ) Hello, Billy.
DAVIS: ( shaking hands ) Hello, Billy.
BILLY: The professional smile from the Consul, but in the handshake and the eye contact, BILLY is cool. The unanswered question: Where were you before my father arrived?
DAVIS: I want you to know we're going to do everything, in our power to get you out as soon as possible. Believe Thank you.
BILLY: Thank you.
ANOTHER ANGLE: YESIL moves forward. unctuous. bubbling with high spirits, profusely shaking BILLY's hand, exuding confidence in fractured English,
YESIL: Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.
BILLY: Mr. Yesil.
YESIL: I know exactly what you feel but you must not worry, we are acting immediately, we get the right court, the right judge, I arrange everything - just right. And I think we get you bail. If very bad, maybe twenty month sentence. But I think we get you bail.
YESIL: ( reassuringly ) You know I have lectured at the University of Maryland in your country? Also University Michigan Very nice country. We both go back. ( smiles )
BILLY: ( trying to concentrate ) If I get bail, Mister Yesil, they say it's easy to cross the border into Greece?
FATHER: ( pacing up, hungry ) Right! That's what we're shooting for. Mister Davis and have been in contact with the State Department, but right now relations with the Turks aren't too good, Nixon's upset the hell out of them. Our best bet's. right here.
BILLY: ( pauses, glances at Davis and Yesil, embarrassed ) I'll pay you back for all this, I Don't worry about it. Right now money doesn't count. Okay?
ANOTHER ANGLE: Don't worry about it. Right now money doesn't count. Okay?
FATHER: Don't worry about it. Right now money doesn't count. Okay?
FATHER: Where'd you get that limp?
BILLY: ( not wanting to alarm him ) Nothing. Just twisted my ankle.
BILLY: Where you staying, Dad?
FATHER: ( pulls up a seat next to Billy ) The Hilton.
BILLY: How do you like it? Istanbul?
FATHER: Well, it's an interesting place. Tell you the truth, I think the food is lousy. The crap they sell in these little restaurants. I went out to eat in one of them last night, and I had to run to the damn toilet. You shoulda' seen the toilet.
BILLY: You mean you got toilets?
FATHER: Yeah, with real toilet paper - and you don't have to use both sides.
FATHER: So now I'm eating at the Hilton every night.
FATHER: Why'd you do it, Billy?
BILLY: For the money.
FATHER: ( sighs ) I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
BILLY: I know. Dad get me out of here.
BILLY: Dad get me out of here.
BILLY: PROSECUTOR VOICE ( OVER )
JUDGE: Thank you, Prosecutor. The Court will now recess to consider its
BILLY: What'd the Prosecutor say?
YESIL: ( hurried ) It's not important, just technical things. We make our case. You were very good, you spoke well. The Judge like you. It look good. Don't worry.
BILLY: ( pressing ) Did you ask for bail?
JUDGE: The Defendant has been found guilty by the Court of the illegal possession of Hashish.
JUDGE: .Therefore. this court sentences you, Vilyum Hi-yes to be imprisoned at Sagamilcar Prison for a term of four years and two months. This Case is now closed.
YESILF: Four years, two months. It's good.
FATHER: ( stunned ) Four years!
YESIL: ( quickly ) We appeal it.
YESIL: You will see, he will have maybe one year taken off this sentence for good behaviour. Remember, it is only for possession; the prosecutor wanted life sentence for smuggling. To be honest Mr. Hayes, it is a great victory!
FATHER: ( embarrassed ) .With good time Billy it works out to about 3 years. then there's the appeal. Yesil, Davis, they're all working for you We're going to try to make a deal to get you transferred to a Stateside prison. And Davis thinks there might be a political amnesty any month.
FATHER: Look - I know it sounds tough, Billy, but we're gonna get you
FATHER: .I promise you, but I don't want you to get stupid again. Pull anything. They can play with your
FATTIER: ( his voice starting to crack ) I'm putting $500 in the bank for you. Anything you need you write.
FATHER: There's food, candy, writing paper, soap, books. .cigarettes, soap, tooth-brush, there's. Jesus! I been writing insurance policies on people for thirty goddamn And now I gotta see my own son.Jesus! Jesus! If I could be where you are Billy, I'd be there. Goddamn Jesus! These bastards.
BILLY: Oh Jesus!
DAD!: Oh Jesus!
FATHER: Oh Jesus!
FATHER: You take good care of my boy, you hear, or I'll have your fucking head, you Turkish bastard!
BILLY'S VOICE: Dear Susan. 1970 has now passed into 1971. You can drift in here and never know you're gone. You can fade so far out and you don't know where you are anymore or where anything else is.
BILLY'S VOICE: ( continuous ) I find loneliness is a physical pain which hurts all over; you can't isolate it in one part of your body. I so much need your softness, your strength. I have your letters. They charge me, give me courage.News about amnesty and getting out - tangled,
VOICE: .I feel myself drifting more heavily into smoking hashish. The haze helps the time pass. Also I do soap carvings. Erich taught me. And I have been learning Turkish because it helps me to deal with the guards and the prisoners. I'm trying hard to maintain some sort of schedule to my life, but sometimes it seems like I'm just trying in order to try.
BILLY'S VOICE: ( continuous ) . In the daytimes we sometimes play volleyball against the big Turkish gangsters.
BILLY'S VOICE: .To the Turks all foreigners are "ayip" - unclean, dirty. We don't shave our under-arms or around our
BILLY VOICE: ( continuous ) Even the yoga I sometimes do is "ayip" - too suggestive.
BILLY'S VOICE: ( continuous ) And you're never supposed to eat with your left hand. You know why? Because that's what they use to wipe their asses with instead of toilet paper. And yet they hate pigs. There are no pigs in Turkey. They're considered dirty.
BILLY VOICE: ( continuous ) So is homosexuality. That's a big crime here but most of them do it every chance they get. There are about a thousand things that are "ayip". But they're really so hypocritical, like children breaking the rules. For instance.
BILLY VOICE: ( continuous ) .You can stab or shoot some body the but not above the waist because that's intent to kill. So everybody runs around stabbing everyone else in the ass. That's what they call 'Turkish revenge'. There's also a lot of "Baksheesh" that's a favorite Turkish word for bribery.
HAMIDOU: Unfortunately my youngest son Arief is having problems with his teeth; he needs braces, but dentists are so expensive these days
ASLAN: ( patting Arief on the head ) Poor kid. You know I have a friend, a very good friend; he's a dentist; maybe he could get you some braces at a. reasonable ( protesting with his hands, shaking his head ) ) Oh, no.it's out of the question.wouldn't want to ask your friend.
HAMIDOU: ( protesting with his hands, shaking his head ) ) Oh, no.it's out of the question.wouldn't want to ask your friend.
ASLAN: Yes. Please! As a favour. I insist
BILLY VOICE: ( continuous ) Hamidou hints that he needs new braces for one of his sons. Aslan of course has a friend who's a dentist. They bullshit for half an hour and Hamidou finally accepts the "Baksheesh" in return.
BILLY VOICE: ( continuous ) Dope and all kinds of shipments get delivered to Aslan, who re- sells it through his runners. People like Ziat. But one night, it
BILLY VOICE: ( continuous ) There were thousands of yellow nembutols. Aslan as usual had the privilege of going into the courtyard before anybody else to pick up his stuff but.
BILLY'S VOICE: ( continuous ) .it happened to be a new guard that day and he didn't understand the system.
GUARD: No. It's too early.
ASLAN: Open the fucking Gate, you asshole! Do you know who I am? You want to get in trouble!
GUARD: ( angry ) Hey, I your mother! Get back to your bunk.
PRISON DIRECTOR: Aslan.be reasonable. Come down and talk.
PRISON DIRECTOR: ( not moving ) Aslan. if you give up the gun, you can keep the bullets
BILLY'S VOICE: ( continuous ) A week later Aslan had a new gun.
BILLY'S VOICE: .I know all this must sound crazy to you, but this place is crazy.
BILLY: ( continuous ) Everything is "sula-bula" which means "like this, like that" - you never know what will happen. One day one of the new kids was raped in the children's kogus, so they picked out six of the worst kids.
HAMIDOU: PIS! PIS" ( "Obscene, filthy" )
HAMIDOU: You see Mamur, Mamet - what happens when you're not a good boy.
BILLY VOICE: ( continuos ) Then there's Ziat. The more I know of him.
BILLY VOICE: .the more hate him.
MAX: Ten dollars for this shit? You greedy one-eyed git.
ZIAT: NO! Is good! Me good shit.
MAX: No! You big shit! Yeah! Efe big shit.
ZIAT: Yeah! Efe big shit.
ZIAT: SHAKES THE CAT hard off his bunk. A SQUEAL from the cat. MAX surprised, glares at Ziat.
JAAAASH!: SHAKES THE CAT hard off his bunk. A SQUEAL from the cat. MAX surprised, glares at Ziat.
MAX: You asshole!
MAX: Hikmet come here boy. Hikmet
BILLY: ( irritated ) What is it with you man, what the hell is it?
ZIAT: Cat, ah! Ayip!
BILLY: You're ayip!
ZIAT: ( glares at him, then lets it go ) Look, you don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you, right?
BILLY: But you fuck with me. You fuck with me all the time. You make crummy tea. You rip us off on the I make special tea for you, Hiyes, okay? We've to live like brothers. We have to be in here together.
ZIAT: ( amused ) I make special tea for you, Hiyes, okay? We've to live like brothers. We have to be in here together.
BILLY: ( tired of it ) Oh shove it, Ziat for all the money you have, you have nothing! You 'Merican. You don't know.
ZIAT: You 'Merican. You don't know.
BILLY: Know what?
ZIAT: ( makes gesture with his fingers ) .seven years old. I was on street in Suk. Buy. Sell. No family to take care. I learn.
BILLY: Learn what?
ZIAT: Dog eat dog, Hi-yes. You fuck other man before he fuck you. And you must fuck last.
BILLY: That's a great philosophy.
ZIAT: ( shakes his head ) You 'Merican. You don't know. Here Hikmet! Come down here boy!
MAX: Here Hikmet! Come down here boy!
MAX: Sodding cat!
ANOTHER ANGLE: MAX - silently walks over and gently picks up the corpse in his arms, starts to walk out.
YESIL: ( smiling ) The new American Ambassador here is following your case very closely. He says there is progress. But there is another route that is quite possible. ( lowers his voice and leans close ) .For the proper amount of money it is possible I can convince certain officials to lose track of your papers before the High Court in Ankara confirms the sentence of the Lower Court in Istanbul. You would not exist; and you could be in Greece by the time the Turkish courts discovered a stupid clerical mistake.But I have to act before the official sentence is handed down, and for that I must pay certain officials in advance.
SUSAN'S VOICE: .My dearest Billy. I know it is long and it is hard for you, but your family and I are thinking about you all the time. I am trying hard to make enough money nights to come and see you. Your father says that lawyer Yesil wants another $2000. I know you distrust him more and more, but your father wants to do everything he can, and he is borrowing all he can on the mortgage of the house. Money seems to be the only way out of there. Except of course the other way.
SUSAN'S VOICE: ( continuous ) .But I cannot say I am for it. Nor are your parents. They consulted the priest, and he said to send you money for that reason would be like sealing your death.
BELL: ( excited ) The blueprints!
MAX: To what?
BELL: The prison, man. There was this German cat an architect in the hospital. He was helping the Turks build some shit round the place. I laid some bread on him and he let me copy them. Too bad you didn't have a machine.
ANOTHER ANGLE: MAX and BILLY, trying to follow the map, look at each other
MAX: Too bad you didn't have a machine.
BELL: ( intent ) There's two ways out I figger - over the roof, but that's only one person, maybe two. The other way is Under.
BILLY: ( grins ) It's already built! There's a basement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff, but beneath that there's these old catacombs that the Christians built 'bout a thousand fucking years ago to bury their dead. We're sitting right on top of it here. The Kraut said there's a whole bunch of hollow sealed shafts sort of like dumbwaiters running along this wall; one of them is right in there, right next to our shower. We get in there, he says, we can get down into the catacombs. With three of us working.. ( stops )

MAX: Gotta be here someplace. Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there.
ANOTHER ANGLE: ( irritated ) Stop shitting me, man!
BELL: ( irritated ) Stop shitting me, man!
BILLY: ( trying to be serious ) But how would you get into the shaft, Jimmy?
MAX: I suppose you knock three times and ask for St. Peter.
BELL: ( turning on Max ) Hey! I'm getting this together man and I don't need no fucking Gastro-head along on this trip! ( a fierce look at Max then back to Billy ) We go through the wall.
BILLY: ( a resigned look on his face ) We go through the wall?
MAX: ( quite sure Bell is out of his skull ) We go through the wall.
BELL: .The Kraut was right! I checked it out - there's no reinforced steel in those bath walls. They're real soft from underground seepage
BELL: ( gesturing profusely ) the water like "'weeps" through the cement, see. Twenty, thirty years, you can almost push it over. All we do is use Gastrohead's screwdriver here and scrape the mortar out. Pull out 2, 3 stones, squeeze through, put 'em back, and get our ass down the shaft, It's a two night operation, maybe three.
MAX: And what do you do when you in the The catacoombs? Whaddya want, a door? There's miles of em like a sewer system but they got to come up someplace in Istanbul.
BELL: The catacoombs? Whaddya want, a door? There's miles of em like a sewer system but they got to come up someplace in Istanbul.
MAX: You gotta be fucking crazy! You got stabbed in the ass once too much, sweetheart, cause you're gonna end up in Section 13, that's what - not the 'catacombs.
BILLY: Section 13?
MAX: ( looking at Bell ) Yeah, for the criminally insane. ( looks at Billy ) I was there once for two weeks and it ain't an illusion. It's awful. Namidou runs it like a death camp, that's where he spends most of his Where is it?
BILLY: Where is it?
MAX: I don' t know. It's someplace down in there.. ..deep.. A big door.a wheel..
ANOTHER ANGLE: ( low-keyed ) Hey, you know what's gonna get us out of here? It's not a map, Max. It's our balls. You know what I ( straight at Max, Billy, very sincere, his eyes almost watering ) .I gotta get laid man, I don't know 'bout you guys, but if I don't get it on soon, I'm. I'm not gonna make it.
BELL: ( low-keyed ) Hey, you know what's gonna get us out of here? It's not a map, Max. It's our balls. You know what I ( straight at Max, Billy, very sincere, his eyes almost watering ) .I gotta get laid man, I don't know 'bout you guys, but if I don't get it on soon, I'm. I'm not gonna make it.
MAX: ( under his breath ) .The roof sounds better to me than digging through a wall. Ziat's round there all the time. But the ( looks up )
BELL: .The roof sounds better to me than digging through a wall. Ziat's round there all the time. But the
BILLY: .The roof sounds better to me than digging through a wall. Ziat's round there all the time. But the
BILLY: The bullet percentage is awful
BILLY: If I get caught, Jimmy, I'm facing another months. I'd be back up to 3 years, maybe more.
BELL: Well fuck it! Choose your own death, babe, I'm taking the roof out of here!
BILLY'S VOICE: Dear Susan. Poor Jimmy was caught and beaten so badly he got a severe hernia and lost a testicle. He's been in the hospital for months having operations..
BILLY VOICE: ( continuous ) .In comparison my problems seem very small. But two and a half years have now gone by, and in their own fashion, the Turks are slowly draining my life away.
BILLY'S VOICE: .I have problems with my stomach and my leg muscles feel very weak. My gums seem to be shrinking and they sometimes bleed when I massage them. They've pulled five of my
BILLY'S VOICE: ( continuous ) .sometimes they null the wrong
BILLY VOICE: ( continuos ) .even my dreams don't seem to work any more. Because the outside doesn't seem real any more. It's not even a fantasy.because there is no fantasy.
BILLY'S VOICE: ( continuous ) Even masturbation has become boring. It teaches you, like the rest of prison life, to seal up your emotions, and this is the greatest danger, this is what makes so many of the men change into something
BILLY VOICE: ( continuous ) It is Erich who has taught me how it is to be conscious, to channel and direct my energy. He has convinced me to stop smoking hashish, he is the calmest man I have ever known. If you don't control your energy in here if can blow you apart like with Bell. And you can't waste it either. You have to weigh up every one of your actions - for and against. Too little sex, too much sex either will throw you off balance.
BILLY VOICE: ( continuously ) .he has taught me about feelings, and the need to express them. And he has taught me about love. ( continuous ) .and what love really is, beyond its physical forms.. .I think up to now I have only considered my own self, never really another.
BILLY VOICE: ( continuous ) .and what love really is, beyond its physical forms.. .I think up to now I have only considered my own self, never really another.
BILLY VOICE: .and now strange as it seems, Susan, without having seen you in so long I feel myself more inside of you than ever before. I feel your female mind. I sense you, touch you; .know you; and find myself falling more and more. in love with you.
BILLY: ( chant-like, gathering momentum ) A prison a monastery a cloister a Prison monastery cloister cave, Prison monastery cloister cave, Prison monastery cloister cave, Prison monastery cloister.
BILLY: Rises from his position.
BILLY'S VOICE: Dear Susan. Erich has been transferred to a prison back in Sweden. He has profoundly affected my life and though I am lonely without him I am calmer than ever.
BILLY'S VOICE: ( continuous ) Though I only have 53 days left, I feel I have never been so well adjusted to prison and to living as now..
BELL: Asina Covaciml. ( I stick it in his mouth )
BILLY'S VOICE: ( continuous ) .Poor Jimmy.
BILLY VOICE: ( continuous ) .Though his health is bad he still won't give up.
BILLY'S VOICE: ( continuous ) .He still talks of escape. What's wrong?
BILLY: What's wrong?
DAVIS: Sit down a moment, Billy. I'm afraid I have some bad news for
BILLY: Something happen to Dad?. Mom?
DAVIS: No. It looks like your going to have a new court.
BILLY: What do you mean?
DAVIS: The Prosecutor objected to your sentence for possession; he wanted a smuggling conviction and the High Court in Ankara reviewed it.
ANOTHER ANGLE: We've been notified that they rejected the sentence.
BILLY: We've been notified that they rejected the sentence.
DAVIS: We've been notified that they rejected the sentence.
DAVIS: ( continuing ) There were 35 judges on the High Court. Twenty eight of them voted for a life sentence.
BILLY: What do you mean LIFE FOR FOR WHAT!
FOR WHAT!: ( choking ) Billy! Please!
DAVIS: ( choking ) Billy! Please!
BILLY: FOR WHAT! FOR WHAT!
BILLY: I HAVE FIFTY THREE DAYS LEFT!
BILLY: I HAVE FIFTY THREE DAYS LEFT! .What is the crime? And what is the punishment? The answer seems to vary from place to place, and from time to time. What's legal today is suddenly illegal tomorrow cause some society says it's so; and what's illegal yesterday all of a sudden gets legal today because everybody's doing it and you can't throw everybody in jail. Well I'm not saying this is right or wrong. It's just the way things are..

Well I'm not saying this is right or wrong. It's just the way things are..
BILLY: ( continuous ) But I spent the last three and a half years of my life in your prison and I think I paid for my error and if it's your decision today to sentence me to more years, I.
BILLY: ( continuous ) But I spent the last three and a half years of my life in your prison and I think I paid for my error and if it's your decision today to sentence me to more years, I.
BILLY: ( continuous ) And I've been playing it cool and I've been good and now I'm damn tired of being good cause you people gave me the belief that I had 53 days left. You hung 53 days in front of my eyes and then you took those 53 days away, and Mister Prosecutor! I just wish you
BILLY: ( same self-mocking tone ) For a nation of pigs, it's funny you don't eat them. Fuck it, give me the sentence. Jesus forgave the bastards, but I can't. I hate you. Nation. I hate your I hate your people. And I fuck your sons and

BELL: .And besides that I fuck Allah and I fuck your Muslim mother too.
BELL: You got that, shit face? Asina.
BILLY: ( to Bell ) Cut it! No more fights.
BILLY: We're getting out of here.
BILLY'S VOICE: Dear Susan. It's taken me a long time to find out that it's got to stop somewhere. I've learned painfully not to trust the Turks, the courts, the lawyers, the Consul, the United States Government, and not even my loving parents. There is only one way out of here.. The Midnight Express.
MAX: ( in a whisper ) We're undermining the other stones!
BELL: We gotta take a chance and do that one next - Then pull out this one - Just jiggle it, scratch it out, loose nit up, it's soft real soft! It's there!
BILLY: It's there!
BELL: ANOTHER ANGLE - all THREE press their ears to the stone. A silence. The faintest whisper of WIND and dripping 'WATER - indicating a shaft of some nature. BELL looks back at BILLY.

BELL: ( persistent ) Haps, railroad, bus timetables?

ANOTHER ANGLE: Nah, just covered with batshit!
BELL: Nah, just covered with batshit!
BILLY: ( getting to his knees ) They went out over there: must be some kind of exit.
BILLY: Let's go back the other way.
BELL: ( desperate ) The fuck are we?
BILLY: What time is it?
MAX: Two thirty.
BILLY: Shit! Shit! Shit!
MAX: ( slumping to the ground ) It's a dead end. The Turks musta' sealed it up.
BELL: What the fuck we gonna do?
BILLY: We go back.
ANOTHER ANGLE: What? You gotta be joking.
MAX: What? You gotta be joking.
BILLY: ( resolute ) We go back, seal it up again, and come in tomorrow night - every night 'till we get out of here. There's gotta be a way. Those bats got out someplace. ( rises ) Now let's go. Doubletime!
MAX: You gotta have a lot of balls for
BELL: ( murmurs ) Count me out. ( to himself, shaking his head ) Who ever heard of anybody sneaking back into a fucking jail?
MAX: Yeah, what if got caught?
MAX: ( between giggles ) Who's laughing? I mean I find this terribly depressing. Can you see old Hamidou's face when he tries to figure this one out?
BILLY: ( between giggles ) We'll tell him we were checking out our escape route. We wanted to be completely sure before we tried it.
BELL: Billy, wake up! They found it!
BILLY: BILLY standing in a group of PRISONERS with BELL and MAX. He has a look of total despair on his face, as he watches. THE SINK. PRISONERS are everywhere jabbering excitedly among themselves. ZIAT is conferring with HAMIDOU as GUARDS rip out the last stone, revealing the HOLE leading to the

( plays with the thought idly, then shrugs ) If we knew where he hid it. ( waves it away ) Anyway, steal from him they'd pick up the whole prison and shake it sideways. We couldn't hide it ( head bobbing now, murmurs ) You know where it is?
MAX: ( head bobbing now, murmurs ) You know where it is?

BILLY: Max - where?
MAX: ( his mouth hanging open, eyes closed ) His radio Back of his open, radio.
MAX: That's why he never plays it.
EMPTY!: MOVE TO ZIAT. The look is as Billy expected. Horror, shock, anger, fear. ZIAT SCREAMS hysterically like old Greek widow and: BEATING HIS CHEST and tearing at his hair, ZIAT runs out of the KOGUS wailing, moaning.
GUARD: We found it!
NEGDIR: ( heavily accented English ) .He sell me tea business - everything. No the same. Ziat lose all. ( makes the gesture towards the heart and the gut, using the Arabic word ) Heart! Soul!
MAX: He never had one.
NEGDIR: Soon he go back streets Istanbul. Thousand enemy. No money.
MAX: I'll drink to that.
BILLY: Just got some news on Bell.

BILLY: Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.
MAX: ( grim ) Oh shit.
BILLY: I Guess he didn't talk.Poor
BILLY: Why the suit?
MAX: Maybe he's changing jobs.
HAMIDOU: ( opening the matchbox )
HAMIDOU: Starts to slap him around. BILLY glancing at MAX.
MAX: ( worried ) What's going on? Maybe Ziat can't pay off; Hamidou's taking it out in trade.
HAMIDOU: Where did you get this hash?
ZIAT: ( cowering, pretending fear ) From Max.
MAX: ( under his breath ) You got to be kidding.
HAMIDOU: What's happening with this hash?
MAX: I didn't sell it to him. I don't have anything to do with this,
HAMIDOU: ( leans closer ) I know your face. Where did you get the hash?

BILLY: BELL, his features distorted, being carried into an

ANOTHER ANGLE: BILLY walking down the aisle bypasses MAX int he kiyis, rolling on the floor, still screaming in Turkish.
MAX: Will you listen to me? PLEASE LISTEN
TO ME!: Several LUNATICS are gathered around tormenting him, one of them yanking on his penis as if it were made of rubber; another is playing with his ass. A third one, also in a leather kiyis, is leaning over MAX jabbering and drooling into his face. MAX, more enraged by this than the other bodily offences, lunges up sharply and bites the man's FACE. SCREAMS, etc. BILLY, paying no attention except for a brief disinterested glance, keeps going into: A SECOND ROOM. MORE LUNATICS. A screaming OLD MAN is chasing after another OLD MAN who has stolen his tespe beads, waving them back at the first old man who howls with rage, frantic to have his beads back. The second old man throws the beads to a THIRD OLD MAN who hops across the beds with the FIRST OLD MAN chasing him. BILLY A LITTLE NERVOUS MAN stares into a broken pocket mirror fingering the large round carbuncle under his eye, trying to rub it away with little grimaces and flurries of nervous TWO ATTENDANTS in smocks indifferently finish eating on a newspaper spread across one of the beds; they shake out the paper. CHICKEN BONES, ORANGE PEELS hitting the floor. A flurry of movement, as the LUNATICS scuffle like rats over the left- overs. AD LIB curses, yells. AN OLD MAN obscenely gestures to BILLY from his bed.
OLD MAN: ( pleading ) Allah! Allah! Yok! Yok! Yok!
OLD MAN: Hey American. Fik! Fick! Come. Fik! Fik!
AHMET: You're an American?
AHMET: Ah yes, America! My name is Ahmet. I studied philosophy at Harvard for many many years. But actually Oxford is my real Alma Mata - I've also studied in Vienna. Now I study here.

AHMET: They won't let YOU go either.
AHMET: No, they'll never let you go. They tell you they let you go but you stay. You never go from here.
AHMET: You see we all come from a factory. Sometimes the factory makes bad machines that don't work. They put them here. The bad machines don't know they're bad machines, but the people at the factory know. They know one of the machines that doesn't work.

SUSAN: Billy, what have they done to you.my God!
SUSAN: .Billy, your family is fine. Senator Buckley just made a special plea on your behalf in the Senate. Newsday has written several big articles about you. They've called you a pawn in the poppy game between Nixon and the Turks. The letters are coming in, Billy. People

ATTENDANT: Let's go!
SUSAN: ( quickly ) If you stay you'll die Billy! Get out of here. Get to Greece, you hear me?.Billy?
ANOTHER ANGLE: BILLY, on the inner track, passes TWO LUNATICS who are walking counter-clockwise. They glare at him, motion for him to turn around. Billy just keeps walking. BILLY intersects several more LUNATICS going counter- clockwise They motion for him to turn.
LUNATIC: ( grunting )
AHMET: Good morning, my American friend! There will be trouble if you go this way. A good Turk always walks to the right. Left is communist. Right is good. You must go the other way. It's Good.
AHMET: Why you go? Why don't you walk the wheel with us? The bad machine doesn't know he's a bad machine. You still don't believe it? You still don't believe you're a bad machine?
ANOTHER ANGLE: BILLY stops and turns to look at AHMET at the base of the STAIRS. BILLY carries on up the stairs.
AHMET: ( shakes his head ) To know oneself is to know God, my friend. The factory knows. That's why they put you here. You'll see. You'll find out. Later on you'll
BILLY: I already know. I know that you're a bad machine. That's why the factory keeps you here. You know how I know? I know because I'm from the factory. I make the machines.. I'm here to spy on you.
ATTENDANT: Hop! Hop! Take!
BILLY: THE LUNATICS, petrified, scatter off but ONE LUNATIC skids in a puddle of urine and crashes onto the tile howling. BILLY slits open the binder to reveal TEN HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS with Pictures of Mr. Franklin' neatly inserted.
ANOTHER ANGLE: BILLY has no particular expression on his face. Reflective, staring at the money; he looks up. A LARGE SILHOUETTE is moving towards him. BILLY just watches, transfixed, not trying to hide the HAMIDOU comes into a faint light, looking down at him; glances at the money. Shakes his head gently.
HAMIDOU: No do! No do!
HAMIDOU: ( in his broken English ) I tell you I see 'gain. ( into Turkish ) I take you down to bath and your feet be big like.Breasts ( a gesture )
HAMIDO: First you make mistake with Ziat, now you make mistake with money. You're not a new Prisoner, Vilyum
HAMIDOU: ( shakes his head ) You've been in prison too long, Vilyum Hi-yes.
