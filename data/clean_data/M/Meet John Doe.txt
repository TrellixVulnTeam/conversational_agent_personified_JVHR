CONNELL: ( on phone )
ANN: ( supplicatingly )
SECRETARY: More good luck telegrams.
ANN: Well, you know how it is, I, I've just got to keep working. See?
CONNELL: Sorry, sister. I was sent down here to clean house. I told yuh I can't use your column any more. It's lavender and old lace![1]
MATTIE: ( over dictograph )
CONNELL: Send those other people in.
MATTIE: ( over dictograph )
ANN: I'll tell you what I'll do. I get thirty dollars a week. I'll take twenty-five, twenty if necessary. I'll do anything you say.
CONNELL: It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammersstart arguments.
ANN: Oh, I can do that. I know this town inside out. Oh, give me a chance, please.
CONNELL: All right, come in, come in! Come in!
CONNELL: Don't forget to get out your last column before you pick up your check!
JOE: You're a couple o' sticks[2] shy in your column, Ann.
ANN: ( ignores him, muttering . . . )
JOE: Did you get it, too?
ANN: Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
JOE: Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column.
ANN: Yeah. Lavender and old lace!
ANN: Wait, Joewait!
ANN: ( muttering )
ANN: As JOE takes it, ANN begins to empty the drawers of her desk.
JOE: ( reading )
JOE: ( continues reading )
JOE: Hey, Ann, this is the old fakeroo, isn't Full shot: ANN has just about accumulated all her things. JOE stares at her, knowing it's a fake.
ANN: Never mind that, Joe. Go ahead.
MAN: ( reading newspaper )
2ND MAN: Why Jim, it's just a letter sent in to a column.
JIM: No, no. I can smell it. That's Norton!
GOVERNOR: Good morning, gentlemen. You're rather 'Morning. 'Morning, Governor.
MEN: 'Morning. 'Morning, Governor.
GOVERNOR: You're here rather early.
JIM: ( pushes paper over to him )
GOVERNOR: Yes. I had it served with my breakfast this morning.
2ND MAN: Jim thinks it's D. B. Norton at work.
JIM: Of course it is!
GOVERNOR: Oh, come, Jim. That little item? D. B. Norton does things in a much bigger way . . .
JIM: This is his opening attack on you, Governor! Take my word for it! What did he buy a paper for? Why did he hire a high-pressure editor like Connell for? He's in the oil business! I tell you, Governor, he's after your scalp!
GOVERNOR: All right, Jim. Don't burst a blood vessel, I'll attend to it.
SPENCER: Yes. Yes. I saw it, Governor . . . and if you ask me that's a phoney letter. Why, that gag has got whiskers on it. Huh? Okay, I'll get the Mayor and maybe the Chamber of Commerce to go after ( into dictagraph )
SECRETARY: ( picking up phone )
MAYOR: ( into telephone )
SECRETARY: Spencer of the Chronicle .
MAYOR: Hold him.
MRS. BREWSTER: I insist that this John Doe man be found and given a job at once. If something isn't done. I'll call out the whole Auxiliary[3] yes, and the Junior Auxiliary, too. We'll hold a meeting and see
MAYOR: Yes, Spencer. Who? The Governor? Well, what about me? it's my building he's jumping off of! And I'm up for re-election, ( to Secretary )
SECRETARY: ( to Secretary )
MAYOR: ( to Secretary )
SECRETARY: Out the window! Something just flew I didn't see anything.
MAYOR: Out the window! Something just flew I didn't see anything.
SECRETARY: I didn't see anything.
MAYOR: ( semi-hysterical )
MAYOR: Is there a crowd in the street?
SECRETARY: No, sir.
MAYOR: Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look I think it must have been a sea-gull.
SECRETARY: I think it must have been a sea-gull.
MAYOR: A sea-gull? What's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? That's a bad omen, isn't it?
SECRETARY: Oh, n-no, sir. The sea-gull is a lovely ( into telephone )
MAYOR: ( into telephone )
MAYOR: ( into Spencer's phone )
MAYOR: Hello! Connell! This is
CONNELL: Yes, Mayor Lovett! How many times are you gonna call me? I've got everybody and his brother and sister out looking for him. Did you see the box I'm running?
CONNELL: ( reading )
BEANY: I went up to Miss Mitchell's house, boss. Boy, she's in a bad way.
CONNELL: Where is she?
BEANY: Hey, do you know something? She supports a mother and two kids. What do you know about that?
CONNELL: ( controlling his patience )
BEANY: No. Her mother's awful worried about her. When she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. Er, the girl, I mean!
CONNELL: ( barking )
BEANY: Sure. Hey, but the biggest thing I didn't tell you . . .
CONNELL: Hello! . . . Yeh?
BEANY: Her old man was Doc Mitchell. You know, the doc that saved my mother's life and wouldn't take any money for it? You remember that? Okay, boss, I'll go and look for her.
CONNELL: ( into phone )
CONNELL: ( into phonestaring at Ann )
ANN: ( innocently )
CONNELL: ( quietlysizzling )
ANN: I remember, distinctly, being fired.
CONNELL: That's right. But you have a piece of property that still belongs to this newspaper. And I'd like to have it!
ANN: What's that?
CONNELL: The letter.
ANN: What letter?
CONNELL: The letter from John Doe.
ANN: The whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only ( simply )
CONNELL: The whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only ( simply )
ANN: ( simply )
CONNELL: We'll get a handwriting expert to
ANN: There is no letter.
CONNELL: Say that again.
ANN: There is no letter. I made it up.
CONNELL: ( repeating dully )
ANN: Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.
CONNELL: Don't you know there are nine jobs waiting for this guy? Twenty-two families want to board him free? Five women want to marry him, and the Mayor's practically ready to adopt him? And you . . .
BEANY: I just called the morgue, boss. They say there's a girl there
CONNELL: Shut up!
BEANY: Ann! Say, why didn't yuh
CONNELL: Med. shot: At the door. The painter is beginning to grind his teeth. He pulls the door shut, viciously.
POP: Only one thing to do, Hank. Drop the whole business quickly.
CONNELL: Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and
POP: Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and
CONNELL: ( jumps in quickly )
NED'S VOICE: I got a story I want yuh to
CONNELL: I got a story I want yuh to
ANN: Wait a minute!
ANN: Listen, you great big wonderful genius of a newspaperman! You came down here to shoot some life into this dying paper, didn't you?
ANN: Well, the whole town's curious about John Doe and, boom, just like that you're going to bury him. There's enough circulation in that man to start a shortage in the ink market!
CONNELL: ( thoroughly bewildered )
ANN: John Doe.
CONNELL: What John Doe?
ANN: Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doeand he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!
CONNELL: A deal?
ANN: Sure! When you get hold of a stunt that sells papers you don't drop it like a hot potato. Why, this is good for at least a couple of months. You know what I'd do? Between now and let's say, Christmas, when he's gonna jump, I'd run a daily yarn starting with his boyhood, his schooling, his first job! A wide-eyed youngster facing a chaotic world. The problem of the average man, of all the John Does in the world.
ANN: Now, then comes the drama. He meets discouragement. He finds the world has feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So what does he do? He decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization. He thinks of the river! But no, no, he has a better idea. The City Hall. Why? Because he wants to attract attention. He wants to get a few things off his chest, and that's the only way he can get himself heard.
CONNELL: Full shot: Of the whole group. BEANY grins in admiration. CONNELL has leaned back in his chair, his eyes glued on
ANN: So! So he writes me a letter and I dig him up. He pours out his soul to me, and from now on we quote: "I protest, by John Doe." He protests against all the evils in the world; the greed, the lust, the hate, the fear, all of man's inhumanity to man.
CONNELL: ( after a pausequietly )
ANN: John Doe.
CONNELL: ( loses controlscreams )
ANN: ( screams right back )
CONNELL: ( breaking silencespeaks with a controlled patience )
ANN: ( nodding )
CONNELL: Who, for instance?
ANN: Anybody! Er, erBeany'll do!
BEANY: Why sureWho? Me? Jump off aOh, no! Any time but Christmas. I'm superstitious.
CONNELL: ( sighing )
POP: Better get that story in, Hank, it's getting late.
ANN: ( to CONNELL )
CONNELL: Holy smokes! Wasting my time listening to this mad woman.
NED: Look, Chief! Look what the Chronicle is running on John Doe. They say it's a fake!
CONNELL: Why, the no-goodlow-down
ANN: That's fine! That's fine! Now fall right into their laps. Go ahead. Say John Doe walked in and called the whole thing off. You know what that's going to sound like on top of this!
CONNELL: ( doesn't like Ned hearing all this )
NED: All right.
CONNELL: ( fighting spirit )
BEANY: Hey, boss. Get a load of this.
CONNELL: ( joins him in the doorway )
BEANY: Med. shot: Over their shoulders. In the outer office are a large group of derelict-looking men. Some standingsome sittingsome leaning. It looks like the lobby of a flophouse had been transplanted.
CONNELL: What do they want?
BEANY: They all say they wrote the John Doe Med. shot: POP and ANN have walked over and also peer out.
CONNELL: ( amused, turns )
ANN: Tell them all to wait.
ANN: Look, Mr. Connellone of those men is your John Doe. They're desperate and will do anything for a cup of coffee. Pick one out and you can make the Chronicle eat their words.
CONNELL: I'm beginning to like this.
POP: If you ask me, Hank, you're playing around with dynamite.
CONNELL: No, no, no, the gal's right. We can't let the Chronicle get the laugh on us! We've got to produce a John Doe now.
ANN: Sureand there's no reason for them to find out the truth, either.
CONNELL: ( grinning )
ANN: Plus a bonus.
CONNELL: What bonus?
ANN: ( tries to drop it casually )
CONNELL: I can read. I can read!
ANN: She backs away. CONNELL continues reading her confession.
CONNELL: So you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you?
ANN: ( very carelessly )
CONNELL: Packs everything, including a gun.
POP: Show me an American who can keep his mouth shut andI'll eat him.
CONNELL: ( opens door )
CONNELL: Did you write that letter to Miss Mitchell?
TALL CHAP: ( after a pause )
CONNELL: What are you doing up here then?
TALL CHAP: Well, the paper said there were some jobs around loose. Thought there might be one left over.
ANN: Had any schooling?
TALL CHAP: Yeah, a little.
ANN: What do you do when you work?
TALL CHAP: ( slight pause )
ANN: TALL CHAP Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
TALL CHAP: Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
ANN: Where'd you play?
TALL CHAP: Bush leagues mostly.[5]
CONNELL: How about family? Got any family?
TALL CHAP: ( after a pause )
CONNELL: Oh, just traveling through, huh?
TALL CHAP: Yeah. Me and a friend of mine. He's ? 596 ? CONNELL nods to the others to join him in a huddle. He crosses to a corner. They follow.
CONNELL: Looks all right
ANN: He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
CONNELL: I wish he had a family, though.
POP: Be less complicated without a family.
ANN: Look at that face. It's wonderful. They'll believe him . Come on.
CONNELL: What's your name?
TALL CHAP: Willoughby. John Willoughby, Long John Willoughby they called me in baseball.
ANN: Er, would you, er, would you like to make some money?
JOHN: Yeah, maybe.
ANN: Would you be willing to say you wrote that letterand stick by it?
JOHN: Oh, I get the idea. Yeah, maybe.
ANN: That's our man. He's made to order.
CONNELL: I don't know. He don't seem like a guy that'd fall into line.
ANN: ( it's significant to her )
ANN: He's fainted! Get some water quickly!
CONNELL: Hurry up, Pop.
ANN: ( to John )
CONNELL: ( to John )
JOHN: Are you all right?
ANN: Are you all right?
JOHN: Yeah, I'm all right.
ANN: How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
COLONEL: Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
ANN: Well, nobody asked yuh.
COLONEL: Trying to improve the world by jumping off buildings. You couldn't improve the world if the building jumped on ( to Ann )
JOHN: ( to Ann )
ANN: He likes you well enough to stick around.
JOHN: Oh, that's 'cause we both play doohickies.[6] I met him in a box car a couple o' years ago. I was foolin' around with my harmonica and he comes over and joins in. I haven't been able to shake him since.
CONNELL: All right, boys, here he is.
ANN: ( jumping up )
CONNELL: But, he's gonna jump off a building!
ANN: Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
CONNELL: Well, maybe you're right.
ANN: We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel roomunder bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him.
CONNELL: ( nods )
ANN: Oh, swell! Is that the contract?
CONNELL: ( sees the COLONEL )
ANN: Friend of his. They play duets together.
CONNELL: Duets? But can we trust him?
ANN: I trust him.
JOHN: I trust him.
CONNELL: Oh, you trust him, eh? Well, that's fine. I suppose he trusts you, too?
ANN: Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.
COLONEL: ( insulted )
CONNELL: Well, okay. But we don't want more than a couple o' hundred people in on this thing. Now the first thing I want is an exact copy of the John Doe letter in your own handwriting.
ANN: I got it all ready. Here.
CONNELL: Well, that's fine. Now I want you to sign this agreement. It gives us an exclusive story under your name day by day from now until Christmas. On December twenty-sixth, you get one railroad ticket out of town, and the Bulletin agrees to pay to have your arm fixed. That's what you want, isn't it?
JOHN: Yeah, but it's got to be by Bone-Setter Okay, Bone-Setter Brown goes. Here, sign it. Meanwhile, here's fifty dollars for spending money. That's fine. Beany!
CONNELL: Okay, Bone-Setter Brown goes. Here, sign it. Meanwhile, here's fifty dollars for spending money. That's fine. Beany!
BEANY: Yeah, Boss?
CONNELL: Take charge of him. Get him a suite at the Imperial and hire some bodyguards.
ANN: Yeah, and some new clothes, Beany.
BEANY: Do you think we better have him de-loused?
CONNELL: Yeh, yeh, yeh.
BEANY: Both of 'em?
CONNELL: Yes, both of 'em! But don't let him out of your sight.
ANN: Hey, Beany, gray suit, huh?
BEANY: Okay, fellows.
CONNELL: Okay, fellows.
ANN: Take it easy, John Doe.
CONNELL: ( turns to Ann )
ANN: ( interrupting )
CONNELL: ( grimaces )
BEANY: Okay, fellas.
BEANY: Now, lemme see. You sit outside the door. Nobody comes in, see. You two fellas sit in here.
JOHN: Hey, pretty nifty, huh?
COLONEL: You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
JOHN: Sure, you are.
COLONEL: No, sir. That spot under the bridge where we slept last night's good enough for me.
BELL HOP: Hey, what'll I do with this baggage?
BEANY: Aw, stick 'em in the bedroom.
COLONEL: Gimme mine. I ain't staying! You know we were headed for the Columbia River country before all this John Doe business came up. You remember that, don't yuh?
JOHN: Sure. I remember . . . Say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator? Mine did.
COLONEL: Aw, Long John . . . I tell youit's no good. You're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither!
JOHN: Stop worrying, Colonel. I'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this.
BEANY: Here's some cigars the boss sent up. Have one.
JOHN: Hey, cigars!
BEANY: ( to Colonel )
COLONEL: JOHN flops into a luxurious chairand immediately ANGELFACE holds a light up for his cigar. JOHN looks up, pleased.
JOHN: Say, I'll bet yuh even the Major Leaguers don't rate an outfit like this.
ANGELFACE: ( hands him a newspaper )
COLONEL: ( sharply )
COLONEL: ( crosses to John )
BEANY: Hey, did yuh get a load of the bedroom?
JOHN: BEANY beckons to him to follow, which JOHN does with great interest.
COLONEL: ( in doorway )
COLONEL: The next thing the dope wants is a room. Yessir, a room with steam heat! And curtains and rugs
JOHN: ( as he goes )
COLONEL: I seen plenty of fellers start out with fifty bucks and wind up with a bank ( can't stand it any more )
BEANY: ( can't stand it any more )
COLONEL: ( ignoring him )
BEANY: Who's got him?
COLONEL: The heelots!
BEANY: ( at the window )
JOHN: ( at the window )
BEANY: Who's got him?
COLONEL: The heelots!
JOHN: At the same time BEANY springs to his side and yanks him back.
BEANY: Hey, wait a minute! You ain't supposed to do that till Christmas Eve! Wanta get me in a jam?
JOHN: ( twinkle in his eye )
COLONEL: And when they get you, you got no more chance than a road-rabbit.
BEANY: ( dogging the COLONEL )
JOHN: Say, is this one of those places where you ring if you want something?
BEANY: Yeah. Just use the phone.
JOHN: Boy! I've always wanted to do this!
BEANY: Hey, Doc, look. Look, Doc. Gimme that again, will yuh? Who's gonna get him?
COLONEL: The heelots!
BEANY: Who are they?
COLONEL: Listen, sucker, yuh ever been broke?
BEANY: Sure. Mostly often.
COLONEL: All right. You're walking alongnot a nickel in your jeansfree as the windnobody bothers youhundreds of people pass yuh by in every line of businessshoes, hats, automobiles, radio, furniture, everything. They're all nice, lovable people, and they let you alone. Is that Close-up: Of BEANYnodding his head, ? 605 ? COLONEL'S VOICE Then you get hold of some dough, and what happens?
COLONEL'S VOICE: Then you get hold of some dough, and what happens?
COLONEL: All those nice, sweet, lovable people become heelots. A lotta heels.
COLONEL: Now your whole life is messed up with more stufflicense feesand number platesand gas and oiland taxes and insurance
COLONEL'S VOICE: . . . and identification cardsand lettersand billsand flat tiresand dentsand traffic tickets and motorcycle cops and court roomsand lawyersand Wider shot: The LUG steps up directly behind BEANYand the two horrified faces are close togetherboth staring at the
COLONEL: And a million and one other things. And what happens? You're not the free and happy guy you used to be. You gotta have money to pay for all those thingsso you go after what the other feller's ( with finality )
JOHN: ( smiling )
COLONEL: ( as he goes )
ANGELFACE: ( aghast )
JOHN: ( calling )
ANGELFACE: Say, he's giving it away! I'm gonna get me some of that!
BEANY: Hey, come back here, yuh heelot!
JOHN: ( on the phone )
ANN: Hello there. Well, well! If it isn't the man about town!
EDDIE: All set, Ann?
ANN: ( coming out of it )
JOHN: JOHN winds up in pitching posehis left leg lifted up high.
ANN: JOHN winds up in pitching posehis left leg lifted up high.
EDDIE: That's good.
ANN: No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
EDDIE: ? 607 ? Here. Wait a minute. Let me comb your hair. Sit down. There. That's better.
ANN: Here. Wait a minute. Let me comb your hair. Sit down. There. That's better.
ANN: You know, he's got a nice face, hasn't Yehhe's pretty.
ANGELFACE: Yehhe's pretty.
ANN: Here. Sit down!
JOHN: ( laughing )
ANN: Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization.
JOHN: With all of it?
ANN: Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.
JOHN: Oh, crabby guy, huh?
ANN: Yeah. No, no!
JOHN: Well, all those guys in the bleachers Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
ANN: Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
JOHN: Against what?
ANN: Against anything. Just protest.
JOHN: ( laughing )
ANN: Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?
JOHN: ( advances toward her )
ANN: Why can't you call right, you bone-headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot-bellied
JOHN: Why can't you call right, you bone-headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot-bellied
ANN: Grab it, Eddie, grab it!
GOVERNOR: I don't care whose picture they're publishing. I still say that this John Doe person is a myth. And you can quote me on that. And I'm going to insist on his being produced for questioning. You know as well as I do that this whole thing is being engineered by a vicious man with a vicious purposeMr. D. B. Norton.
GROOM: Mr. Connell and Miss Mitchell are at the house, sir.
ANN: ( as they walk )
ANN: You should see his fan mail! Thousands! Why, it's going over like a house afire!
CONNELL: Yeah, but it's got everybody sore. Ads are being pulledthe Governor's starting a libel suitwhat's more, they all know John Doe's a phoneyand they insist on seeing him.
ANN: Well, what about it? Let them see him! We'll go them one better. They can also hear him.
CONNELL'S VOICE: Watch out for this dame, D. B. She'll drive you batty!
ANN: ? 610 ? Wider shot: To include all three.
CONNELL: Look. We can't let 'em get to this bush-league pitcher and start pumping him. Good night! No telling what that screwball might do. I walked in yesterdayhere he is, standing on a table with a fishing pole flycasting. Take my advice and get him out of town before this thing explodes in our faces!
ANN: If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse ( to Annhotly )
CONNELL: ( to Annhotly )
ANN: Sure, it's a meal ticket for me. I admit it, but it's also a windfall for somebody like Mr. Norton who's trying to crash national politics.
ANN: All right, let's not forget the Governor, the Mayor and all small fry like that. This can arouse national interest! If he made a hit around herehe can do it everywhere else in the country! And you'll be pulling the strings, Mr. Norton!
CONNELL: ( protesting )
CONNELL: ( shrugging )
ANN: Yes, sir.
ANN: Thirty dollars.
ANN: D. B. ( laughs )
ANN: Oh, I'm sure I can.
ANN: A hundred dollars!
ANN: How do you do.
TED: How do you do!
TED: Always reading my mind, aren't you?
ANN: ( laughing )
ANN: Yes, sir.
ANN: Oh! Hey! Oh, hey! I thought you were We just wanted to say good night, Sis.
ELLEN: We just wanted to say good night, Sis.
ANN: Oh, oh! Oh, you little brats! You're just stalling. I said good night!
MOTHER: ( above the din )
ELLEN: Oh, all right.
MOTHER: Go on!
ELLEN: Come on, Pooch! Come on, come on.
MOTHER: Now, keep Pooch off the bed.
ANN: Stick a fork through me! I'm done. I'll never get this speech right.
MOTHER: Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
ANN: Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
MOTHER: Your purse. I need ten dollars.
ANN: What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
MOTHER: Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the houseand then this morning the Community Chest[7] lady came around and
ANN: And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
MOTHER: The Websters.
ANN: The Websters!
MOTHER: You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor
ANN: You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
MOTHER: Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty If you're thinking of that thousand dollars, forget it. It's practically gone. We owed everybody in town. Now, you've just gotta stop giving all your money away.
ANN: If you're thinking of that thousand dollars, forget it. It's practically gone. We owed everybody in town. Now, you've just gotta stop giving all your money away.
MRS. MITCHELL: Oh, Ann, dear!
ANN: Oh, I'm sorry, Ma. Oh, don't pay any attention to me. I guess I'm just upset about all this. Gee whiz, here I am with a great opportunity to get somewhere, to give us security for once in our lives, and I'm stuck. If I could put this over, your Mrs. Burke can have six babies!
MOTHER: Do you mean the speech you're writing?
ANN: Yeah, I don't know. I simply can't get it to jell! I created somebody who's gonna give up his life for a principle, hundreds of thousands of people are gonna listen to him over the radio and, unless he says something that's, well, that's sensational, it's just no good!
MOTHER: Well, honey, of course I don't know what kind of a speech you're trying to write, but judging from the samples I've read, I don't think anybody'll Darling, there are so many complaining political speeches. People are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio. If you're going to have him say anything, why don't you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in it? If your father were alive, he'd know what to say.

ANN: Oh, yes, Father certainly would.
MOTHER: Wait a minute . . .
ANN: MRS. MITCHELL crosses to a desk, finds a key and unlocks a compartment. ANN watches her, curiously.
MOTHER: That's your father's diary, Ann.
ANN: Father's . . . I never knew he had a There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear? It's always helped keep your father alive for me.

LUG: Wait a minute. John Doe don't wanta sign no autographs.
INQUIRER: Well, what does he do all day?
LUG: What does he do all day? He's writin' out his memories!
BEANY: Sorry, lady. you can't see Mr. Doe. He wants to be alone. No, no, he just sits around all day and commutes with Camera swings around to JOHN. He stands in the middle of the floor, his pitcher's glove on, playing an imaginary game of ball. He winds up and throws an imaginary Close-up: Of the COLONEL. He wears a catcher's mittand smacks it as if he just caught the ball.
BEANY: ( umpiring )
COLONEL: I don't know how you're gonna stand it around here till after Christmas.
COLONEL: ( as he steps back behind the plate )
BEANY: I know why you're hangin' aroundyou're stuck on a girlthat's all a guy needs is to get hooked up with a woman.
COLONEL: I know why you're hangin' aroundyou're stuck on a girlthat's all a guy needs is to get hooked up with a woman.
ANGELFACE: ( seriously )
JOHN: ( explaining )
ANGELFACE: ( shouting at "firstbaseman" )
COLONEL: When a guy has a woman on his handsthe first thing he knows his life is balled up with a lot more thingsfurniture Close shot: Of JOHN. He catches the "ball"gets into positionnods to his catcherraises his hands in the air, takes a peek toward first baseand suddenly wheels around facing camera, and whips the "ball" toward first base. Almost immediately his face lights up.
ANGELFACE: Did you get him?
BEANY: ( umpiring )
ANGELFACE: That's swell! What's thisthe end of the eighth?
JOHN: He steps into the "pitcher's box".
LUG: Hey, Beany! There's a coupla lugs from the Chronicle snooping around out here!
BEANY: Come on, Angelface! Gangway!
LUG: What's the score, Angelface?
ANGELFACE: Three to twoour favor.
LUG: Gee, that's great!
MIKE: You've got swell form. Must have been a pretty good pitcher.
JOHN: Pretty good? Say, I was just about ready for the major leagues when I chipped a bone in my elbow. I got it pitchin' a nineteen-inning game!
MIKE: Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what? I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up.
JOHN: Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what? I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up.
MIKE: ( picks up newspapersighing )
JOHN: What do you mean, too bad?
MIKE: ( pretending distraction )
JOHN: Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get a
MIKE: ( interrupting carelessly )
JOHN: ( walking over )
MIKE: Well, I was just thinking about this John Doe business. Why, as soon as it comes out it's all a fake, you'll be washed up in baseball, won't you?
JOHN: Y-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought about that. Gosh!
MIKE: And another thing, what about all the kids in the country, the kids that idolize ball players? What are they gonna think about you?
JOHN'S VOICE: Hey, did you hear that, Colonel?
JOHN: I gotta figure some way out of this The elevators are still runnin'.
COLONEL: The elevators are still runnin'.
MIKE: ( carelessly )
JOHN: Well, when you get up on the radio, all you have to do is say the whole thing's a frame-up. Make you a hero sure as you're born!
MIKE: Well, when you get up on the radio, all you have to do is say the whole thing's a frame-up. Make you a hero sure as you're born!
JOHN: Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth.
MIKE: Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth.
COLONEL: ( eyes popping )
MIKE: Yeah. Five thousand dollars. And he gets it right away. You don't have to wait till Christmas.
COLONEL: Look out, Long John! They're closing in on you!
JOHN: ( ignores COLONEL )
MIKE: Feller runs the Chronicle .
COLONEL: ( eyes heaven-ward )
MIKE: It's on the level.
1ST GIRL: No, I'm sorry. Tickets for the broadcast are all gone. Phone the Bulletin.
2ND GIRL: Sorry. No more tickets left.
BEANY: Here he is.
ANN: Hello, John. All set for the big night? Turn around.
PHOTOGRAPHER: Turn around.
2ND PHOTOGRAPHER: One momenthold it! Now stand still, Mr. Doe.
ANN: Okay, Beany, take them outside.
ANN: Now, look, John. Here's the speech. It's in caps and double-spaced. You won't have any trouble reading it. Not nervous, are you?
JOHN: Of course not. He wouldn't be.
ANN: Of course not. He wouldn't be.
JOHN: John Doe. The one in there.
ANN: John Doe. The one in there.
BEANY: Hey, don't let your knees rattle. It picks up on the mike!
ANN: Oh, Beany! You needn't be nervous, John. All you have to remember is to be sincere.
MAN: Pick up the phone, Miss Mitchell. It's for you.
ANN: ( takes phone )
MRS. BREWSTER: Oh, there he is, the poor, dear man! Oh, good luck to you, Mr. Doe. We want you to know that we're all for you. The girls all decided that you're not to jump off any roof a'tall. Oh, we'll stop it!
ANN: Sorry, ladies. Mr. Doe can't be bothered now. He's gotta make a speech out there, While she gets them outMIKE slips into the room.
MIKE: Have you got the speech I gave you?
JOHN: ( taps breast pocket )
MIKE: Now, look. I'll give this money to the Colonel just as soon as you get started. We'll have a car waiting at the side entrance for you.
JOHN: Full shot: ANN turns away from the door.
ANN: ( to MIKE )
MIKE: Huh? Oh, I just came in to wish him Come on, out. Out!
ANN: Come on, out. Out!
JOHN: John Doe, the one in the speech.
ANN: John Doe, the one in the speech.
JOHN: Oh. Yeah.
ANN: You know something? I've actually fallen in love with him.
CONNELL: All right, there he is, sister. Now, come onplenty of oomph!
ANN: What's the idea?
CONNELL: No, no, no. Now that's too much!
PHOTOGRAPHER: One moment, please.
ANN: This is no time for cheap publicity, Mr. Connell!
CONNELL: Listen. If that guy lays an egg. I want to get something out of it. I'm getting a Jane Doe ready!
ANN: ( trying to get rid of them )
PHOTOGRAPHER: All right. I need one more.
ANN: Go right ahead.
COLONEL: How're you doin'?
CONNELL: ( calls to Beany outside )
COLONEL: Holy smoke! A half a heelot!
BEANY: There you are, Boss, just like you ordered. Symbols of the little people.
CONNELL: Okay. Get them up.
ANN: This is ridiculous, Mr. Connell! Come on, give him a chance. The man's on the air!
BOY MIDGET: ( to girl midget )
GIRL MIDGET: ( coquettishly )
STAGE MANAGER: Better get ready. One minute to go!
ANN: Wow! One minute to go, and the score is nothing to nothing! Now, please, John, you won't let me down, will you? Will you? 'Course you won't. If you'll just think of yourself as the real John Listen. Everything in that speech are things a certain man believed in. He was my father, John. And when he talked, people listened. They'll listen to you, Funnyyou know what my mother said the other night? She said to look into your eyesthat I'd see Father there.
STAGE MANAGER: Heywhat do you say?
ANN: Okay! We're coming. Come on!
ANN: Now, listen, John. You're a pitcher. Now, get in there and pitch!
STUDIO OFFICIAL: Give him room, let him through. Come Int. broadcasting stage: Med. shot: Camera retreats in front of JOHN and the official, as they leave the office and proceed to the microphones. Everyone stares curiously at JOHNwhispering to each other.
COLONEL: ( to John )
COLONEL: That's what I'd like to know!
JOHN: Say, he's a friend of mine.
ANN: ( at John's elbow )
ANN: No, Johnover here.
SPENCER: Phone the Chronicle . Tell 'em to start getting those extras out.
ANNOUNCER: ( rapid-fire )
JOHN DOE!: The man next to him waves his handthere is an outburst of music.
JOHN: ( reading speech )
JOHN'S VOICE: Well, it was mebefore I said I was gonna jump off the City Hall roof at midnight on Christmas Eve. Now, I guess I'm not average any more. Now, I'm getting all sorts of attention, from big shots, Med. shot: To include JOHN and ANN.
MIKE: ( whispering )
SPENCER: We have!?
JOHN: The Mayor and the Governor, for instance. They don't like those articles I've been writing.
SPENCER'S VOICE: You're an imposter, young fella! That's a pack of lies you're telling!
SPENCER: Who wrote that speech for you?
CONNELL: Beany, get that guy!
JOHN: Well, people like the Governor
JOHN: I'm gonna talk about us, the average guys, the John Does. If anybody should ask you what the average John Doe is like, you couldn't tell him because he's a million and one things. He's Mr. Big and Mr. Small. He's simple and he's wise. He's inherently honest, but he's got a streak of larceny in his heart. He seldom walks up to a public telephone without shoving his finger into the slot to see if somebody left a nickel there.
JOHN'S VOICE: He's the man the ads are written for. He's the fella everybody sells things to. He's Joe Doakes,[8] the world's greatest stooge and the world's greatest ( clearing throat )
TED: Well, what kind of a speech is that? Didn't you read it?
JOHN: We've existed since time began. We built the pyramids, we saw Christ crucified, pulled the oars for Roman emperors, sailed the boats for Columbus, retreated from Moscow with Napoleon and froze with Washington at Valley Forge!
JOHN'S VOICE: Because we're the people and we're Close-up: Of JOHN.
JOHN: They've started a lot of talk about free people going softthat we can't take it. That's a lot of hooey! . . . A free people can beat the world at anything, from war to tiddle-de-winks, if we all pull in the same direction!
JOHN: I know a lot of you are saying "What can I do? I'm just a little punk. I don't count." Well, you're dead wrong! The little punks have always counted because in the long run the character of a country is the sum total of the character of its little punks.
JOHN'S VOICE: But we've all got to get in there and pitch! We can't win the old ball game unless we have team work. And that's where every John Doe comes in! It's up to him to get together with his teammate!
JOHN: And your teammates, my friends, is the guy next door to you. Your neighbor! He's a terribly important guy, that guy next door! You're gonna need him and he's gonna need you . . . so look him up! If he's sick, call on him! If he's hungry, feed him! If he's out of a job, find him one! To most of you, your neighbor is a stranger, a guy with a barking dog, and a high fence around Med. shot: Somewhere in audience.
JOHN'S VOICE: Now, you can't be a stranger to any guy that's on your own team. So tear down the fence that separates you, tear down the fence and you'll tear down a lot of hates and prejudices! Tear down all the fences in the country and you'll really have teamwork!
JOHN'S VOICE: I know a lot of you are saying to yourselves: "He's asking for a miracle to happen. He's expecting people to change all of a sudden." Well, you're wrong. It's no miracle. It's no miracle because I see it happen once every year. And so do you. At Christmas time! There's something swell about the spirit of Christmas, to see what it does to people, all kinds of people . . .
JOHN: Now, why can't that spirit, that same warm Christmas spirit last the whole year round? Gosh, if it ever did, if each and every John Doe would make that spirit last three hundred and sixty-five days out of the year, we'd develop such a strength, we'd create such a tidal wave of good will, that no human force could stand against it.
JOHN: Yes, sir, my friends, the meek can only inherit the earth when the John Does start loving their neighbors. You'd better start right now. Don't wait till the game is called on account of darkness! Wake up, John Doe! You're the hope of the world!
ANN: John! You were wonderful!
JOHN: ( as he reaches COLONEL )
COLONEL: Now you're talking!
COLONEL: Gangway, you heelots!
COLONEL: I knew you'd wake up sooner or later! Boy, am I glad we got out of that mess.
JOHN: I had that five thousand bucks sewed up! Could have been on my way to old Doc Brown!
COLONEL: Yeah, she's a heelot just like the rest of them. It's lucky you got away from What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh? Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . .
JOHN: What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh? Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . .
COLONEL: Tear down all the fences. Why, if you tore one picket off of your neighbor's fence he'd sue you!
JOHN: Five thousand bucks! I had it right in my hand!
COLONEL: Close shot: JOHN and the COLONEL.
JOHN: Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
COLONEL: Four bits.
JOHN: Better make it doughnuts, huh?
COLONEL: What'll it be, gents?
DAN: What'll it be, gents?
JOHN: Have you got a coupla steaks about that big and about that thick?
COLONEL: Er, yeh, with hash-brown potatoes and tomatoes andand apple pie and ice cream and coffee
DAN: And doughnuts! I know. Hey, Ma! Sinkers, a pair!
MA'S VOICE: Sinkers, a pair, coming up.
COLONEL: Glad he took the "T" out of that.
JOHN: ( sees something offnudges the Colonel )
COLONEL: Join the John Doe Club.
JOHN: John Doe Club?
COLONEL: Wider shot. As the WAITER approaches Are you John Doe?
WAITER: Are you John Doe?
COLONEL: ( pointing to paper )
WAITER: ( pointing to paper )
COLONEL: You need glasses, buddy.
WAITER: Well, he's the spittin' image of
COLONEL: Yeah, but his name's Willoughby.
DAN: Long John Willoughby.
JOHN: Long John Willoughby.
COLONEL: ( eyes brightening )
DAN: ( eyes brightening )
DAN: Yeah. Sitting right there, big as life.
CUSTOMER: Who'd you say it was?
DAN: John Doe! The big guy there! Picture's in the paper!
DAN: Hey, Operator? Dan's Beanery. Look. Call everybody in town. John Doe was just in my place. Yeh. He ordered doughnuts.
TOWNSPEOPLE: There he is!
MAYOR HAWKINS: I know, you all voted for me and you're all anxious to see John Doe. We're all neighbors, but my office is packed like a sardine box.
GIRL: What does John Doe look like, Mr. Mayor.
MAYOR HAWKINS: Oh, he's one of those great big outdoor type of men. No, you can't see him.
MAYOR HAWKINS: You didn't vote for me the last time. Shame on youget off my front porch!
ANN: Better let me talk to him.
MAYOR HAWKINS: Ah, here he comes! Give him room down there! Give him room, folks! How do you do, Mr. Norton! I'm the Mayor
COP: ( to Mayor )
MAYOR HAWKINS: ( to cop )
MAYOR: Oh, he's fine. He's right in my office there. You know, this is a great honor having John Doe here, and you too. Haven't had so much excitement since the old city hall burned down.
ANN: Hello, John.
JOHN: D. B. Mister Mayor, if you don't mind, we'd like to talk to him alone.
MAYOR: Why, certainly, certainly. All right, everybody, clear out.
MAYOR'S WIFE: Quit pushing.
MAYOR: Don't argue with me here. Wait till we get home.
WIFE: Don't you push me around like that! Even though I'm your wife, you can't push me around
MAYOR: They all shuffle out, and D.B. shuts the door. JOHN watches him, doesn't like his proprietary manner.
JOHN: Look, Mr. Norton, I think you've got a lot of nerve having those people hold us here.
JOHN: Well, if there's nobody holding us here, let's get going. Incidentally, my name isn't Doe. It's Willoughby.
ANN: ( gets in front of himpleads )
JOHN: ( interested despite himself )
ANN: Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
JOHN: ( regains his former attitude )
ANN: Oh, but you don't know how big this thing is. You should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you.
JOHN: Look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?
ANN: Uh-huh . . .
JOHN: Well, you got your circulation. Now, why don't you let me alone?
ANN: Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.
JOHN: D. B. Why, certainly. With your ability to influence people, it might grow into a glorious movement.
ANN: D. B. Why, certainly. With your ability to influence people, it might grow into a glorious movement.
JOHN: Say, let's get something straight here. I don't want any part of this thing. If you've got an idea I'm going around lecturing to people, why you're crazy! Baseball's my racket, and I'm sticking to it. Come on, Colonel, let's get out of here.
ANN: The beaming COLONEL starts to follow him to the door. When they get there, the door suddenly flies open and a crowd of townspeople push their way inwith the MAYOR and the SHERIFF trying to hold them back.
MAYOR: Please, please! I just got rid of one Oh, but please. Mr. Mayor, tell him the John Doe Club wants to talk to him.
WOMAN: Oh, but please. Mr. Mayor, tell him the John Doe Club wants to talk to him.
MAYOR: Okay, folks, but remember your manners. No stampeding. Walk slow, like you do when you come to pay your taxes.
SOMEONE: Come on, Bert.
BERT: Okay. All right, give me a chance.
WOMAN: ( making room for him )
BERT: ( clearing throat )
BERT: Well, sir, you see, me and my wife, we heard your broadcast, and we got quite a bang out of it, especially my Wider shot: To include JOHN and the Kept me up half the night saying "That man's right, honey. The trouble with the world isnobody gives a hoot about his neighbor. That's why everybody in town's sore and cranky at each other."
BERT: Kept me up half the night saying "That man's right, honey. The trouble with the world isnobody gives a hoot about his neighbor. That's why everybody in town's sore and cranky at each other."
BERT: Well, anyway, the next morning I'm out watering the lawn and I look over and there's Sourpuss on the other side of the hedge straightening out a dent in his fender and, er, my wife yells to me out of the window. She says, "Go on. Speak to him, Bert." And I figured, well, heck, I can't lose anythingso I yelled over to him "Good morning, Mr. Smithers." He went right on pounding his fender, and was I burned! So I turned around to give my wife a dirty look and she said, "Louder, louder. He didn't hear you." So, in a voice you could of heard in the next county, I yelled. "Good morning, Mr. Smithers!"
BERT: Well, sir, you coulda knocked me over with a feather. Old Sourpuss turned around surprised like, and he put on a big smile, came over and took my hand like an old lodge brother, and he said. "Good morning, Hansen. I've been wanting to talk to you for years, only I thought you didn't like me." And then he started chatting away like a happy little kid, and he got so excited his eyes begin waterin' up.
BERT'S VOICE: Well, Mr. Doe, before we got through, I found out Smithers is a swell egg, only he's pretty deaf, and that accounts for all the noises.
BERT: And he says it's a shame how little we know about our neighbors, and then he got an idea, and he said, "How's about inviting everybody some place where we can all get together and know each other a little better?" Well, I'm feeling so good by this time, I'm ripe for anything.
BERT: So Smithers goes around the neighborhood inviting everybody to a meeting at the school house and I tell everybody that comes in the store, including Mr. Schwabacher, my boss.
BERT: Well, I'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another.
BERT'S WIFE: Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, Oh, yeah. We made Sourpuss chairman and decided to call ourselves The John Doe Club. And, say, incidentally, this is my wife. Come here, honey.
BERT: Oh, yeah. We made Sourpuss chairman and decided to call ourselves The John Doe Club. And, say, incidentally, this is my wife. Come here, honey.
BERT: This is my wife, Mr. Doe.
WIFE: How do you do, Mr. Doe . . . Er, Sourpuss is here, too.
BERT: ( turns around )
WIFE: ( pointing )
BERT: This is Sourpuss. Er, excuse me. Er, Mr. Smithers, Mr. Doe.
SOURPUSS: Ththat's all right. If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.
BERT: Well, anyway, II guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, "Say, you've got the Delaneys all wrong." And then he tells
SOURPUSS: Old man Delaney has been bringing his furniture over to my place at night, one piece at a time, and selling it.
BERT: Yeah. And, well, sir, a half a dozen of us ran over there to fetch them and we got them to the meeting. What a reception they got. Why, everybody shook hands with them and made a fuss over them, and, well, finally, Mr. and Mrs. Delaney just sat right down and cried.
SOURPUSS: And then we started to find out about a lot of other people.
BERT: Yeah, sure. Er, you know Grubbel, for BERT'S WIFE Grubbel's here. See?
BERT'S WIFE: Grubbel's here. See?
BERT: Yeah. That'sthat's him. Of course, you don't know Grubbel, but he's the man that everybody figured was the worst no-account in the neighborhood because he was living like a hermit and nobody'd have anything to do with him. Er, that is until Murphy, the postman told us the truth. "Why, Grubbel," he says, "he lives out of garbage cans because he won't take charity. Because it'd ruin his self-respect," he says.
BERT'S WIFE: Just like you said on the radio, Mr. Well, sir, about a dozen families got together and gave Grubbel a job watering their lawns. Isn't that wonderful? And then we found jobs for six other people and they've all gone off relief!
SOURPUSS: Well, sir, about a dozen families got together and gave Grubbel a job watering their lawns. Isn't that wonderful? And then we found jobs for six other people and they've all gone off relief!
BERT: Yeh. Er, and my boss, Mr. Schwabacker made a job in his warehouse for old man Delaney
WIFE: And he gave you that five dollar raise.
BERT: Yeah! Wasn't that swell!
MAYOR: Why, Bert, I feel slighted. I'd like to join but nobody asked me.
SOURPUSS: Well, I'm sorry, Mayor, but we voted that no politicians could join.
BERT'S WIFE: Just the John Does of the neighborhood. Cause you know how politicians are.
SOURPUSS: Yeah . . .
BERT: Well, er, the reason we wanted to tell you this, Mr. Doe, was to give you an idea what you started. And from where I'm sitting, I don't see any sense in your jumping off any building.
GROUP: Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye, Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while.
SOURPUSS: Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye, Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while.
BERT: Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye, Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while.
GROUP: Well, goodbye.
SOURPUSS: Goodbye Mr. Doe.
OLD LADY: I'm Mrs. Delaney, Mr. Doe . . . and God bless you, my boy.
JOHN: Gee, whizI'm all mixed upI don't get it. Look, all those swell people think I'm gonna jump off a building or something.
JOHN: I never had any such idea. Gosh! A fella'd have to be a mighty fine example himself to go around telling other people how toSay, look, what happened the other night was on account of Miss Mitchell, here. She wrote the stuff.
ANN: Don't you see what a wonderful thing this can be?
COLONEL: ( suddenly )
COLONEL: They got you. Well, I'm through.
COLONEL: Gangway, you heelots!
JOHN: ( calling )
JOHN: Hey, Colonel!
CROWD: Oh, please, Mr. Doe
JOHN: ( calling futilely )
CHARLIE: ( an experienced promoter )
JOHNSON: Yes. D. B.
CHARLIE: D. B. There are only eight flags up there now. I want to see that map covered before we get through!
SPEAKER: This has been growing like wildfire! If they only made demands, but the John Does ask for nothing!
MAN: People are going off relief! If this keeps up, I'll be out of a job!
MAN: As soon as he gets strong enough, we'll find out what John Doe wants! Thirty every Thursdaysixty at sixtywho knows 17. Insert: Sign reading: DEMOCRATIC HEADQUARTERS. A man reports to the boss behind the desk.
MAN: I'm sorry, boss. they just won't let anybody talk politics to them. It's, it's crazy.
MAN: We've got to get to them! They represent millions of voters!
DOE HEADQUARTERS.": Int. JOHN DOE headquarters. Med. shot: D.B. standing behind his desk, speaking to a group of people in front of him. We recognize the MAYOR, and the President of the Chamber of Commerce. Representatives of several other branches of the City Administration are also present. CONNELL sits near D. B.scrutinizing him thoughtfully. On the other side of D. B. is TED SHELDON.
MAYOR LOVETT: I'd hate to have that many pins stuck in me!
MAYOR LOVETT: ( disappointed )
MAYOR: Don't worry, D. B. Everything'll be taken care of!
COMMITTEE WOMAN: Isn't it all too wonderful?
PHOTOGRAPHER'S VOICE: ( from the outer office )
CONNELL: ( shaking his head )
CONNELL: Look, D. B. I'm supposed to know my way around. This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention's gonna cost plenty.
CONNELL: Well, I'm stuck with two and twobut I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it.
CONNELL: I see. I'd better stick to running the paper, huh?
CONNELL: Yes. Sure.
CHARLIE: Well, we leave for the airport in half an hour. Is that Johnny-boy's room? I'd better hustle him up!
ANN: He'll be ready on time. He's packing Ah, good!
CHARLIE: Ah, good!
ANN: CHARLIE drops the magazine on the desk in front of her. ANN glances at it, unenthusiastically. CHARLIE goes to a table where there are several bottles of coca-cola and starts to pour himself a drink.
CHARLIE: I gotta give you credit, Annie-girl. I've handled a good many big promotions in my time . . . everything from the world's fair to a channel swimmer, but this one has certainly got me spinning. And now a John Doe Convention! Wow! Say! If you could only get him to jump off the City Hall roof on Christmas Eve, I'd guarantee you half a million people there.
ANN: ANN is lost in troubled thought.
CHARLIE'S VOICE: ( nods toward door )
ANN: ( nods toward door )
CHARLIE: Who, Johnny-boy?
CHARLIE: Well, I don't know what angle you want, but I'll give it to you quick. Number one, he's got great yokel appeal; but he's a nice guy. Number two, he's beginning to believe he really wrote that original suicide letter that you made up. Number three, he thinks that you're Joan of Arc or something!
ANN: ( hoarsely )
CHARLIE: Number four, well, you know what number four is. He's nuts about you. Yeah, it's running out of his ears.
ANN: You left out number five. We're all heels, me especially.
CHARLIE: Holy smoke!
ANN: ( calling )
JOHN: I'm all packed.
CHARLIE: ( starts out )
JOHN: ( kidding him )
CHARLIE: ( laughing )[10]
JOHN: ( after a pause )
ANN: No, thank you.
JOHN: Do you care if I sit down out here?
ANN: A broad smile appears on JOHN'S face.
JOHN: ( laughing )
ANN: About me?
JOHN: ( laughing )
JOHN: There was, there was something I was trying to stop you from doing. So, er, so I got up out of bed and I walked right through the wall here, right straight into your room.
JOHN: And there you were in bed.
JOHN: And very pretty, too. So, I shook you, and the moment you opened your eyes, you hopped out of bed and started running like the devil, in your nightgown.
JOHN: ( awkwardly )
JOHN: Dreams are sure crazy, aren't they?
JOHN: Well, would you like to know who it was you were marrying?
ANN: ( forced lightness )
JOHN: No, not that bad. It was a fella that sends you flowers every day. Er, what's his name? Mr. Norton's nephew.
ANN: ( quietly )
JOHN: Yeah, that's the one.
JOHN: But here's the funniest part of it all. I was the fella up there doing the marrying. You know, the Justice of the Peace or something . . .
ANN: You were? I thought you were chasing Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see? But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
JOHN: Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see? But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
ANN: ( amused )
JOHN: Well, I took you across my knee and I started spanking you.
JOHN: ( quickly explaining )
JOHN: And all the time, er, the guy up there, you know, with the book, me, just stood there nodding his head and he said, "Go to it, Pop, whack her one for me, because that's just the way I feel about it, too."
BEANY: ( interrupting )
CHARLIE: How're you, Beany?
BEANY: When does our plane take off again.
CHARLIE: In a couple of minutes.
JOHN: ( after a pause )
ANN: I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
JOHN: Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out.
ANN: ( in an effort to disillusion him )
JOHN: ( sincerely )
JOHN: ( continuing )
JOHN: Maybe that's why they came. Maybe they were just lonely and wanted somebody to say hello to. I know how they feel. I've been lonely and hungry for something practically all my life.
PILOT: All aboard, folks!
ANN: Oh, somebody else sitting there?
TED: And this is your coat.
ANN: D. B. A little token of appreciation.
ANN: ( glances into a mirror )
ANN: D. B. Go ahead, open it, open it.
ANN: Oh! Oh, it's lovely!
TED: And a new contract goes with it.
ANN: ( shrewdly )
ANN: Must be stupendous.
ANN: ( eyes widening )
ANN: ( in an awed whisper )
ANN: ( on her breath )
N.B.C. ANNOUNCER: And although the opening of the convention is hours off, the delegates are already pouring into the ball park by the droves, with lunch baskets, banners and petitions, asking John Doe not to jump off any roof . . .
KNOX MANNING: It is still a phenomenal movement. The John Does, or the hoi polloi as you've heard people call them, have been laughed at and ridiculed but here they are, gay and happy, having traveled thousands of miles, their expenses paid by their neighbors, to come here to pay homage to their hero, John Doe.
MRS. MITCHELL: Oh, John. Come in.
JOHN: Say, I'm kindait's raining out a little
MRS. MITCHELL: That's all right.
MRS. MITCHELL: ( turning to him )
JOHN: ( mumbles )
JOHN: ( awkwardly )
MRS. MITCHELL: ( taking the box )
JOHN: MRS. MITCHELL I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
MRS. MITCHELL: I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
JOHN: She isn't?
MRS. MITCHELL: No, she just left. I'm surprised you didn't run into her. She went over to Mr. Norton's house.
JOHN: ? 658 ? MRS. MITCHELL Did you want to see her about something Yeah. I, uh, well . . . No. It'll wait.
MRS. MITCHELL: Did you want to see her about something Yeah. I, uh, well . . . No. It'll wait.
JOHN: Yeah. I, uh, well . . . No. It'll wait.
JOHN: Say, my coat's pretty wet. I'm afraid I might have wet the couch a little.
JOHN: Well, I guess I'll see her at the convention MRS. MITCHELL Yes, of course. I'll see that she gets the flowers.
MRS. MITCHELL: Yes, of course. I'll see that she gets the flowers.
JOHN: Thanks. Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.
MRS. MITCHELL: ( finds his hat and gives it to him )
JOHN: ( going back to her )
JOHN: ( suddenly )
JOHN: ( can't get over it )
JOHN: ( whirls )
MRS. MITCHELL: I married him.
JOHN: ( full of excitement )
MRS. MITCHELL: Yeah, yeah, but look, Mrs. Mitchell, you know I love Ann and it's gonna be awfully hard for me to say it because, well, you know, she's so wonderful, and, well, the best I ever was was a bush-league pitcher.
JOHN: Yeah, yeah, but look, Mrs. Mitchell, you know I love Ann and it's gonna be awfully hard for me to say it because, well, you know, she's so wonderful, and, well, the best I ever was was a bush-league pitcher.
JOHN: And you know, I think she's in love with another man, the one she made up. You know, the real John Doe. Well, that's pretty tough competition.
JOHN: I bet you he'd know how to say it all right. And me, I get up to it and around it and in back of it, but, but I never get right to it. Do you know what I mean? So the only chance I've got is, well, if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of, sorta prepare her for the shock!
MRS. MITCHELL: You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?
JOHN: Well, I was thinking thatYeah, you know, sort of break the ice.
MOTHER: Of course I will, John.
JOHN: Gee whiz! Thank you, Mrs. Mitchell.
BEANY: ( to the other men )
BEANY: Why, they're coming from all over; trains, box cars, wagons
JOHN: Hello, bodyguards! Hey, had your dinner Not yet.
BODYGUARD: Not yet.
JOHN: Well, look. No. Go ahead and have your dinner. I'll
CONNELL'S VOICE: Wait a minute, John.
JOHN: Hello, Mr. Connell.
CONNELL: Hiyah, John.
BEANY: ( protesting )
CONNELL: Oh, quiet, quiet, quiet.
JOHN: No, I never read the speeches before I make them. I get more of a kick out of it that way.
CONNELL: ( wisely )
BEANY: ( protesting )
CONNELL: ( shooing him away )
CONNELL: ( after a pause )
CONNELL: Yep, I'm hard. But you want to know something? I've got a weakness. You'd never guess that, would you? Well, I have. Want to know what it is?
CONNELL: The Star Spangled Banner.
JOHN: ( points to back of neck )
CONNELL: Oh, back there, huh?
CONNELL: You weren't old enough for the first world war, were you?
CONNELL: Course not. Must have been a kid.
CONNELL: I was. I was just ripe. And rarin' to ( takes drink )
CONNELL'S VOICE: Got to be a sergeant.
CONNELL: ( as he raises his glass )
CONNELL: ( voice lowers )
CONNELL: I saw him get it. I was right there and saw it with my own eyes.
CONNELL: ( turns to JOHN )
CONNELL: ( yelling to bartender )
BARTENDER'S VOICE: Yes, Mr. Connell?
CONNELL: ( indicates the empty glass )
TUBBY: All right.
CONNELL: ( confidentially )
CONNELL: Now, that's all right, isn't it?
JOHN: You betcha.
CONNELL: All right. And we don't want anybody coming around changing it, do we?
JOHN: No, sir.
CONNELL: No, sir. And when they do I get mad! I get b-boiling mad. And right now, John, I'm sizzling!
CONNELL: I get mad for a lot of other guys besides myselfI get mad for a guy named Washington! And a guy named Jeffersonand Lincoln. Lighthouses, John! Lighthouses in a foggy world! You know what I mean?
JOHN: ( huskily )
CONNELL: ( leans on the table )
JOHN: Yeah. It certainly is.
CONNELL: And you'd feel like an awful sucker if you found yourself marching right in the middle of it, wouldn't you?
CONNELL: And you, of course you wouldn't know it because you're gentle. But that's what you're doing. You're mixed up with a skunk, my boy, a no-good, dangerous JOHN'S resentment vanishesand is replaced by puzzlement.
JOHN: Say, you're not talking about Mr. Norton, are you?
CONNELL: ( emphatically )
JOHN: You must be wrong, Mr. Connell, 'cause he's been marvelous about the John Doe ( sarcastically )
CONNELL: ( sarcastically )
JOHN: Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.
CONNELL: Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.
CONNELL: ( sincerely )
CONNELL: All right! Now, supposing a certain unmentionable worm, whose initials are D. B., was trying to use that to shove his way into the White House. So he could put the screws on, so he could turn out the lights in those lighthouses. What would you say about that? Huh?
JOHN: Nobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell. They can't use the John Doe Clubs for politics. That's the main idea.
CONNELL: Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does!
JOHN: You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
CONNELL: ( cynically )
CONNELL'S VOICE: And get a big bonus for doing them, too. A mink coat and a diamond bracelet.
CONNELL: Don't write 'em? Why, that gold-grabbin' dame would double-cross her own mother for a handful of Chinese yen!
JOHN: ( in an outraged outcry )
BEANY: ( holding out the envelope )
BEANY: ? 667 ? Med. shot: As JOHN pushes CONNELL back into the seat, snatches the envelope from BEANY, and exits.
CONNELL: Go on and read it, John, and then start Wider shot: As JOHN exits from place. BEANY suddenly realizes he has goneand chases after him.
BEANY: Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Doe!
CONNELL: . . . Tubby?
BEANY'S VOICE: Yes, sir?
CONNELL: Better bring me a glass of milk.
CONNELL: ( mumbling )
TED: Don't worry about that, D. B. My boys are there. They'll take care of it.
BUTLER: Why, Mr. Doe . . .
JOHN: Where are they?
BUTLER: In the dining room, sir.
SOMEONE'S VOICE: Yeah, well it's about time.
WESTON: As I said before, I'm with youproviding you can guarantee the John Doe vote.
BENNETT: You can count on me under one condition. Little Bennett's gotta be taken care D. B. Didn't I tell you that everybody in this room would be taken care? My agreement with you gentlemen stands!
BARRINGTON: I'm with you, D. B., but I still think it's a very daring thing we're attempting!
SOMEONE'S VOICE: ANN glances up at D. B., a startled look in her eyes.
WESTON: You're right!
BENNETT: That's true. You're quite right, D.
B.!: D. B. Quite right! Exactly!
GROUP: Quite right! Exactly!
GROUP: Miss Mitchell! Miss Mitchell!
ANN: Mr. Norton, I'd like to talk to you alone for a moment.
GROUP: Well, that's fine. Speech! Speech!
ANN: John! I'm so glad to see you. II was terribly worried.
JOHN: ( showing her a copy of the speech )
ANN: Yes, I did, John. But II had no idea what was going on.
JOHN: You didn't?
JOHN: ( quiet contempt )
JOHN: ( after a pause )
JOHN: No you won't! You're through deciding D. B. cannot believe his ears.
JOHN: And what's more, I'm going down to that convention and I'm gonna tell those people exactly what you and all your fine-feathered friends here are trying to cook up for them!
JOHN: ( strongly )
B.!: Med. shot: At Door. As JOHN reaches it, TED steps up in front of him.
TED: ( menacingly )
JOHN: ( after a pause )
JOHN: ( cynically )
JOHN: ( throwing his hat on the table )
JOHN'S VOICE: Why, look, I'm just a mug and I know it. But I'm beginning to understand a lot of things. Why, your type's old as history. If you can't lay your dirty fingers on a decent idea and twist it and squeeze it and stuff it into your own pocket, you slap it down! Like dogs, if you can't eat something, you bury Close-up: Of JOHN. His voice is pleading.
JOHN: Why, this is the one worthwhile thing that's come along. People are finally finding out that the guy next door isn't a bad egg. That's simple, isn't it? And yet a thing like that's got a chance of spreading till it touches every last doggone human being in the worldand you talk about killing it!
JOHN: Why, when this fire dies down, what's going to be left? More misery, more hunger and more hate. And what's to prevent that from starting all over again? Nobody knows the answer to that one, and certainly not you, with those slimy, bolloxed-up theories you've got! The John Doe idea may be the answer, though! It may be the one thing capable of saving this cockeyed world! Yet you sit back there on your fat hulks and tell me you'll kill it if you can't use it!
ANN: ( sincerely )
JOHN: ( turning to them )
TED: Wait a minute, you ungrateful rat! My Uncle's been too good to
MAN: He's getting away!
ANN: Ext. entrance to D. B.'s house: Med. shot: As JOHN hurries out. He goes by half a dozen members of TED SHELDON's motorcycle troops who wait around to escort D. B. to the convention.
ANN: ? 674 ? I've always told you, D. B. you're playing with dynamite!
BARRINGTON: I've always told you, D. B. you're playing with dynamite!
WESTON: Before he gets through tonight he'll ruin us all!
BENNETT: You've got to stop him, D. B.!
ANN: John! Oh, John, please listen to me! PleaseI can explain everything, John. I didn't know what they were going to do! Let me go with you, John! John, JOHN gets into taxislams doorANN runs beside cab as it starts off.
JOHN: Go ahead, driver! Ball park!
ANN: John, please let me go with you! Please, Several troopers grab ANN.
TROOPER: Mr. Norton wants to see you.
ANN: As the men get a firmer grip on her and ANN fights to get loose: Cut to: Int. D. B.'s study: Med. shot: D. B. is on the phone. The others pace around, perturbedly. HAMMETT has the second phone in his hand.
HAMMETT: ( holds out phone )
WELCOME TO: JOHN DOE CONVENTION People come from all directions and pour through the gates. Some carry umbrellas over their heads, others have their coat collars turned up. Women hold newspapers over their heads to protect their hats. It is a misty, drizzling rain.
MAN: Three cheers for John Doe!
JOHN: Listen, ladies and gentlemen!
CLERGYMAN: Just a moment, John. We begin with a short prayer.
CLERGYMAN: ( speaking into public address system )
NEWSBOYS: Extry, extry! Read all about it!
NEWSBOYS: Extry! John Doe a fake!
NEWSBOYS: ( shouting )
NEWSBOYS: Here you are! No charge! John Doe a Med. shot: Of a second group. Some already have papers and peer, unbelievingly, at the headlines. Others grab papers from newsboys' hands.
MAN: ( reading )
SOURPUSS: How could he be a fake?
BERT: It must be some kind of a gag.
SOURPUSS: A what?
BERT: A gag. A gag!
TED: Come on, come on, step on it! Step on it! Step on it! You all know your places now, so let's get going! Wait for the Med. shot: DRUNK with a balloon. He holds balloon up to TED, getting in TED's way.
DRUNK: Hey, mister, will you autograph my balloon?
TED: ( and breaks balloon )
TROOPER: ( pushing drunk aside )
JOHN: Ladies and gentlemen! This is exactly what I came down here to tell you about tonight. Please, if you'll all just be quiet for a few minutes I can explain this whole thing to you. As you all know, this paper is published by a man by the name of D. B. Norton . . .
TROOPER: ( drags John from mike )
JOHN: That's a lie!
JOHN: That's a lie! Listendon't believe what he says . . .
JOHN: That's got nothing to do with it!
JOHN: Yes! I was paid! But the
JOHN: What difference does that make?
JOHN: No, I didn't write it, but
JOHN: Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing ? 680 ? D. B. There! You see? He admits it! You're a fake, John Doe! And for what you've done to all these good peoplethey ought to run you out of the countryand I hope they do it!
VOICE: Speak up, John! We believe you!
JOHN: Please listen, folks! Now that he's through shooting off his face, I've got a couple of things to tell you about
TED: Come on! The rest of you get in here and riot! Break this crowd up! Come Med. shot: Of a group of John Does. They still stare uncertainly. Suddenly, the head of one of SHELDON's troopers appearand cupping his hands over his mouth, he yells toward platform.
TROOPER: John Doe's a fake! Boo! Boooooo!
ANNOUNCER: I'm sorry, folks, but we can't hear him any more. Something's gone wrong with the loudspeaker.
JOHN: Say, they can't hear me! The thing's not working!
BERT: ( cynically )
BERT: Well, there you are, Mr. Doe!
SOURPUSS: It makes no difference, Bertthe ideas's still good. We don't have to give up our club.
BERT: ( harshly )
ANNOUNCER: They're starting to throw things!
2ND ANNOUNCER: Somebody's going to get hurt!
ANNOUNCER: I'm afraid it'll be John Doe. Listen to that mob!
ANN: I've got to go to him!
OFFICER: Sorry, ladyI can't let you out.
ANN: ( sobbing )
OFFICER: Sorry, sister. We got orders to hold Orders from who? Can't they see it's a frameup?
ANN: Orders from who? Can't they see it's a frameup?
MRS. MITCHELL: Ann, darling!
ANN: Oh, Mother! They won't let me go! They won't let me go!
JOHN: Listen, folks! You gotta listen to me, Med. shot: Of a group of John Does.
A MAN: ( yelling toward JOHN )
2ND MAN: ( disgustedly )
JOHN'S VOICE: Stick to your clubs!
MAN: ( shouting )
JOHN: ( supplicatingly )
WOMAN: ( shouting )
JOHN: ( hoarsely )
ANNOUNCER'S VOICE: Ladies and gentlemen, this certainly looks like the end of the John Doe movement.
CONNELL: ( lifts glass of milk )
ANN: ( sobbing )
SOURPUSS: ( throatily )
COLONEL'S VOICE: Have some more coffee, Long John?
JOHN: No, thanks, Colonel.

GIRL'S VOICE: Christmas Eve at midnight!
BERT: You're a wonderful man, Mr. Doe.
MRS. DELANEY: May God bless you, my boy.
ANN: Now, get in there and pitch!
GIRL: Christmas Eve at midnight?
BUTLER: Merry Christmas, sir.
SERGEANT: Who? John Doe? Is that screwball still ( laughing )
POLICEMAN: ( with disgust )
DESK SERGEANT: Sure, sure, I know. Yeah. At midnight, huh? Okay, lady. We'll have the place surrounded with nets.
ANN: Ohthey're laughing at me!
DOCTOR'S VOICE: You're a sick girl, Ann. You'd better take it easy.
MRS. MITCHELL: Whom are you calling now? You called that number not ten minutes ago!
ANN: ( into phone )
CONNELL: Now listen, Annhe can't possibly get in without our seeing him. I'm watching the side door and the Colonel's out front, so stop worrying.
ANN: Thank you.
MRS. MITCHELL: Why, Ann! . . .
DOCTOR: Ann, don't be foolish!
BERT: ( complainingly )
MRS. HANSEN: Oh, shut up. Bert. Sourpuss is right.
BERT: Yeah? Well, if he is, I'm a banana split!
SOURPUSS: That man is gonna be on that roof. Don't ask me how I know. I just know. And you know it as well as I do.
BERT: Sure, sure. I'd like to believe in fairy tales, but a guy that's fake isn't gonna jump off any roof.
MRS. HANSEN: I don't think he was any fakenot with that face. And, anyway, what he stood for wasn't a fake.
BERT: Okay, honey, okay.
COLONEL: Elevators ain't running.
ANN: You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Has he been here?
COLONEL: You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Has he been here?
ANN: Has he been here?
COLONEL: Have you seen him?
ANN: Have you seen him?
COLONEL: ( sadly )
ANN: Where's Connell?
COLONEL: He's watching the other door.
ANN: Oh. Gee, you're swell! Oh.
COLONEL: ( grabs her )
ANN: ( pulls away from him )
COLONEL: ( calling after her )
MAYOR: This is as far as the elevator goes. We've got to walk up to the tower.
BENNETT: ( breaking the silence )
MAYOR: Let's go. I've got to decorate my tree.
WESTON: I guess you're right. I'm afraid the joke's on us. Let's go.
JOHN: ( in a sepulchral voice )
JOHN: ( quicklythreateningly )
JOHN: ( throatily )
ANN: ( an outcry )
ANN: ( crying )
ANN: ( muffled sobs )
ANN: ( muffled sobs )
ANN: ( in a desperate plea )
ANN: ( excitedly )
ANN: Oh, darling. Sure, it should have been killed before. It was dishonest.
ANN'S VOICE: But we can start clean now. Just you and I. It'll grow again, John. It'll grow big. And it'll be strong, because it'll be honest!
ANN: ( last bit of effort )
ANN: ( a murmured prayer )
ANN: ( tensely )
ANN: John, look at me. You want to be honest, don't you? Well, you don't have to die to keep the John Doe idea alive! Someone already died for that once! The first John Doe. And He's kept that idea alive for nearly two thousand years.
ANN'S VOICE: ( with sincere conviction )
ANN: ( ecstatically )
ANN: You and I, John, we can
BERT'S VOICE: Mr. Doe . . .
BERT: ( his voice chokedhaltingly )
BERT'S WIFE: ( jumping in )
WIFE'S VOICE: We were going to start up our John Doe Club again whether we saw you or not.
WIFE: Weren't we, Bert?
WIFE: And there were a lot of others that were going to do the same thing. Why, Mr. Sourpuss even got a letter from his cousin in Toledo, and . . .
SOURPUSS: ( joiningeagerly )
WIFE'S VOICE: ( choked )
