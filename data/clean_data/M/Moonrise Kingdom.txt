MOONRISE KINGDOM: Written by Wes Anderson & Roman Coppola
NARRATOR: This is the island of New Penzance. Sixteen miles long. Forested with old- growth pine and maple. Criss-crossed by shallow tidal creeks. An important seabird habitat. There are no paved roads but instead many miles of intersecting foot paths and dirt trails and a ferry that runs twice daily from Stone Cove. The year is 1965. We are on the far edge of Black Beacon Sound, famous for the ferocious and well-documented storm which will strike from the east on the fifth of September in three day's time.
GADGE: Morning, sir. Gadge flips open a small, spiral-bound note-book. Scout Master Ward goes over to a latrine made from thick sticks and rope. A tall, stooped scout digs a trench next to it with an army-shovel. He is Deluca.
ROOSEVELT: ( FRUSTRATED )
SKOTAK: ( CHEERILY )
SKOTAK: Well, where would you've built it?
PANAGLE: Sixteen and a half.
REDFORD: Safety-test, sir.
REDFORD: The vehicle appears to be in good working order. I'm just checking if
CAPTAIN SHARP: Watch my line, Edgar.
CAPTAIN SHARP: Hello? This is Captain Sharp. Over. Scout Master Ward's voice comes over a crackly speaker:
CAPTAIN SHARP: Morning, Randy. What can I do for you? SCOUT MASTER WARD ( V.O. ) I'm not sure, exactly. I've got an escaped Khaki Scout. Over. Silence. Captain Sharp frowns slightly.
CAPTAIN SHARP: What does that mean? Over.
CAPTAIN SHARP: Any idea why? Over.
CAPTAIN SHARP: I guess we better notify his folks. Over.
BECKY: Hello, Diane.
BECKY: Hold the line, please. Becky signals to Captain Sharp and Scout Master Ward. They sit down quickly and put on their own sets of operator head- Go ahead, Chesterfield.
BECKY: Go ahead, Chesterfield.
MR. BILLINGSLEY: CAPTAIN SHARP
CAPTAIN SHARP: Hello, sir. This is Captain Sharp.
MR. BILLINGSLEY: Yes, sir. I received your message. Thank you very much. In fact, we've come to a decision, as a family, because this is only the most recent incident involving Sam's troubles, and it's just not fair to the others, so, unfortunately we can't invite him back, at this time. Captain Sharp, Scout Master Ward, and Becky all look puzzled. Captain Sharp says evenly:
CAPTAIN SHARP: There's no cause for alarm, sir. We'll find him. We're just notifying you as a matter of protocol and so on.
MR. BILLINGSLEY: I understand that. I'm notifying you of the situation on my end.
CAPTAIN SHARP: I'm confused by that statement. You can't invite him back?
MR. BILLINGSLEY: I'm afraid not. He's a good boy, he's got a good heart, but it's just not fair to the others, you see? He's emotionally Long pause. No one moves except Mrs. Billingsley icing her cake. Captain Sharp says finally:
CAPTAIN SHARP: Am I speaking to Sam's father? Mr. Billingsley frowns. He says, surprised:
MR. BILLINGSLEY: No, sir. Sam's parents passed away a number of years ago. We're Mr. and Mrs. Billingsley. We're foster parents. Sam's been with us since last June. Mrs. Billingsley has stopped icing her cake. She watches Mr. Billingsley. Scout Master Ward interjects:
MR. BILLINGSLEY: Well, it's a known fact. Of course, he SCOUT MASTER WARD Why the hell doesn't it say that in the register? Excuse my language. Scout Master Ward holds up a manila file-card. Mr. Billingsley shrugs.
MR. BILLINGSLEY: I don't know. What register?
MR. BILLINGSLEY: We sent him a letter. It should reach you Scout Master Ward looks quickly through his stack of letters. He stops and pulls out an air-mail envelope. He stares at it. Captain Sharp says forcefully but highly agitated:
CAPTAIN SHARP: Mr. Billingsley, I've got an escaped Khaki Scout. We're notifying you as a matter of protocol. You say you can't invite him back? You say he's an orphan? Well, I don't understand how that works.
MR. BILLINGSLEY: That's up to Social Services. They'll be in touch with you. They'll look after Sam. Good luck to you. Mr. Billingsley hangs up the telephone. Becky pulls the cords out of their sockets. Captain Sharp looks to Scout Master Ward. Silence. Becky opens a tin of home-made chocolate chip cookies. Captain Sharp declines one. Scout Master Ward tries one. He looks very impressed.
REDFORD: What if he resists?
REDFORD: Shakusky. Are we allowed to use force on SCOUT MASTER WARD No, you're not. This is a non-violent rescue effort. Your instructions are to find him, not to hurt him. Under any circumstances. Do I make myself The scouts murmur their understanding. Scout Master Ward SCOUT MASTER WARD Pause. Scout Master Ward wheels back to Lazy-Eye:
SKOTAK: Right here. Skotak holds up a leash attached to a wire-haired terrier. Scout Master Ward takes a sock with a fleur-de-lis on it out of a paper sack.
GADGE: I heard he never had any family in the first place.
DELUCA: That's probably why he's crazy.
REDFORD: I'll tell you one thing: if we find him, I'm not going to be the one who forgot to bring a weapon.
NICKLEBY: Me, neither.
MR. BISHOP: Camp Ivanhoe? That's all the way across the other side of the island. You really think a twelve-year-old boy could row this far in a canoe?
CAPTAIN SHARP: Most likely not.
MRS. BISHOP: ( with a shrug ) It's possible, Counsellor.
MR. BISHOP: ( SLIGHTLY IRRITATED )
MRS. BISHOP: I don't think so. Two days, maximum.
MR. BISHOP: Well, I'm not going to argue about it.
CAPTAIN SHARP: Be that as it may, will you let me know if you see anything unusual?
BENJAMIN BRITTEN'S: "NOYE'S FLUDDE"
"NOYE'S FLUDDE": Performed by the Choristers of St. Jack Wood and New Penzance
SAM: What kind of bird are you? Suzy hesitates. She looks to the girl next to her, who says in a bossy voice:
BOSSY GIRL: I'm a sparrow, she's a dove, and Sam does not look away from Suzy as he interrupts, pointing:
SAM: No, I said, "What kind of bird are you?" The other girls all look to Suzy. Pause.
SUZY: I'm a raven.
BOSSY GIRL: Boy's aren't allowed in here. Sam does not look away from Suzy as he answers quietly:
SAM: I'll be leaving soon. Sam points down at Suzy's lap. One of her hands is wrapped in a bandage.
SAM: What happened to your hand?
SUZY: ( PAUSE )
SAM: ( TAKEN ABACK )
SUZY: ( SHRUGS )
SUZY: What's your name?
SAM: Sam. What's yours?
SUZY: I'm Suzy. Sam nods with his eyes still glued to Suzy's. Suzy bites her fingernails. The bossy girl rolls her eyes.
BOSSY GIRL: It's not polite to stare. Sam holds up his hand for the bossy girl to stop talking. Mrs. Lynn steps into the doorway.
MRS. LYNN: Birds! Ready?
MRS. LYNN: Who are you? Where'd you come from? Go back to your seat. Sam hesitates. He spits the mint into a trash can, ducks out through the clothing rack, and is gone. A skinny girl dressed as an owl watches Suzy while the other girls hurry to their feet. She says quietly:
SKINNY GIRL: He likes you.
SAM: Were you followed?
SUZY: ( LOOKING AROUND )
SAM: Sam frowns and squints. He points.
SAM: Did you bring a cat? Suzy nods. Sam smiles. Suzy smiles. Sam takes a folded map out of his pocket. He signals for Suzy to come closer.
SAM: Can you read a map?
SUZY: I do cartography. Sam points to one of the patches on his sash. It has a protractor embroidered on it. He unfolds the map.
SAM: I do cartography. Sam points to one of the patches on his sash. It has a protractor embroidered on it. He unfolds the map.
SAM: I feel we should go halfway today and halfway tomorrow, since you're a less experienced hiker, and you're wearing Sunday-school shoes.
SUZY: ( pointing on the map ) Here's where we are right now. I'd like to pitch camp here by sixteen-hundred ( which means four o'clock ). How does that You want some beef jerky?
SAM: ( pointing on the map ) Here's where we are right now. I'd like to pitch camp here by sixteen-hundred ( which means four o'clock ). How does that You want some beef jerky?
SUZY: You want some beef jerky?
SAM: You want some beef jerky?
SUZY: Sam tears a strip of dried meat in two and gives half to Suzy. She tries to chew on it. Sam nods:
SAM: Let's go.
SAM: Are you thirsty?
SUZY: Well, if your throat gets parched, stick a pebble in your mouth and suck on it. You can quench your thirst with the spit, Sam shows Suzy some bits of green and yellow sticking out from under his coonskin cap.
SAM: Well, if your throat gets parched, stick a pebble in your mouth and suck on it. You can quench your thirst with the spit, Sam shows Suzy some bits of green and yellow sticking out from under his coonskin cap.
SAM: Sometimes I stick leaves under my hat. It cools your head down.
SUZY: That's a good idea. It might help also if you didn't wear fur.
SAM: ( HESITATES )
SAM: Here's a trick. Throw grass in the air, and you can see which direction the wind's blowing. Sam throws up the grass. It swirls and drifts vaguely. Suzy Which way?
SUZY: Which way?
SAM: Unknown. I guess it doesn't really matter, as long as we cover our tracks.
SAM: These might be poisonous.
SUZY: ( STUDYING THEM )
SAM: Not bad. Anyway, they're good for Sam and Suzy look through Suzy's binoculars at a deer drinking from a stream. Suzy whispers:
SUZY: He knows someone's watching him.
SAM: I agree. Why do you say that?
SUZY: ( SQUINTING )
SAM: You smell like perfume.
SUZY: It's my mother's. Sam picks up two pebbles. He and Suzy both put them in their mouths. They click against their teeth.
SAM: I brought water, too. Sam and Suzy watch a small, green worm wriggling in the air, swaying from a silk thread. They stare, wide-eyed. Suzy cups her hand a few inches below it and moves it around in a circle. Sam shrugs.
SAM: Should we catch him?
SUZY: ( HESITATES )
SAM: Trout bait. We need worms.
SUZY: ( SHARPLY )
SAM: You're right. We'll let him live. Maybe I've got a licorice whip.
SAM: How strong of a swimmer are you?
SUZY: Pretty good. I broke our school record for the back-stroke.
SAM: ( MILDLY SURPRISED )
SUZY: Sam and Suzy both strap on vests belted with cork blocks.
SAM: Watch out for turtles. They'll bite you, if you put your fingers in their mouths. Let me see if I can catch this one. Sam dips a net into the lake and brings it up with a small turtle in it. He lifts it out of the net. It has red and yellow markings and a slightly damaged shell. Sam flips it over. The word Albert is written on the underside of the turtle in magic marker. Sam says blankly:
SAM: Somebody wrote on him. The fishing pole jerks in Suzy's hands. She yells:
SUZY: The stick's moving!
SAM: ( ALERTED )
SAM: Fish on hook!
SUZY: Sit down! Sam sits back down. Suzy winds the reel carefully. Sam says,
SAM: You're doing good. Sam points to one of the patches on his sash. It has a rod and reel embroidered on it.
SAM: This is for fishing.
SUZY: Very good. You know a lot about camping, don't you?
SAM: ( STIFFENING )
SAM: Anyway, I used to be. Sam serves the fish onto two tin plates. He says as they eat with folding forks:
SAM: We can feed your cat the guts and Sam points to a pile of bloody organs and bones on a page of newspaper. Suzy frowns.
SUZY: That's OK. He only eats cat food. Suzy points to a cardboard box. Sam looks inside. It is filled with ten cans of cat food. Sam raises an eyebrow.
SAM: What else did you bring? We should make an inventory.
SUZY: Sam flips open a small, spiral-bound note-book.
SAM: Go ahead.
SUZY: This is my record player. It works with batteries. Actually, it belongs to my little brother Lionel. I left him a note. Do you like music? Sam nods and makes a note. Suzy opens her leather folder. There are three L.P. records in it. She takes out one by a French singer.
SUZY: This is my favorite record album. My godmother gave it to me for my birthday. She lives in France. Sam nods and makes another note. Suzy opens her suitcase. It is filled to the brim with hard-back copies of fantasy books. It contains no other items of any kind ( including clothing ).
SUZY: These are my books. I like stories with magic powers in them. Either in kingdoms on earth or on foreign planets. Also, time-travel, if they make it realistic. Usually, I prefer a girl hero, but not always. I couldn't bring all of them because it got too heavy. You can borrow any you want. Sam nods and makes another note. Suzy produces a few more
SUZY: I also brought my lefty scissors because I'm left-handed, my toothbrush, some rubber bands, extra batteries, and my binoculars, as you know. I forgot my Sam surveys the entire collection of articles. He scratches his head.
SAM: That's it? No mess-kit? No flashlight? No canteen? No waterproof matches? Didn't you get the packing list I sent you in my last letter?
SUZY: ( FROWNS )
SAM: That's OK. We can share. Sam picks up one of the books. It is called The Girl from Jupiter. There is an illustration on the cover of a young, alien princess with glittering tears on her cheeks. Sam examines the other books in the suitcase. He looks slightly These are all library books. In my school you're only allowed to check-out one at a time. Some of these are going to be Sam hesitates. He suddenly realizes something. He asks
SAM: These are all library books. In my school you're only allowed to check-out one at a time. Some of these are going to be Sam hesitates. He suddenly realizes something. He asks
SAM: Do you steal? Silence. Suzy nods reluctantly. Sam looks confused.
SAM: Why? You're not poor. Suzy stares at the books. She absently brushes some dust off them. She rearranges them slightly. She says finally:
SUZY: I might turn some of them back in one day. I haven't decided yet. I know it's bad. I think I just took them to have a secret to keep. Anyway, for some reason, it makes me feel in a better mood Sam thinks about this. He leans his chin against his fist. He
SAM: Are you depressed? Suzy bites her fingernails. She shrugs.
SAM: How come?
SUZY: Well, I can show you an example, if you want but it doesn't make me feel very good. I found this on top of our Suzy looks into her leather folder and shuffles through some pages. She withdraws a small pamphlet.
SAM: Does that mean you? Suzy nods. Sam explodes with laughter.
SUZY: It's not funny.
SAM: To me, it is. Sam slaps his knee and shakes his head. Pause. Suzy dumps her fish into the campfire and throws her metal plate like a frisbee into a tree trunk. It bounces off with a ding. She stands up and says coolly:
SUZY: You really know how to make friends. Suzy walks away. She goes behind a bush and sits down on a rock. She starts to cry. Sam looks stricken and confused. He is very still. He gets up slowly. He tentatively approaches the bush. He looks behind it. He takes two steps closer. He stands above Suzy. He unties his neckerchief, crouches down, and holds it out.
SAM: I'm sorry. Suzy looks to Sam. She hesitates. She takes the neckerchief.
SUZY: That's OK.
SAM: I'm on your side.
SUZY: I know. Suzy dries her eyes. She unfolds the neckerchief and studies its design. It is a brave shooting an arrow while leaning off the side of a galloping horse. Sam motions to the books:
SAM: Which one's the best?
SUZY: His eyes downcast, his kingdom in ruins, Mynar pressed his heavy paw through the rippling surface of the cool shallows and down to its stone floor. "My people once were lead by a great and noble beast and I no longer see his face in this Suzy looks to Sam. He is asleep. She takes the pipe out of his mouth and tips the ashes into the camp-fire. She draws a blanket over his chest. She continues:
SUZY: Meanwhile, on the Plains of Tabitha, Francine rested. There would be another time for war.
MRS. BISHOP: Where's your sister?
LIONEL: I don't know, but she borrowed my record player for ten days without asking.
MRS. BISHOP: ( CONFUSED )
MRS. BISHOP: Does it concern you that your daughter's just run away from home?
MR. BISHOP: ( PAUSE )
MRS. BISHOP: Come down and read this. A radio squawks in the woods behind the house. Mr. and Mrs. Bishop turn quickly toward the sound. Mrs. Bishop looks tense. Becky's garbled voice says over a tinny speaker:
MR. BISHOP: Who's there? Captain Sharp emerges slowly from the dark, tangled in a bramble, hopping slowly on one foot as he unwinds a root from around his ankle. He smiles awkwardly and says:
CAPTAIN SHARP: Good evening. Sorry to startle you. I was
JUST: MR. BISHOP What are you doing here? Nobody called the police.
MR. BISHOP: ( ANGRILY )
CAPTAIN SHARP: I know, that's what I'm saying. The search party's not over yet. In other
WORDS: MRS. BISHOP Suzy's missing, too! Go find her.
MRS. BISHOP: Suzy's missing, too! Go find her.
CAPTAIN SHARP: ( HESITATES )
MR. BISHOP: Wait for me. Mr. Bishop disappears into the house. Captain Sharp and Mrs. Bishop exchange an uncertain look.
MR. BISHOP: How can we help her? She's got so many problems. It's getting worse. Mr. Bishop looks strangely to Captain Sharp. He asks:
MR. BISHOP: Whose fault is it?
CAPTAIN SHARP: ( HESITATES )
MR. BISHOP: She doesn't have any friends.
CAPTAIN SHARP: ( LONG PAUSE )
MR. BISHOP: ( IRRITATED )
CAPTAIN SHARP: Mrs. Bishop, I mean.
MR. BISHOP: I don't understand.
CAPTAIN SHARP: Is she upset? Mr. Bishop looks baffled and disgusted. He throws his hands into the air. He looks away and shakes his head. Silence. Captain Sharp wiggles some wires.
CAPTAIN SHARP: I got to get this spot-light fixed.
MRS. BISHOP: She has a pen pal! It's very intimate! They planned this together! Captain Sharp takes one of the letters and studies it. He says to himself:
CAPTAIN SHARP: Sam Shakusky. That's my escaped Khaki Scout. His family died. Mr. Bishop takes a handful of the letters and flips through them. He stops suddenly. He looks horrified.
MR. BISHOP: Holy Christ. What am I looking at?
MRS. BISHOP: He does watercolors! Mostly landscapes, but a few nudes! Lionel, Murray, and Rudy watch from a downstairs window. Lionel takes a bite from a bowl of melting ice cream. Mr. Bishop stares at the painting. He squints at it and asks
MR. BISHOP: She sit for this? Captain Sharp and Mrs. Bishop look over Mr. Bishop's shoulder. Captain Sharp says calmly:
CAPTAIN SHARP: What does he say?
BECKY: I'm not sure. I think he went searching in the dark. Mr. Bishop says loudly without looking up from the ground:
MR. BISHOP: She stole the batteries out of my Scout Master Ward looks at Becky and grimaces. Becky raises an eyebrow. Mrs. Bishop stands next to Captain Sharp. They move slightly away from the others. Captain Sharp whispers quickly, almost inaudibly:
CAPTAIN SHARP: I think he's onto us.
MRS. BISHOP: ( INSTANTLY )
CAPTAIN SHARP: Of course, he is?
MRS. BISHOP: Of course, he is.
CAPTAIN SHARP: ( CONFUSED )
MRS. BISHOP: I am.
CAPTAIN SHARP: ( ASTONISHED )
MRS. BISHOP: No. He fell in a ditch.
NICKLEBY: Cat food! I think it's a clue. The group quickly gathers around Nickleby. Mr. Bishop snatches the can out of his hand and examines it. He says
MR. BISHOP: That's her. Mr. Bishop throws the can away over his shoulder and walks off with his hands in his pockets. Nickleby runs after the can and picks it up again. Mr. Bishop continues down the hill. Scout Master Ward watches him. He asks Mrs. Bishop,
MRS. BISHOP: I don't know. Mrs. Bishop follows Mr. Bishop. Captain Sharp turns to the rest of the group and says briskly:
CAPTAIN SHARP: All right. We know they're together. We know they're within a certain radius of this spot. I'm declaring the case with the county right now. Until help arrives: Captain Sharp looks to Scout Master Ward as he points to various scouts and divides the group into teams:
CAPTAIN SHARP: I'm deputizing the little guy, the skinny one, and the kid with the curly hair to come with me in the station wagon. Randy, you drop-in and head up-river with the rest of your troop, then split-up on foot. Becky, call Jed and tell him to circle over this end of the island and fly low.
SUZY: They found the canoe.
SAM: ( angry at himself ) Rats! I should've put more pine needles on it. Let's go. We're almost there. Sam lifts his backpack onto his back and slings his air-rifle over his arm. Suzy picks up her suitcases and puts the kitten on her shoulder. They walk down a narrow path through a thicket. They emerge into a small clearing. Sam and Suzy stop in their tracks. Deluca, Nickleby, Panagle, Izod, and Lazy-Eye stand in a row along the edge of the woods ahead of them. Deluca brandishes his hunting knife. Nickleby, Izod, and Lazy-Eye point their bows and arrows. Panagle holds his walking stick weapon. The wire-haired terrier strains growling at the end of his leash. Deluca jerks him back. The kitten cowers. The sound of a motorcycle guns, and Redford bursts through the trees, pops a wheelie, and skids to a stop. He lifts his goggles. The motor idles. Sam says finally:
SAM: What do you creeps want? Redford shrugs and answers with a callous smile:
REDFORD: We're looking for you.
SAM: Because you're a fugitive.
REDFORD: Because you're a fugitive.
SAM: No, I'm not. Didn't you get my letter of resignation? I quit the Khaki Scouts.
REDFORD: You're still in uniform. Pause. Sam quickly takes off his shirt and throws it aside.
REDFORD: Well, it doesn't matter, anyway. You don't have that authority. We've been deputized. Now are you going to come along peacefully or not? Sam takes a deep breath. He pleads:
SAM: Listen to some reason: I don't like you. You don't like me. Why don't you stupid idiots just let us disappear?
REDFORD: ( PAUSE )
DELUCA: You shouldn't be friends with him.
SUZY: ( OFFENDED )
DELUCA: Because he's crazy.
SUZY: ( COLDLY )
REDFORD: We know him a lot better than you. He's emotionally disturbed because his family died. Nickleby, tie him up. Nickleby takes a step forward with his bow and arrow pointed and ready. Suzy looks furious. Sam flips his air-rifle off his shoulder with a twirl. He points it at Redford and Nickleby. Nickleby hesitates. Sam says darkly:
SAM: Do not cross this stick. Sam motions to a twig on the ground in front of him. Silence.
REDFORD: You're doomed, Shakusky. Redford revs the motor, pops the clutch, and races across the clearing toward Sam and Suzy. The rest of the troop converges, yelling crazily.
SAM: It was him or us. Suzy nods. She turns slowly away. Her eyes widen.
SUZY: Oh, no. Suzy points. The wire-haired terrier lies on his back on the ground with an arrow sticking out between his shoulder blades. The kitten licks at the wound. Sam and Suzy run over to the wounded dog. Sam crouches down, gently presses the kitten away, and says bleakly:
SAM: They got Snoopy through the neck. Suzy has tears in her eyes. She slides her hands under the wire-haired terrier's body. She begins to hyperventilate as
SUZY: He needs a doctor. Sam puts his finger to the wire-haired terrier's neck. He
SAM: No, he doesn't. He needs a morgue.
SUZY: ( trying to catch her breath ) He's losing blood. Hurry. Where do we go? Suzy lifts the bleeding dog into her arms. Sam grabs her by the shoulders. He locks eyes with her and says with grit and
SAM: Suzy. Look at me. Snoopy's not going to make it.
SUZY: ( starting to cry ) Don't say that.
SAM: They're after us. We got to move.
SUZY: ( raising her voice ) He's dying! We can't just leave him!
SAM: ( SHOUTING )
SUZY: ( SCREAMING )
SAM: I'm sorry I had to do that, but you're panicking. The first rule in any emergency is you never Suzy drops the wire-haired terrier which hits the ground with a thud. She slaps Sam back with a huge, roundhouse smack. Sam falls over sideways. Suzy stands over him.
SUZY: Don't ever do that again. No one's allowed to slap me. Sam stands up and dusts himself off. He and Suzy stare down at the lifeless animal. Suzy says quietly:
SUZY: You're right. He's dead. Sam reaches into a side-picket of his back-pack and takes out an army-shovel. He assembles it. Suzy says hopefully:
SUZY: Was he a good dog? Pause. Sam shrugs. He says distantly, even cosmically:
SAM: Who's to say but he didn't deserve to Suzy slowly wraps her arm around Sam's shoulder. They squeeze each other tightly. Sam sighs. He begins to dig.
CAPTAIN SHARP: Puncture wound. Lower lumbar. Make room for a stretcher in the cockpit! Redford is lying on his stomach on a towel in the rear of the vehicle. Scout Master Ward kneels next to him pressing his hand firmly into the middle of his back. There is significant blood. Redford moans loudly. Scout Master Ward reassures him:
NICKLEBY: I tried to chop him, but he dodged my Who else got hit?
PANAGLE: Who else got hit?
IZOD: Not me. I ran away when the girl went He's got great marksmanship. He shot Deluca in both arms. Skotak points to the front seat. Deluca sits glumly in silence. He has numerous small welts all over his arms. Gadge
SKOTAK: He's got great marksmanship. He shot Deluca in both arms. Skotak points to the front seat. Deluca sits glumly in silence. He has numerous small welts all over his arms. Gadge
GADGE: Where's Snoopy?
MR. BISHOP: What happened? Who's that? Why's he Clear the dock, Edgar! Captain Sharp motions for the two old fishermen to get out of the way. He and Scout Master Ward run with the stretcher onto the dock. Mrs. Bishop is frantic:
CAPTAIN SHARP: Clear the dock, Edgar! Captain Sharp motions for the two old fishermen to get out of the way. He and Scout Master Ward run with the stretcher onto the dock. Mrs. Bishop is frantic:
MRS. BISHOP: Is Suzy with you?
GADGE: No, she's in the woods with Shakusky. Gadge points toward the hills. A man wearing a jumpsuit and aviator sunglasses stands next to the seaplane. He is Jed. He shouts as the stretcher approaches:
JED: Where'm I going?
CAPTAIN SHARP: The infirmary at Fort Lebanon. We'll be right behind you.
CAPTAIN SHARP: Warm up the motor. I'll be right back. Scout Master Ward takes the keys and starts untying the police launch. Captain Sharp heads toward his office. Mr. Bishop says firmly:
MR. BISHOP: Hold it right there. You're not leaving this island. Our daughter's been abducted by one these beige lunatics.
CAPTAIN SHARP: Walt, it's very clear: the two of them conspired in this together.
MR. BISHOP: Why can't you control your scouts? Scout Master Ward recoils. He says quietly, troubled:
CAPTAIN SHARP: Mr. Bishop scuffles with Captain Sharp. Mrs. Bishop jerks him backwards and shouts:
MRS. BISHOP: Stop it, Walt! Mr. Bishop faces Mrs. Bishop and Captain Sharp, breathing heavily. Scout Master Ward looks depressed. Jed, Gadge, Skotak, and Redford watch frozen from a gangplank alongside the seaplane.
CAPTAIN SHARP: I do blame him ( pointing to Scout Master Ward ) but I also blame myself and both of you. With all due respect: you can't let your children stab people.
MRS. BISHOP: ( HESITATES )
MRS. BISHOP: I don't get it. Were there witnesses?
MRS. BISHOP: I beg your pardon. Are you a lawyer?
MRS. BISHOP: ( FURIOUS )
CAPTAIN SHARP: Easy does it. Calm down, Laura.
MR. BISHOP: Stay away from my wife. Mr. Bishop pushes Captain Sharp away from Mrs. Bishop into Scout Master Ward. Scout Master Ward lunges at Mr. Bishop but is intercepted by Captain Sharp and Mrs. Bishop. They shout
NARRATOR: As some of you know, I taught Sam for the cartography Accomplishment Patch. He's a smart boy, and he expressed a keen interest in the history of the island's indigenous peoples. In particular, I recall his fascination with the idea of retracing the original path of the old Chickchaw harvest migration. Long pause. Everyone looks utterly perplexed. The propeller of the seaplane starts up, and they all shield their eyes from the blast of wind and dust. The narrator hesitates. He yells over the noise:
NARRATOR: What I'm getting at is this: I think I know where they're going. The narrator removes the rubber bands from his journal.
SUZY: This is weird.
SAM: I know! Sam takes off his coon-skin cap and throws it aside. Suzy removes her cardigan and drops it on the ground. Sam strips off his uniform down to his white briefs. Suzy take off everything except her underwear and a training bra. They throw their clothes into the water. Sam yells:
SAM: On three! Suzy immediately counts very quickly. They both scream as they leap into the water. They swim toward each other, laughing and shouting.
SUZY: I like it here, but I don't like the Me, neither.
SAM: Me, neither.
SUZY: Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet. It's got no ring to it.
SAM: Let's change it. What should it be?
SUZY: Let me think for a minute. Sam continues to paint while Suzy thinks.
SAM: I made you some jewelry. Sam holds up two dead, shimmering, opalescent beetles with fish-hooks threaded into their shells. Suzy looks enchanted.
SAM: Are your ears pierced?
SUZY: It's pretty. Do the other one. Sam switches to Suzy's other earlobe. She resumes her Sam and Suzy standing on the beach listening to the French singer's record. They face each other, bobbing their heads and tilting awkwardly to the music. Suzy eventually begins to dance. Sam does something vaguely like the Twist. They press against each other and kiss. Suzy says quietly:
SUZY: It feels hard.
SAM: ( EMBARRASSED )
SUZY: I like it.
SAM: ( PAUSE )
SUZY: You can touch my chest. Sam slides his hand up under the training bra and presses it onto Suzy's breast.
SUZY: They're going to grow more. Sam nods. He looks to be in a trance.
SAM: Why do you always use binoculars? Suzy thinks for minute. She says finally:
SUZY: It helps me see things closer. Even if they're not very far away. I pretend it's my magic power.
SAM: ( IMPRESSED )
SAM: What do you want to be? When you grow up.
SUZY: I don't know. I want to go on adventures, I think. Not get stuck in one place. How about you?
SAM: ( PAUSE )
SUZY: That's true.
SAM: It's possible I may wet the bed, by the way. Later, I mean.
SUZY: ( SURPRISED ) ( RELUCTANTLY ) ( SOFTLY )
SAM: ( RELUCTANTLY ) ( SOFTLY )
SUZY: ( SOFTLY )
SAM: Some people frown on these problems. Suzy nods. She holds Sam's hand. She points to the scorpion brooch pinned to Sam's shirt.
SUZY: What's that one for? Sam looks at the brooch. He shakes his head.
SAM: It's not an accomplishment. I inherited it from my mother. It's actually not meant for a male to wear but I don't give a damn. Suzy nods thoughtfully. Pause.
SUZY: Are your foster parents still mad at you? For getting in trouble so much.
SAM: I don't think so. We're getting to know each other better. I feel like I'm in a family now. Not like yours, but similar to one.
SUZY: I always wished I was an orphan. Most of my favorite characters are. I think your lives are more special. Sam frowns. Tears suddenly well-up in his eyes. He shakes his I love you, but you don't know what you're talking about. Long pause. Suzy says genuinely:
SAM: I love you, but you don't know what you're talking about. Long pause. Suzy says genuinely:
SUZY: I love you, too.
SUZY: The flashlight's beam drew a moon through the black across the attic and settled on a gap in the base-board. A mouse-hole, no bigger than a pocket-watch. Eric crouched on his flat feet and placed his hand in front of the tiny opening. "It's windy," he said. "Like someone in there's blowing on my fingers." Christy rolled her eyes and sighed a sigh. He's right again, she thought. Little brothers drive people Suzy looks to Sam to see if he is still awake. Sam nods and signals for Suzy to continue. Suzy turns the page and reads
SUZY: Part Two.
OMIT: CUT TO:
MR. BISHOP: Suzy! Get out here! Mr. Bishop grabs hold of the entire tent by the top and rips it up out of the ground, uprooting the stakes which go flying. This reveals: Sam and Suzy, half-naked, entwined, kissing. Mr. and Mrs. Bishop both freeze. Sam and Suzy look up to them. Mr. Bishop growls and roars at them ferociously like a monster. Sam and Suzy look horrified. Mr. Bishop's face suddenly drains of all emotion. Pause. Mrs. Bishop commands Sam and Suzy:
MRS. BISHOP: Put your clothes on. Both of you. Sam and Suzy remain perfectly still. Mrs. Bishop grabs Suzy by the arm and jerks her to her feet. Sam and Suzy hang onto each other. Mrs. Bishop slaps Suzy with a whack. Sam lets go, and Suzy is gone. Scout Master Ward comes over to Sam sadly and hands him his uniform. Sam takes it. Scout Master Ward turns to the other scouts, claps his hands twice, and says:
SKOTAK: How long were you planning to stay there?
SAM: I don't know.
MURRAY: You said ten days or less.
SUZY: That was a lie.
GADGE: Didn't you ever think about what would happen next?
SAM: Not to my recollection.
LIONEL: You're a traitor to our family.
SUZY: Good. I want to be. Scout Master Ward sits next to Captain Sharp. He shows him the air-mail envelope.
CAPTAIN SHARP: Give him his mail. Scout Master Ward turns to Sam. He holds out the envelope. Sam takes it. He opens it. He reads. Suzy watches him from across the boat. She calls out anxiously:
SUZY: What does it say?
SAM: ( PUZZLED )
SUZY: ( OUTRAGED )
SAM: ( UPSET )
SUZY: Let me read it. Sam holds out the note. Mr. Bishop pulls Suzy back down to her seat. He stands up, himself, and walks over to Sam. He takes him by the wrist and leads him to a small cabin. He opens the door and presses him forward. Sam stumbles down the steps and looks back. Mr. Bishop shuts the door. Captain Sharp glares at him. Suzy says icily:
SUZY: That's child abuse. Mr. Bishop returns to the back of the boat and sits down again. He gives Suzy a direct order:
MR. BISHOP: Be advised: the two of you will never see each other again. Those were your last words. Do you understand?
SUZY: ( DARKLY )
MR. BISHOP: ( HESITATES )
SUZY: ( SIMPLY )
SUZY: I wish I knew what makes you tick.
MR. BISHOP: ( HESITATES )
MRS. BISHOP: Please, terminate this conversation.
MR. BISHOP: ( TO LIONEL )
BECKY: Judy, I have your person-to-person from New Penzance.
CAPTAIN SHARP: Hello? This is Captain Sharp. Social Services flips open a file-folder and picks up a ball- point pen. ( She takes notes throughout the conversation. ) She says into her telephone:
SOCIAL SERVICES: Hello, Captain Sharp. This is Social Services. I'm calling in reference to Sam Shakusky, Ward of the State. I understand he's in your custody.
CAPTAIN SHARP: That's correct.
SOCIAL SERVICES: What's his condition? Has he suffered any injury or trauma of any kind?
CAPTAIN SHARP: He's OK.
SOCIAL SERVICES: Very good. How do I get to you?
CAPTAIN SHARP: The fastest way is by seaplane. Jed can bring you in with the mail.
SOCIAL SERVICES: I'll come tomorrow morning, if that's acceptable to you. Is someone able to
CAPTAIN SHARP: SOCIAL SERVICES
SOCIAL SERVICES: Is that a yes?
CAPTAIN SHARP: SOCIAL SERVICES
SOCIAL SERVICES: Very good. I'll contact you again before the end of the day. Social Services starts to hang up the telephone. Captain Sharp says abruptly:
CAPTAIN SHARP: Wait a second.
SOCIAL SERVICES: ( HESITATES ) CAPTAIN SHARP
CAPTAIN SHARP: Social Services?
SOCIAL SERVICES: ( EVENLY )
CAPTAIN SHARP: ( ANXIOUS )
SOCIAL SERVICES: Well, normally, we'd try to place him in another foster home, but that option is no longer available to us, in my opinion, with his case history which means he'll go to Juvenile Refuge. Captain Sharp exchanges a look with Scout Master Ward. Scout Master Ward interjects:
SOCIAL SERVICES: Who's speaking?
SOCIAL SERVICES: Right. An orphanage but the first step is the admissions panel requires a psychological evaluation to determine whether or not the boy's a candidate for institutional treatment or electroshock therapy. Beyond that
CAPTAIN SHARP: ( INTERRUPTING )
SOCIAL SERVICES: The report describes an assault with That was the girl! Who did that.
CAPTAIN SHARP: ( OBJECTING )
SOCIAL SERVICES: ( PAUSE )
CAPTAIN SHARP: ( LONG PAUSE )
MR. BISHOP: I'll be out back. Lionel, Murray, and Lionel look up from their game. Mr. Bishop hesitates. He seems slightly disoriented.
MR. BISHOP: I'm going to find a tree to chop down. Mr. Bishop exits. Pause. Lionel rolls a pair of dice.
MRS. BISHOP: I do know what you're feeling, Suzy-bean. I've had moments myself where I say: what am I doing here? Who made this decision? How could I allow myself to do something so stupid
REMEMBER: Suzy turns to Mrs. Bishop and interrupts:
SUZY: I hate you.
MRS. BISHOP: ( HESITATES )
SUZY: Why not? I mean it.
MRS. BISHOP: You think you mean it. In this moment. You're trying to hurt me.
SUZY: ( PAUSE )
MRS. BISHOP: He's not dumb, but I guess he is kind of sad. Anyway, we shouldn't discuss that. It's not appropriate for me to even acknowledge what I already just said. Mrs. Bishop sees something sticking out of the leather folder. She pulls it out and stares at it. It is the "Coping with the Very Troubled Child" pamphlet. She looks to Suzy. Suzy looks away. Mrs. Bishop sighs deeply and says, on the verge of tears:
MRS. BISHOP: Poor Suzy. Why is everything so hard for Suzy starts to cry. She covers her face. Her voice breaks as
SUZY: We're in love. We just want to be together. What's wrong with that? Mrs. Bishop puts her arms around Suzy. Suzy shakes, silently sobbing. Mrs. Bishop pulls some twigs and stems out of Suzy's hair. She studies the beetle earrings. She says wearily:
MRS. BISHOP: Oh, my God. How are we going to get these fish-hooks out?
SAM: I admit we knew we'd get in trouble. That part's true. We knew people would be worried, and we still ran away, anyway but something also happened which we didn't do on purpose. When we first met each other. Something happened to us.
CAPTAIN SHARP: I agree with you. That's eloquent. I can't argue against anything you're saying but I don't have to, because you're twelve years old. Captain Sharp brings the skillet to the table and serves three links onto one plate and three onto another. He sits Look, let's face it, you're probably a much more intelligent person than I am. In fact, I guarantee it but even smart kids sometimes stick their fingers in electrical sockets, if you see what I mean. It takes time to figure things out. It's been proven by history: all mankind makes mistakes. It's our job to try to protect you from the dangerous ones. If we can. Captain Sharp pours an inch of beer into a glass and slides it over to Sam.

Captain Sharp pours an inch of beer into a glass and slides it over to Sam.
CAPTAIN SHARP: You want a slug? Sam nods. He and Captain Sharp both drink sips. Captain Sharp asks gently and sincerely:
CAPTAIN SHARP: What's the rush? You've got your whole life in front of yourself. Ahead of you, I mean.
SAM: ( SHRUGS )
CAPTAIN SHARP: ( DEFENSIVE ) ( SADLY )
SAM: ( SADLY )
CAPTAIN SHARP: ( PAUSE )
SAM: What happened?
CAPTAIN SHARP: She didn't love me back.
SAM: Sam considers this. Captain Sharp looks depressed. They start eating their sausages. Captain Sharp says quietly:
CAPTAIN SHARP: I'm sorry for your loss. Anyway, that's what people say.
SAM: CAPTAIN SHARP
CAPTAIN SHARP: What happened?
SAM: A drunk truck driver smashed into them.
CAPTAIN SHARP: ( PAINED )
GADGE: I heard he's going to reform school.
DELUCA: I heard they're going to take out a piece of his brain and send him to an insane I like his girl.
ROOSEVELT: I like his girl.
PANAGLE: She's too scruffy for me.
NICKLEBY: Supposedly, they got to third base.
ROOSEVELT: ( DEEPLY INTRIGUED )
SKOTAK: Damn us. The railing collapses behind Skotak, ripping part of a wall and a row of shingles off the structure as it falls away. There is a moment of silence before it hits the ground with a splintering thud. Skotak hesitates. He moves a half-step away from the edge. He continues:
SKOTAK: This troop has been very shabby to Field Mate Sam Shakusky. In fact, we've been a bunch of mean jerks. Why's he so unpopular? I admit, supposedly, he's
SKOTAK: Nickleby? Deluca? Lazy-Eye? ( from the heart ) Skotak circles around the edge of the tree house. He says
SKOTAK: He's a fellow Khaki Scout, and he needs our help. Are we man enough to give that? So part of his brain doesn't get removed out of him. Skotak stands still. He says mysteriously:
SKOTAK: They were prepared to die for each other out there. Silence. The other scouts begin to murmur to each other, shaking their heads, shrugging, whispering, and gesturing. Finally, Deluca looks up to Skotak.
DELUCA: What do you need?
SKOTAK: ( EXCITED )
CAPTAIN SHARP: In other words, it's over.
MRS. BISHOP: I guess so. For the moment.
CAPTAIN SHARP: Until further notice.
MRS. BISHOP: That's right.
CAPTAIN SHARP: I understand.
MRS. BISHOP: I've got to do better. For everybody.
CAPTAIN SHARP: Except me.
MRS. BISHOP: Except you.
CAPTAIN SHARP: ( SINCERELY )
MRS. BISHOP: Who know what's going to happen, Duffy? I'll probably see you tomorrow.
CAPTAIN SHARP: ( CALMLY )
CAPTAIN SHARP: I admire them, you know? There's a purity to it. I only feel bad because they both seem like such unhappy, lonely, miserable people but maybe that's romantic.
MRS. BISHOP: ( PUZZLED )
SAM: Get out of my chimney.
SKOTAK: Listen to me. We're here for friendship. We're going to get you off this island.
SAM: ( LONG PAUSE )
SKOTAK: Yes, thanks. This is an emergency rescue.
SAM: It's worthless to me. There's no point. Not without Suzy. Skotak gestures for Sam to wait. He disappears from view. A moment later, Suzy's face appears at the top of the chimney, smiling toothily. Sam looks ecstatic.
SAM: How'd you get here?
SUZY: They snuck me down the laundry chute and left a paper-maché dummy in my bed.
SAM: ( IMPRESSED )
SAM: Did you leave another note for Lionel?
SUZY: Not this time. He can't keep his trap shut. Besides, I'll probably never see him again.
SAM: That's true.
NARRATOR: This is the island of St. Jack Wood, extending far north from Land's End along the deep-water channel that leads to Broken Rock. A low flood-plain separates the beach from the town-ship above. A small but prosperous community. The narrator takes out a pocket barometer. He reads it. He
NARRATOR: The barometer reads twenty-seven inches and dropping. Strong winds, as you can see, already at twenty-two knots. ( checks his watch ) The time is now four thirty-five A.M. The narrator walks quickly out of the shot. The five canoes land on the beach with the tide. Sam, Suzy, Skotak, and the rest of the troop quickly jump out and drag the boats up the INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. NIGHT The room is black. Mr. and Mrs. Bishop lie in separate single beds side-by-side. They both stare at the ceiling. The windows rattle, the walls creak, and trees sway outside. Long pause. Mrs. Bishop whispers:
MRS. BISHOP: Did you file the motion for continuance? Peabody vs. Henderson.
MR. BISHOP: It was sustained.
MRS. BISHOP: MR. BISHOP Did the judge consider your application for leniency? Rogers vs. Yentob.
MR. BISHOP: ( PAUSE )
MRS. BISHOP: He granted it.
MR. BISHOP: Silence. Mrs. Bishop's voice breaks as she says quietly:
MRS. BISHOP: I'm sorry, Walt.
MR. BISHOP: It's not your fault. Which injuries are you apologizing for? Specifically.
MRS. BISHOP: Specifically? Whichever ones still hurt.
MR. BISHOP: ( WISTFULLY )
MR. BISHOP: I hope the roof flies off, and I get sucked up into space. You'll be better off without me.
MRS. BISHOP: ( SADLY )
MR. BISHOP: ( PAINED )
MRS. BISHOP: We're all they've got, Walt. Mr. Bishop takes a deep breath. He says finally, with a
MR. BISHOP: It's not enough.
SUZY: " but I'm not going," said Barnaby Jack. "I'm running away tonight for good, and this time I won't get caught." Annabelle whispered: "I'm coming with you." Her yellow hair, now brown at the roots, caught up in the wind and danced. Barnaby Jack took Annabelle's hand and pressed something into it the size of a jellybean. "Hide this in your socks, and be ready at midnight." Suzy looks to Sam to see if he is still awake. Sam looks to the rest of the troop to see if they are still awake. They all nod and signal for Suzy to continue. Suzy turns the page and reads on:
SUZY: He leapt out the window and landed in the fresh-fallen snow.
SECRETARY MCINTIRE: You're not going to believe this one, sir. That Scout Master on New Penzance? Has now lost his entire troop. The seated man whips the towel off his face and rises to his feet. He is Commander Pierce himself. He has silver hair, a moustache, and a much greater number of medals. He says in disbelief as he snatches the slip of paper:
COMMANDER PIERCE: Well, I'll be damned. Who is this bimbo?
SECRETARY MCINTIRE: ( VAGUELY )
GUARD SCOUT: Who's your unit leader? Pause. Nickleby points to a fat man in an apron cooking hamburgers on a grill.
NICKLEBY: That guy. The scout master shrugs. Skotak comes over and says
SKOTAK: There's a broken gum-ball machine behind the snack tent. Skotak distributes a handful of gum-balls among Sam, Suzy, and the rest of the troop. They all put them in their mouths. Skotak motions for everyone to follow him. A footbridge across a stream leads to a Quonset hut with an awning in front labelled Supply Tent. A crowd of very young scouts waits at a wide counter bartering over boxes of food, drink, and equipment. A team of helpers collects money and packages goods. At the center, there is a twenty-year-old
COUSIN BEN: I don't care how they do it where you come from. You want pop? You want candy? You want a snake-bite kit? Get some Skotak appears and whispers something to Cousin Ben. Cousin Ben nods. He says to his customers:
COUSIN BEN: Come back in five minutes. Cousin Ben pulls a curtain shut behind the counter.
COUSIN BEN: Is this him?
SAM: Field Mate Sam Shakusky, Troop 55, He's hot. Almost too hot. What's in the Seventy-six dollars but it's mostly in Give it to me.
COUSIN BEN: He's hot. Almost too hot. What's in the Seventy-six dollars but it's mostly in Give it to me.
SKOTAK: Seventy-six dollars but it's mostly in Give it to me.
COUSIN BEN: Give it to me.
COUSIN BEN: You badge in seamanship?
SAM: Yes, sir. Sam points to one of the patches on his sash. It has an anchor embroidered on it.
COUSIN BEN: Good. There's cold-water crabber moored off Broken Rock. The skipper owes me an I.O.U. We'll see if he can take you on as a claw cracker. It won't be an easy life, but it's better than shock therapy.
SAM: Thank you, sir. By the way, where's the chapel tent? Cousin Ben hesitates. He points behind them with his thumb:
COUSIN BEN: Back there, but the padre's home with the mumps. Why do you ask?
SAM: I want to bring my wife. Cousin Ben stops walking. He looks Sam up and down. Suzy says
SUZY: But we're not married yet. Cousin Ben turns to Suzy. He looks back to Sam and back to Suzy again.
COUSIN BEN: You his girl? Suzy nods. Cousin Ben looks intrigued. He says tentatively:
COUSIN BEN: Technically, I'm a civil-law scrivener. I'm authorized to declare births, deaths, and marriages. You're kind of young. You got a license?
COUSIN BEN: I can't offer you a legally binding union. It won't hold up in the state, the county, or, frankly, any courtroom in the world due to your age, lack of a license, and failure to get parental consent but the ritual does carry a very important moral weight within yourselves. You can't enter into this lightly. Do you love each other? Sam and Suzy immediately nod. Cousin Ben continues:
COUSIN BEN: Are you sure you're ready for this? Sam and Suzy immediately nod. Cousin Ben looks perturbed.
COUSIN BEN: Let me rephrase it.
SUZY: ( INTERRUPTING )
COUSIN BEN: ( SNAPPING )
COUSIN BEN: I don't like the snappy attitude. This is the most important decision you've made in your lives. Now go over by that trampoline and talk it through before you give me another quick answer. Cousin Ben watches as Sam and Suzy walk away and stand next to a large trampoline. A small scout jumps from a high ladder, bounces, and does a back-flip.
SAM: I guess we better try to pretend we're struggling over our decision for a minute before we go back over there and tell him
SUZY: Maybe he's right. It could be a mistake. Sam looks stunned. He is speechless. He stammers:
SAM: What? Why? How?
SUZY: Being married. Sometimes it seems sad to me. It might be better to just go steady Sam shakes his head. He looks off into the distance. He says
SAM: I don't know what to say.
COUSIN BEN: I guess they're probably just trying to pretend they're struggling over their decision, but at least
SKOTAK: Cousin Ben looks. Suzy has her hands around Sam's throat and is throttling him. Sam squirms loose and calms her down. The troop watches transfixed. Sam takes a snapshot out of his pocket and shows it to Suzy, explaining. Suzy nods. They come back over to the group. There are tears on Suzy's cheeks. She says to Cousin Ben:
SUZY: We're sure.
COUSIN BEN: OK. Let's do a blood test.
COUSIN BEN: which we hereby consecrate on this day, the fifth of September, 1965.
COUSIN BEN: Can we loan them the nickels? I'm worried about their future.
SKOTAK: Can we loan them the nickels? I'm worried about their future.
COUSIN BEN: ( OFFENDED )
NICKLEBY: What's going to happen to them?
GADGE: Nobody knows.
DELUCA: Let's take a vote.
SKOTAK: All in favor
COUSIN BEN: ( LOUDLY )
COUSIN BEN: You're just like your brothers. OK, give them the tennis ball can. Cousin Ben points to the tennis ball can on the floor next to his feet. Skotak takes it and zips it into a side-pocket of
COUSIN BEN: Sign here and initial here and here. Sam and Suzy sign and initial. Cousin Ben tears out a copy.
COUSIN BEN: Take the carbon. Leave the Bible. Let's Sam and Suzy turn and walk out of the chapel tent holding hands. They do not smile. Cousin Ben, Skotak, and the rest of the troop follow them with grave expressions on their faces. Sam touches Suzy's hair. Suzy kisses Sam's hand. They walk as a group through the camp.
OMIT: EXT. CAMP MARINA. DAY Sam, Suzy, Skotak, and the rest of the troop wait at the end of a narrow dock. Cousin Ben stands below them in a small sailboat. He reaches up to Suzy and lifts her onboard. He reaches up to Sam and lifts him onboard, too. He rigs the Sam smiles sadly. He and Skotak do the secret handshake. The others quickly join in. Suzy blows them a kiss. Everyone looks choked up. Cousin Ben unloops a line. The sails quickly catch the strong wind, and the boat sails away into the harbor. Skotak and the rest of troop wave and salute. They watch, bittersweet.
NICKLEBY: Where they going again?
GADGE: He's going to work on a shrimper, if I understand correctly.
SKOTAK: ( WISTFULLY )
ROOSEVELT: I think they're coming back. Skotak and the rest of the troop stop and turn around. The sailboat glides back in. Sam leaps onto the dock with the tennis ball can. Suzy looks worried. Cousin Ben yells:
COUSIN BEN: Be quick, sailor!
SKOTAK: ( PUZZLED )
SAM: ( QUICKLY )
DELUCA: ( SHRUGS )
SAM: We can't. It's her magic power!
SAM: You killed your dog, by the way.
REDFORD: ( HESITATES ) ( SHRUGS )
SAM: Why do you consider me your enemy? Redford frowns. He says in disbelief:
REDFORD: Because your girlfriend stabbed me in the back with lefty scissors.
SAM: She's my wife now.
REDFORD: I'm saying before that. Six weeks ago. From day one. What'd I do wrong? I'm trying to understand.
SAM: I'm saying before that. Six weeks ago. From day one. What'd I do wrong? I'm trying to understand.
REDFORD: ( LONG PAUSE )
REDFORD: He's here! The fugitive! Stop him! An emergency alarm sounds. The entire camp swings into action. Two teams of scouts playing capture-the-flag descend from both sides and cut Sam off from the dock. They wear red and yellow jerseys over their uniforms. Suzy jumps out of the boat onto the dock. Sam sees her beyond the blockade of scouts. She waves her arms. Sam throws up his hands. He sprints in a new direction, onto a wide field. There is a small, pink flag on a thin stick stuck in the ground at the center of a plastic ring. Sam grabs it as he runs past. He looks back and sees:
SAM: I'm OK. Suzy helps Sam to his feet. Sam raises Suzy's smoldering binoculars to his eyes. Skotak and the rest of the troop join A binocular shot of a ladder leaning against a high fence.
SAM: Follow me! Sam leads Suzy, Skotak, and the rest of the troop fly at a sprint to the fence, climb the ladder, and pull it up after them. A bugle plays a cavalry charge. The mob bolts after Split-screen. On one side of the frame, we see Captain Sharp, Scout Master Ward, and Becky wearing their operator head- phones. On the other side, we see Commander Pierce, Secretary McIntire, and the commander's entourage inside the command tent. Commander Pierce says into his field-telephone:
COMMANDER PIERCE: Captain Sharp, we've located the missing troop. They just fled camp. We're in
CAPTAIN SHARP: Stand by, Commander Pierce. Captain Sharp spins around in his chair and flips a switch on a two-way radio. He says into a microphone:
CAPTAIN SHARP: Jed, re-route to St. Jack Wood. Tell Social Services the boy's been spotted at Fort Lebanon.
CAPTAIN SHARP: Becky, notify the Bishops: Suzy's there. Becky nods. Captain Sharp turns to Scout Master Ward.
CAPTAIN SHARP: Randy? You monitoring? Scout Master Ward is already on his feet. He peels off his SCOUT MASTER WARD Affirmative. I'm on my way. Becky plugs a cord into a socket and says:
BECKY: Hello! Mr. Bishop? Captain Sharp looks out the window with a sense of dread.
MR. BISHOP: Oh, dear God. Mr. Bishop grabs Mrs. Bishop by the wrist. He says grimly:
MR. BISHOP: Get the boys.
MRS. BISHOP: Let's go! Right now!
JED: Tower control, this is Jed. Confirm co- ordinates for new destination: alpha-two- two-seven-one-fiver. Looking pretty soupy up here. Wouldn't mind setting down before the pot boils over. ( to Social Services ) Hang on, Social Services. Jed presses the yoke forward, and the plane dips hard. Social Services braces against the dash.
SECRETARY MCINTIRE: That's coming our way. Captain Pierce nods, worried. The capture-the-flag scouts in soaking jerseys gather, winded, outside the tent. One of the team captains stands in the entrance breathing heavily. Commander Pierce points to him:
COMMANDER PIERCE: You find them?
TEAM CAPTAIN: No, sir.
COMMANDER PIERCE: ( to the entourage ) Prepare to mobilize to higher ground. Secretary McIntire hands Commander Pierce an envelope with red-and-white stripes on it. Commander Pierce rips it open.
COMMANDER PIERCE: St. Jack Church is the designated storm ( to Secretary McIntire ) Notify all scouts to muster outside my tent on the double.

COMMANDER PIERCE: Attention, company! Prepare for Commander Pierce hesitates. He points down to the marina and says to Secretary McIntire:
COMMANDER PIERCE: Who's that? Secretary McIntire and the commander's entourage turn to see: Scout Master Ward speeding toward the dock in his motorboat. He leaps to shore, throws a line over a post, and sprints up to the assembly. He salutes Commander Pierce. Commander Pierce frowns and asks with quiet ferocity:
COMMANDER PIERCE: You call yourself a Khaki Scout?
COMMANDER PIERCE: ( ENRAGED )
COMMANDER PIERCE: ( DISGUSTED )
SECRETARY MCINTIRE: ( IN EXPLANATION )
COMMANDER PIERCE: I'm field-stripping you of your command. Commander Pierce rips the patch off Scout Master Ward's uniform and throws it aside. He holds out his hand, palm up. Scout Master Ward looks stricken. He reaches into his pocket, takes out his scout pocket-knife, and hands it Commander Pierce. Commander Pierce puts it into his own pocket. He
COMMANDER PIERCE: Attention, company! Prepare for emergency Secretary McIntire leans close to Commander Pierce. He
SECRETARY MCINTIRE: Sir, do you have your medicine? Commander Pierce hesitates. He holds up a finger.
COMMANDER PIERCE: I'll be right back. Commander Pierce strides back into the command tent. Secretary McIntire looks to Scout Master Ward, uneasy. Scout Master Ward stares down at the ground. The flash-flood explodes out from the woods. Gushing water pours down the hillside, cuts a swath through the center of the camp, and tears down everything in its narrow path. The command tent suddenly becomes a tiny island at the center of a rushing river.
SECRETARY MCINTIRE: All accounted for, Scout Master!
COUSIN BEN: Affirmative, sir!
CAPTAIN SHARP: Who's in charge here? Another side door opens. Scout Master Ward jogs in with Commander Pierce still over his shoulders and the entire company behind him flooding into the room. Captain Sharp yells to him:
CAPTAIN SHARP: Randy! What happened? Scout Master Ward goes over to Captain Sharp and turns his back to him, jogging in place.
MR. BISHOP: Suzy? Sam?
BECKY: Are you all right?
SOCIAL SERVICES: Where's the boy? Captain Sharp hesitates. He says reluctantly:
CAPTAIN SHARP: We don't know yet.
SOCIAL SERVICES: That's not acceptable.
CAPTAIN SHARP: ( pretending to be irritated ) What do you want me to say, lady? ( to no one in particular ) Somebody get Jed a cup of coffee. The acolyte runs to the coffee dispenser with a cardboard cup. Social Services charges over to Captain Sharp.
SOCIAL SERVICES: You're Captain Sharp?
CAPTAIN SHARP: That's right.
SOCIAL SERVICES: I'm Social Services. I remanded the boy to your personal custody. You're responsible for his safety. I'm told he was just struck by lightning. Captain Sharp frowns. He looks to Scout Master Ward and says
CAPTAIN SHARP: That's the first I heard of it.
SOCIAL SERVICES: Scout Master Ward, I presume?
SOCIAL SERVICES: ( BITINGLY )
SOCIAL SERVICES: You two are the most appallingly incompetent custodial guardians Social Services has ever had the misfortune to
ENCOUNTER: ( SHOUTING )
SOCIAL SERVICES: What do you have to say for yourselves? Captain Sharp hesitates. He says strangely:
CAPTAIN SHARP: You can't do this. They'll eat him alive in there.
SOCIAL SERVICES: ( HESITATES ) CAPTAIN SHARP
CAPTAIN SHARP: ( aside, to Scout Master Ward ) What's the name of the place again?
CAPTAIN SHARP: ( HORRIFIED )
SOCIAL SERVICES: Just find the boy and deliver him ( motioning to herself ) to Social Services. Nothing else is in your power.
MR. BISHOP: ( SHARPLY )
MR. BISHOP: Can we get back to the rescue now?
MRS. BISHOP: ( URGENTLY )
SOCIAL SERVICES: ( FROWNING )
SOCIAL SERVICES: The parents of the stabber?
MRS. BISHOP: I object to that description. She was Commander Pierce appears with an oxygen mask over his face. He pulls it aside briefly and says to Secretary McIntire:
COMMANDER PIERCE: I want the details. Where's the scout she Right here. Secretary McIntire snaps his fingers and gives a signal. Redford appears.
SECRETARY MCINTIRE: Right here. Secretary McIntire snaps his fingers and gives a signal. Redford appears.
REDFORD: Field Mate Redford, sir.
COMMANDER PIERCE: ( through the oxygen mask ) What's his condition?
SECRETARY MCINTIRE: He may suffer some limited chronic kidney insufficiency. Here's the report. Secretary McIntire hands Commander Pierce a doctor's report. Mrs. Bishop snatches it and throws it over her shoulder.
MRS. BISHOP: We don't have time for this!
SOCIAL SERVICES: Let's go! Social Services turns and starts up the aisle. She stops suddenly. Captain Sharp is standing in their path brandishing Panagle's walking stick weapon.
CAPTAIN SHARP: Nobody's going anywhere. Everyone stops. Captain Sharp locks eyes with Social Services. He says in a steely voice:
CAPTAIN SHARP: He's not getting shock therapy.

CAPTAIN SHARP: Where'd they go? Answer me! Skotak hesitates. He and the rest of the troop all look up to a small, rickety, attic door. It is slightly ajar above a long, narrow ladder behind the pipes of the organ. Captain Sharp bolts up the steps. Everyone follows him, EXT. CHURCH ROOF. NIGHT The storm rages. Captain Sharp opens a trap door onto the high eaves. Faces appear in numerous windows below, looking up. Mr. and Mrs. Bishop poke their heads out behind Captain Sharp. On the far end of the rooftop, Sam and Suzy huddle together at the base of the high steeple. Captain Sharp stares up at Sam and Suzy, dumbstruck. Sam and Suzy quickly start climbing a rusty gutter up the side of the steeple. Captain Sharp looks astonished. He
CAPTAIN SHARP: Halt! Stop! Sam and Suzy continue to climb. Captain Sharp shouts back to Mr. and Mrs. Bishop over the roaring wind:
CAPTAIN SHARP: Stay there! Scout Master Ward appears and thrusts out the coil of rope. He yells to Captain Sharp:
CAPTAIN SHARP: Where you going? What are you doing? Come Captain Sharp rubs his eyes. He knots one end of the rope around his waist and ties the other to a pipe at the foot of the gutter. He pulls the rope tight, presses his foot on the wall, and gets ready to start climbing then stops suddenly. He hesitates. He pulls the walkie-talkie off his belt and yells into it:
CAPTAIN SHARP: Social Services? Do you read me? Over!
SUZY: We might have to swim for it.
SAM: How deep is it? I didn't bring my life I don't know, but if it's too shallow, we'll break our necks, anyway. Hang onto Sam and Suzy link arms.
SUZY: I don't know, but if it's too shallow, we'll break our necks, anyway. Hang onto Sam and Suzy link arms.

SUZY: I think you've still got lightning in Let's jump. Sam and Suzy look down at the water again. Captain Sharp's voice screams from off-screen:

CAPTAIN SHARP: Sam and Suzy retreat slightly. Captain Sharps waves his hands in surrender. He yells into the walkie-talkie:
CAPTAIN SHARP: Tell him! Over! Captain Sharp holds out the walkie-talkie. Social Services voice comes over the scratchy speaker once more. She shouts:
SOCIAL SERVICES: Is this acceptable to you, Mr. Shakusky?
CAPTAIN SHARP: What do you think, pal? Tears stream down Sam's cheeks in the rain. He looks to Suzy. She nods. She holds Sam's hand, and Sam reaches out to take Captain Sharp's. Captain Sharp says into the walkie-talkie:
CAPTAIN SHARP: We're coming down! Over and out.
CAPTAIN SHARP: Don't let go.
