"MINORITY REPORT": Aug 15th 1997 rewrite by Jon Cohen
DARKNESS: And then, slowly emerging from the mists of darkness, a pale, beautifully proportioned FACE. The oval face is female, a woman of indeterminate age, her features as fragile as porcelain. Her eyes are closed in sleep, or in death . or in something in between. Now TWO MORE FACES emerge out of the darkness. They are male, and they float into position on either side of the female. They are just as ethereally beautiful, just as pale, and like the female their eyes are closed. The ghostly lips of the female begin to twitch. Her features, which have been expressionless, suddenly contort, mask-like, into the face of a woman in fear. Her eyes open. The male face on her right contorts too. His features warp into an angry snarl the mask of a man enraged. His eyes The male face on her left takes on the expression of a young boy, a boy who is terribly frightened. His eyes open wide. As if they are lost in the same terrible waking dream, a sudden and unnerving exchange begins .
FEMALE: ( frightened woman )
JOHNNY, PLEASE: MALE RIGHT
MALE RIGHT: ( mocking man ) "Johnny, please. Johnny please."
FEMALE: You're scaring me.
MALE LEFT: ( child's voice )
MALE RIGHT: ( considering ) I don't like you any more, Carol.
FEMALE: ( imploring ) Put the scissors down. You're scaring me. Please.
MALE RIGHT: Oh, Carol.
FEMALE: Johnny! Stop!
MALE RIGHT: Don't grab at me! Let
MALE LEFT: Daddy! No!
ALL THREE: The faces linger a moment, the weary eyes slowly close, and the dark reaches forth, and takes them.
OUTSIDE: The girl careens gleefully into the middle of the street.
OUTSIDE: The little girl picks up her red ball, as the Chevy bears down on her.
THE STREET: The car has stopped, inches from the girl. The girl giggles as, the man in the car gives her a big wink. She waves, then runs back to the sidewalk with her red ball.
JOHNNY: ( gruff ) Why'd you let me sleep so long?
CAROL: It's Saturday, Johnny, you always Why are you staring at me like that?
JOHNNY: I'm unhappy that you let me sleep so
CLOSE: ON - A GLOVE The glove is a weapon of some kind, the elongated index finger ending in an open barrel. Clearly, this is not, as it first seemed, the past not America in the 1950's. It is the neo-past, the retro world of America 2040, where the familiar of yesterday is intermeshed with hypertechnology. And all of that hypertechnology is focused on JOHNNY, as he makes a run for the house, sheets of newspaper scattering behind him. He bursts up the front porch, shoving Carol out of the way. Eight Precrime police officers assemble in the yard. From a backpack, one of them quickly removes an instrument with a handle grip and an ovoid screen. It is a holographic scanner. He activates it, scans the OFFICER in front of him, and an IDENTICAL POLICE OFFICER takes three-dimensional form. The two real officers circle the house, repeating the maneuver a dozen times. In less than a minute, a decoy force of men three dimensional, standing in place, but shifting and turning like living beings has been created. An overwhelming police deterrent presence has been established.
UPSTAIRS HALLWAY: Two OFFICERS, standing back-to-back, hold their gloved hands out in front of them, palm out. When the first officer points his palm toward a door at the end of the hallway, his glove BEEPS softly.
THE BEDROOM: The room is packed with police how many are real?
THE CLOSET: Johnny squirms, his pajamas saturated with sweat. He calls out through the door.
JOHNNY: I didn't do anything!
OFFICER 1: Come out of the closet on your hands and knees.
OFFICER 1: Hands and knees!
JOHNNY: I didn't. officer nods affirmatively to the other officer.
OFFICER 2: POSITIVE FOR JOHN PALMER. John Palmer, if you were being arrested for any other crime, I would now read you your rights. But you are under arrest for the future murderer of your wife, Carol Palmer. You have no rights.
OFFICER 1: ( to Johnny ) John Palmer, if you were being arrested for any other crime, I would now read you your rights. ( beat ) But you are under arrest for the future murderer of your wife, Carol Palmer. You have no rights.
WITWER: Thought we might a had a runner.
ANDERSON: Yeah, a runner.
WITWER: A little chase that'd been good.
ANDERSON: Fifty cops on the scene takes the chase out of them.
WITWER: ( smiles ) But only eight of us were real.
ANDERSON: We ever get a runner, I'd be too old to give chase.
WITWER: You'd chase. You'd love it,. Man.
ANDERSON: I love it more Johnny boy doesn't get to murder his wife.
WITWER: ( beat ) It's a beautiful world.
LISA: Jesus, Paul. Your heart's hammering. I excite you that much? I used to love being a cop.
ANDERSON: I used to love being a cop.
LISA: You're still a cop. I'm a factory worker. We don't catch murderers. We process them.
LISA: You're the best homicide cop in the
ANDERSON: Great except there's no such thing as homicide. What I do best doesn't exist anymore.
LISA: ( beat ) You're the Director of a perfect system. A Cop with a perfect record
ANDERSON: They identify the accused I just put on my monkey suit and go round them up.
LISA: And then go to jail. And lives are saved. Thousands of lives. And that's a cop's dream.
ANDERSON: No. You're a cop's dream.
ANDERSON: Cocks his head, then goes back to toweling off.
ANDERSON: Who called?
LISA: No one. I called about my hair. Getting it done this afternoon.
ANDERSON: Come on in, neighbor. Want some
FRANK D'IGNAZIO: Brought these for your supper.
LISA: Oh, Frank. That's so sweet. Thank Sweet, nothing. I gotta get rid of these things. One plant, and I'm invaded by tomatoes. When I was a kid .
FRANK D'IGNAZIO: Sweet, nothing. I gotta get rid of these things. One plant, and I'm invaded by tomatoes. When I was a kid .
ANDERSON: Before all this genetically engineered crap .
FRANK D'IGNAZIO: Yeah well, it's true. It used to be a challenge to grow things. An art. Now you put one plant in the ground then jump the hell out of the
ANDERSON: FRANK D'IGNAZIO
FRANK D'IGNAZIO: Nah, thanks. Can't stay. You guys are rushing off to work anyway.
LISA: You and Ellie come for supper then.
ANDERSON: We'll barbecue.
FRANK D'IGNAZIO: You betcha. We'll bring some more tomatoes a new batch will have grown by then.
INTERCOM VOICE: Yes, Director Anderson?
ANDERSON: Where's Ennis Page? Why hasn't he delivered this morning's Precog discs? I'll find him, sir.
INTERCOM VOICE: I'll find him, sir.
WITWER: Bullying the staff again, Director Screw you.
ANDERSON: Screw you.
WITWER: The Johnny Palmer bust?
ANDERSON: It was okay. We got our man.
WITWER: It was okay. We got our man.
ANDERSON: When do we
PAGE: Sorry I'm late, sir. Precogs put out a heavy national volume this morning four for our zone.
ANDERSON: ( DISTRACTED )
ANDERSON: Thanks, Ennis.
WITWER: Now that's a guy who
VIDEO SCREEN: A young black woman stands in a hallway. She stares at a door, gun in hand. She opens the door, enters a bedroom. She glides toward a bed, where a man lies sleeping. She lifts the gun and fires it into his sleeping form. ANDERSON pops the disc, jots down some notes, pops in a new VIDEO SCREEN A white woman stands at a stove, cooking. A man comes up behind her slowly, silently, a necktie taut between his hands. He raises the necktie toward her neck
VIDEO SCREEN: A white woman stands at a stove, cooking. A man comes up behind her slowly, silently, a necktie taut between his hands. He raises the necktie toward her neck
ANDERSON: He's not watching the screen. He is out of his chair now, looking out the window.
TOUR GUIDE: Welcome to the main headquarters of Precrime. Smaller Precrime branches are scattered throughout the United
MR. HARRIS: Three. Uh, right?
TOUR GUIDE: That's exactly right! A lot of people assume there are Precogs in every branch office.
TIMMY: They protect us.
TOUR GUIDE: ( chipper voice ) That's right, Timmy. Because of the Precogs, you're going to grow up murderfree. Isn't that something?
MR. HARRIS: They ever wrong? The Precogs ever screw up when they predict a murder?
TOUR GUIDE: system. The Precogs predict a homicide, and our Precrime police then apprehend that future murderer before the event occurs. And right next door is the Judicial Center, where we prosecute the future murderers.
TIMMY: Can we see the Precogs?
TOUR GUIDE: No, I'm sorry. That part of the building is not open to the public. Now, if you'll just step this way
ANDERSON: What would they think about if we unhooked them?
PAGE: They don't think, sir. They just
LISA: Director Anderson, do you swear that the disc you now present to the court is the only and authentic disc of the future murder of Carol Palmer by her husband, John Palmer?
ANDERSON: Yes. This is the only and authentic disc of the event seen by the Precognitive mutants and recorded by the Precrime Division. This is the immutable evidence of the infallible The murder of Carol Palmer will occur
LISA: The murder of Carol Palmer will occur
ANDERSON: In one week June 16th, 2040 at 10:33 in the morning.
THE MONITOR: The Palmer's family room. Johnny reaches into Carol's sewing basket for the scissors. Carol stands defenseless in front of him. Their son cowers in a corner of the room.
CAROL: Johnny, please
JOHNNY: "Johnny, please. Johnny please."
CAROL: You're scaring me.
JOHNNY'S SON: DADDY, DON'T. DADDY
JOHNNY: ( considering ) I don't like you any more, Carol.
CAROL: ( imploring ) Put the scissors down. You're scaring me. Please.
JOHNNY: I didn't do it. I'm innocent! It didn't happen!
JUDGE: How does the defense plead?
DEFENSE ATTORNEY: The defense acknowledges the infallibility of the system. We are Guilty. We throw ourselves at the mercy of the court.
JOHNNY: No! No! The Precogs are wrong! No!
WITWER: ( to Anderson ) Looks like the old days.
ANDERSON: That would be bad news for an infallible system.
WITWER: We know it can't be a murder the Precogs would've seen it. Why do you insist on coming to these things?
ANDERSON: Keeps the system honest. And besides, I like to pretend I'm a cop.
OFFICER: Right here, sir.
ANDERSON: Hi DOC.
HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR: Hello, Director Anderson.
WITWER: This a homicide, Doc?
HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR: I'm presently analyzing neurohormones, Assistant Director Witwer. I have not concluded my examination.
WITWER: Bingo. The guy put the gun to his own head.
HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR: I have not determined that yet, Assistant Director.
WITWER: You have good ears for a ghost, Doc.
HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR: Please rotate the corpse to the lateral supine position.
WITWER: Can you imagine if this homicide? Who even knows how to hunt down a killer any more?
ANDERSON: Easy, partner. But you know what I'm saying. The state legislatures are pushing to stop funding for training homicide detectives .
WITWER: Easy, partner. But you know what I'm saying. The state legislatures are pushing to stop funding for training homicide detectives .
ANDERSON: God bless the Precogs.
HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR: This event is a negative homicide. A mortal wound was generated by a .22 calibre bullet self-delivered to the parietal 'portion of the skull on June 10th, 2040, at 11:57 pm,
WITWER: It's time to stop coming to these, Yeah. You're right.
ANDERSON: Yeah. You're right.
ANDERSON: A little bit of me dies every time I come to one of these things.
LISA: It's only a party, Paul.
ANDERSON: I'd never have let them appoint me to Precrime if I'd have known this was going to be part of it.
LISA: You're exactly what Precrime needed. An amazing homicide cop and a real person in an unreal job.
ANDERSON: The public loves the
LISA: The public loves the
ANDERSON: Let's invite all these irregular assholes over for a barbecue. Burgers and beer - think they'd come?
SENATOR MALCOLM: make all the other assholes come with me.
SENATOR MALCOLM: I have a dream, Paul.
ANDERSON: I know you do, Senator.
SENATOR MALCOLM: Hundreds of Precogs. Not just predicting murders, but predicting all crimes. Burglary, arson, assaults
ANDERSON: How about jaywalking? Littering? Now there's a crime.
SENATOR MALCOLM: I don't want a police state, you know that. But we have an opportunity here, and
ANDERSON: No sir, we opportunity. There are only three Precogs. They're a lucky accident of nature. There are no more.
SENATOR MALCOLM: ( beat ) We can make more. Just give me your support. Help me increase funding for the Precog Engineering Project.
ANDERSON: Precogs aren't sheep or pigs. Seeing into the future is a gift, a nonreproducible event.
SENATOR MALCOLM: Fuck Mozart. The people want to be safe. They want that more than they want food or love.
ANDERSON: Senator, a world filled with hundreds of Precogs is not my idea of a safe
SENATOR MALCOLM: Sure could use your help, Paul.
ANDERSON: I decline, Senator. I'm sorry.
SENATOR MALCOLM: ( icily ) Don't think I'll come to your barbecue after all.
DR. RESFIELD: You don't get out here much.
ANDERSON: Not my sort of place.
DR. RESFIELD: The head of Precrime squeamish?
ANDERSON: When it comes to needles and scalpels, I promise we won't use any on you.
DR. RESFIELD: I promise we won't use any on you.
ANDERSON: DR. RESFIELD ( beat )
DR. RESFIELD: ( beat ) On bits of this and that.
ANDERSON: What's happening here?
DR. RESFIELD: We're in an interesting phase.
ANDERSON: What's in the cylinders?
DR. RESFIELD: From .?
ANDERSON: From .?
DR. RESFIELD: A fusion of sources. From the Precogs' deceased mother. From the Precogs themselves.
ANDERSON: A fusion of . ?
DR. RESFIELD: In lay terms, we mated sperm from the brothers with ova from the mother and sister to create new growth.
FRANK D'IGNAZIO: What are you doing, playing hooky?
ANDERSON: It's great out here, Frank.. You got the touch.
FRANK D'IGNAZIO: I got the arthritis, is what I got.
ANDERSON: Sure, Frank. Yeah.
FRANK D'IGNAZIO: ( distracted ) I thought I'd buried it all. Thirty-five years all those minutes and days to bury it. ( beat ) But suddenly you see the man who murdered your daughter walking the streets my God it throws you.
ANDERSON: He'd served his time, Frank. I know it's not fair. It's way beyond not fair .
FRANK D'IGNAZIO: ( yells ) God damn the Precogs. You know? Why couldn't they have been around to save my girl? ( softly ) Now they're catching me.
ANDERSON: Next Wednesday, at noon.
FRANK D'IGNAZIO: Anderson's cop eyes are all over the gun.
ANDERSON: It's not in you, Frank, to kill Tell it to the Precogs. It's set in stone now, right?
FRANK D'IGRAZIO: Tell it to the Precogs. It's set in stone now, right?
FRANK D'IGNAZIO: ( almost inaudible ) I don't want to be a part of this world anymore.
ANDERSON: I know, Frank.
FRANK D'IGNAZIO: ( beat ) So. Tell me, Paul. Do the Precogs see everything?
ANDERSON: FRANK D'IGRAZIO
FRANK D'IGRAZIO: Then they won't have seen this.
WITWER: ( GENTLY )
ANDERSON: ( angrily ) You blame him? The guy killed his
WITWER: Precrime did the job it was supposed to do.
WITWER: It's not easy. It beats us down. Ellie in there no doubt she hates you right now.
ANDERSON: That's why I got into this business to be hated.
WITWER: They hated us when we were regular cops. Now we're Precrime, and they still hate US. It's one of the little perks of law enforcement nobody knows
THE MONITOR: shows Anderson and Witwer in a room, a few feet apart pointing guns directly at each other. Their eyes intense and panicked. Who murders whom? Ed's eyes cut to a huge digital clock on the wall as the red seconds tumble away.
ANDERSON: Oh, Ed .
ALL THREE: After a long moment, the eyes close again, and the Precogs fade into the mists .
ANGELA: She hesitates before fully entering the room, Anderson grabs at the incriminating disc. He sees his EYES reflected in its alloy surface. He pushes the disc deep into his pants Somehow he finds his voice.
ANDERSON: Come in. Angela.
ANGELA: Need you to sign these. And your eleven o'clock starts in five minutes.
ANDERSON: My . eleven.
ANGELA: ( beat ) Budget coordination with the FBI. ( beat ) You okay, sir?
ANDERSON: Have Page take this.
ANGELA: But sir, the procedure
ANGELA: Yes sir.
ANDERSON: I'll speak to Witwer, put him in charge for the rest of the day.
WITWER: Breaking and entering. That'll get you five to ten, hard.
WITWER: Anderson's hand comes out of his pocket, EMPTY.
ANDERSON: Take over for me today?
WITWER: You sick?
ANDERSON: Witwer makes a show of backing away.
WITWER: Don't give it to me. You probably have that Trans-10 virus going around. A stomach thing. I hate stomach
ANDERSON: Witwer looks at him. Anderson almost reaches out for him.
WITWER: Witwer looks at him. Anderson almost reaches out for him.
ANDERSON: Run the place, okay?
WITWER: ( smiles ) Sure. Right into the ground. ( beat ) Go on home before I call Infectious Control and have them spray you down with something. You want me to do the discs, or hold them for you to review when you get Can't let them back up. Do 'em.
ANDERSON: Can't let them back up. Do 'em.
WITWER: Call you later. Take it easy, all
LISA: Listen to me.
ANDERSON: Listen to me.
LISA: I can hardly hear you.
ANDERSON: I'm underground. Weakens the signal so it can't be picked up.
LISA: But we're on Secure
ANDERSON: Listen, dammit! I'm going to murder
LISA: Paul. Paul His crackling voice faintly comes through the phone.
ANDERSON'S VOICE: . home.
POLICE OFFICER: Hello, sir.
ANDERSON: What's your name, officer?
POLICE OFFICER: Bob, uh, Robert Smythe.
ANDERSON: These the new Python transports?
ANDERSON: Don't move.
LISA: It's a hundred degrees in here.
ANDERSON: I turned the furnace all the way up. Your hair dryer. The oven. If they come, it'll buy me twenty seconds. Maybe thirty.
LISA: Nobody's coming for you.
ANDERSON: I'm going to kill Ed Witwer.
LISA: Anderson's right hand hangs over the side of his armchair. We see the bright DISC cupped in the palm. He seems about to reveal it to her, but doesn't, yet. He keeps staring at her intently. Something is holding him back.
ANDERSON: One week from today. Tuesday, June 25, at five-twenty in the morning. I shoot him, Lisa.
LISA: ( beat ) You need to take time off.
ANDERSON: You don't have to worry about that.
LISA: ( gently ) I want to hold you.
ANDERSON: If you love me, stand there. And don't move.
LISA: The Precogs are emit a single disc. "The immutable evidence of the infallible system."
ANDERSON: The Precogs are emit a single disc. "The immutable evidence of the infallible system."
LISA: We'll figure this out. We'll review the system.
ANDERSON: There is no review. There's only the disc. It Shows My guilt. There's no defense.
LISA: You can't run. Please, let's
ANDERSON: Last week. It was strange. I watched from the bathroom window. You went out in the backyard to make a call.
LISA: Stop it! Paul, please. You're panicking. Everything's going to look wrong. You're going to distrust everybody and everything now.
ANDERSON: Ed. why outside? Why lie about it?
LISA: Stop being a cop and listen to me!
LISA: Your birthday's tomorrow! We wanted
LISA: They move past her and spread through the rooms and up the
UPSTAIRS: Helmeted officers hold their gloved right bands palm out, scanning rooms for thermal presence. An OFFICER 1 steps out of a small room. He speaks, his voice electronically altered.
OFFICER 1: He's got a hair dryer going. Screwed up my reading.
OFFICER 2: We're not picking up shit.
OUTSIDE: Everywhere else in the neighborhood it is green and calm. But Anderson's house looks like a wasps's nest someone has kicked. Four Precrime hovercrafts are suspended above it, engines WHINING. Black Python transports are all over the street out in front, and more keep coming. And everywhere on foot, there are Precrime police. OFFICER I approaches a Python ground transport. Another officer guards it, weapon out, his head turning right to left. He settles on OFFICER 1's approach and raises his weapon. OFFICER 1 doesn't even break stride. He walks right up to the guard and then right through him. A holograph decoy. OFFICER 1 enters the Python.
VOICE: Paul Anderson 0256 clear.
VOICE: Enter now please, Assistant Director
CIA CRONIN: The central question is: Why does Anderson want to kill Witwer?
FBI SWANSON: Personnel checks reveal no ambitious coups planned by you to topple him. He's done nothing to you, or you to
WITWER: FBI SWANSON
FBI SWANSON: HIS MOTHER? HIS BROTHER?
JUSTICE POLLARD: So, you are friends, partners, and soul mates. Anderson has no motive.
WITWER: I can't think of one. Maybe JUSTICE POLLARD The Precogs are mistaken?
JUSTICE POLLARD: You don't believe that, do you?
WITWER: ( barely audible ) No. The Precogs are infallible.
SENATOR MALCOLM: You're goddam right. So, gentlemen -screw the motive. We got a pre-murderer on the run, and a nasty little PR problem.
WITWER: Cronin talks right over him.
CIA CRONIN: The public must believe that every future murderer is pursued with equal Therefore, Precrime will put in charge the man best suited to the job. And who would pursue a murderer harder . than his intended victim?
FBI SWANSON: Therefore, Precrime will put in charge the man best suited to the job. And who would pursue a murderer harder . than his intended victim?
JUSTICE POLLARD: You went after Anderson yesterday -because it was right, and because you believe.
JUSTICE POLLARD: Haw long will it take, Director?
WITWER: He knows Precrime, of course. And the streets he's rusty, but he'll remember how to work them. It'll come back to him fast. He's . the
JUSTICE POLLARD: We're not here to praise Caesar we're here to bury him.
WITWER: He can't avoid iris identification. Every door he opens, every ATM he uses, or taxi or transport he boards he'll get scanned. It won't take long to find him.
TECHNICIAN: It's Anderson.
WITWER: The technicians scramble to pinpoint Anderson on a Glowing holographic MAP.
TECHNICIAN 2: He's been Scanned. He's on the 33rd Street Subway!
TECHNICIAN: His cell phone tracks for The Sprawl. We got him on the Subway, too!
ANDERSON: Why am I going to kill you,Ed?
WITWER: There's no motive
ANDERSON: My wife calling you before breakfast?
WITWER: We were planning a surprise party. It was going to be today. Happy birthday, partner.
ANDERSON: This party's no fun, Ed. It's a hell of a surprise, though. I'm having trouble trusting people, Ed, I gotta tell you. The train makes two stops, here and here: 20th, then 33rd Street.
OFFICER: The train makes two stops, here and here: 20th, then 33rd Street.
WITWER: ( to the officer ) Split the units, go to both
OFFICER: We'll never make 20th
ANDERSON: You there, Ed?
WITWER: I'm here. You gotta come in, Paul .
ANDERSON: I'm a Cop, Ed. I need a motive.
WITWER: Come in. We'll figure this thing out together.
WITWER: It'll get ugly if you keep running. And your eyes, Paul every move you make a Scanner will pinpoint you for us.
ANDERSON: I saw a news flash. You're the new Director. Is that the point of this?
WITWER: Fuck you.
ANDERSON: Didn't think so. But it has to be something, Ed. Paul. Come in.
WITWER: Paul. Come in.
ANDERSON: If I come in, it puts me close to you. If I get close . I may kill you. I can't risk that. Anyway, they'd force you to lock me up. And that'd be it I'd never get my chance to solve this thing.
WITWER: You're kinds liking this, in a way, aren't you? The action .
ANDERSON: And you get to be a real cop again. We get to flex our muscles.
TECHNICIAN 2: We have visual verification he's still on the train.
ANDERSON'S VOICE: I want to tell you something, partner. You listening?
WITWER: ANDERSON'S VOICE ( beat )
ANDERSON'S VOICE: I gotta do this. I have to figure this thing out. But listen to me now. If it was you running, I'd come after you, Ed.
WITWER: You wouldn't shoot a cop would you, Paul? Paul?
TECHNICIAN 1: He's still on the line. Police. Everyone down on your hands and knees! Oh, shit.
DOC: Got a cold.
ANDERSON: I'm not here for cat surgery, Doc.
DOC: Yeah. All right.
ANDERSOIN: I'm a cop, I know
DOC: I gotta take your eyes out. And put in new ones.
ANDERSON: Yeah. I

ANDERSON: ( Fuzzily ) ) Nano-re .construction.
DOC: Organic microrobots that reconstruct nerves and blood vessels. It'll feel like fleas chewing on your eyeballs. Don't scratch.
ANDERSON: You tighten up again in about thirty minutes. Hurts like nothing you ever felt. It's vicious, but effective. I'll put it in your bag.
DOC: You tighten up again in about thirty minutes. Hurts like nothing you ever felt. It's vicious, but effective. I'll put it in your bag.
ANDERSON: I'm hungry, but sick to my stomach.
ANDERSON: ( to himself )
OFFICER 1: Got 27 warm bodies in this place. What should it take, three or four Do four. Speed things up, so we can go eat.
OFFICER 2: Do four. Speed things up, so we can go eat.
OLD WOMAN: It's nice to have a little company
OFFICER 1: Stinking drunk.
OFFICER 2: ( beat ) Or a guy who doesn't want to get
OFFICER 1: Let's eat.
WITWER: They told me to move into Paul's office. I said fuck you very much.
LISA: I know. I know that.
WITWER: Yeah. But if he shoots a cop . Which is what he does four days from now, isn't it?
LISA: He'd never hurt you.
WITWER: I know that. But the other thing I know is the Precogs are never
DRIVER: Welcome aboard, Mr. Symington. Plenty of seats in the back.
ANDERSON: Time to upgrade your alarm system,
SENATOR MALCOLM: There's no motive.
ANDERSON: There's, always a motive.
SENATOR MALCOLM: What the fuck was I worried about? You can't kill me. The Precogs would've seen it.
ANDERSON: Tell you something about the Precogs, Senator. They're great on murder. But it's the little things they fail to see.
WITWER: He hasn't shown up on one goddamn IdentiScan in three days. He's found a room he's going to sit it out.
LIEUTENANT GLASER: He's found a room he's going to sit it out.
WITWER: Yeah, except for holding a gun to senator Malcolm's goddman head in his own goddman house last night, Anderson's sitting it out! Why hasn't he been scanned?
LIEUTENANT GLASER: Hes beating the scanners
WITWER: No one beats the scanners.
LIEUTENANT GLASER: But the scarring always
WITWER: He went the bastard had his eyes removed. New ones sewn in.
LIEUTENANT GLASER: That takes weeks to heal.
WITWER: If you're prepared to go blind, a street surgeon'll juice up the repair cycle. They don't give a fuck about
TV: Anderson's face fills the monitor. The TV image is so big that Anderson overwhelms the room with his video presence. It's like God coming to pay a visit even if you want to avoid Him you can't. The big man with the popcorn tries to do just that. He surfs through a zillion channels, but Anderson's visage is EXT. THE SKY - THE SPRAWL DAY Anderson's face fills the skies, too. Witwer and Precrime have pulled out all the stops. Advertising dirigibles float by with Anderson's image on it. Holographic billboards with Anderson hover in the air. There are so many Andersons in the sky he seems to be part of the weather, a special type of cloud. People on the streets look up, briefly interested, then go about their business.
VIDEO KIOSK: The mug shot of Anderson disappears and is replaced by a Precrime SPOKESWOMAN.
SPOKESWOMAN: The United States Supreme Court has issued a special injunction allowing the unprecedented public viewing of former Precrime Director Paul Anderson's future murder of Edward Witwer, the current Director.
ANDERSON: His mouth slowly opens. He steps back against a wall and slides his hand into his pants pocket. He looks at the Precog DISC in his cupped hand, then quickly puts it away.
SPOKESWOMAN: She continues her declamation
ANDERSON: Shakes his head in confusion and disbelief. But he has the Precog disc .
OLD GUY: This oughtta be good, huh?
VIDEO: And there it is, Anderson and Witwer standing there pointing guns at each other. The whole thing just as we saw it before. All the way through to the fatal moment.
KIOSK: And there it is, Anderson and Witwer standing there pointing guns at each other. The whole thing just as we saw it before. All the way through to the fatal moment.
ANDERSON: Oh, Ed .
ANDERSON: "Ennis Page engages the services of prostitutes because his relationships with them compound his feelings of Direct quote from your psychological profile the kind of shit I had to know as your former boss.
PAGE: I fuck whores and I'm orderly, so Something's out of order, Ennis. Deeply out of order.
ANDERSON: Something's out of order, Ennis. Deeply out of order.
PAGE: ( utterly baffled ) You can't make copies
ANDERSON: Ennis you gave out the same disc twice. Less than an hour apart. The one I stole. And then another one. Of the same event.
PAGE: It's impossible. The Precogs can only move forward to new events. Into the future. They never repeat.
DIGITAL VOICE: Have a nice night, Mr. Symington
YOUNG GUY: Hey! Hey, you can't.
ANDERSON: It's me.
LISA: Lisa grips the phone and turns to the wall
ANDERSON: Your phone will be bugged. So we can't meet, we can't do anything. Just listen. Nowing you're listening is enough.
LISA: I know. Witwer sent them. He saw the disc and had to do his job. Tell me you forgive me. Please.
ANDERSON: I know. Witwer sent them. He saw the disc and had to do his job. Tell me you forgive me. Please.
LISA: Of course, I forgive you.
ANDERSON: All these people I need to forgive Do you think Frank forgave me? All I could do for him was send him I love you. Frank hated gardenias.
LISA: ( whispers to herself ) Frank hated gardenias.
VOICE: Paul Anderson. Drop to your hands and knees!
DRIVER: What the hell Paul Anderson. Drop to your hands and knees!
VOICE: Paul Anderson. Drop to your hands and knees!
ANDERSON: Pick one for me!
KID: THEY TRY TO WALK AWAY The girl lifts a nervous finger and points. The Uptown. He runs to board it, as they run in the opposite direction to the Downtown.
ANDERSON: Point to the train I should take. I don't know.
KID: I don't know.
THE STAIRS: Precrime officers crouch around the bend, silently snatching people out of the way as they come into view. They wait -but Anderson does not come. And he does not come. On signal, the Precrime officers rush down the stairs.
OFFICER: Don't kill me! Jesus. Please.
ANDERSON: But the Precogs would've predicted me killing you. You'd know whether I do or not.
OFFICER: They're off homicides. They're redirecting them to help us locate
TV: The murder of Witwer by Anderson is being shown over and over in a continuous loop. Flashing at the bottom is the hotline number: "1-800-PRECRIME." Then- "Call Now! Call BACK TO SCENE Now Lisa takes out the Precog disc Anderson gave to her -the first disc. She places it in the specialized monitor on the judge's bench. The tv and the judge's monitor sit side by side. The tv plays the version of the murder from the second disc; the judge's monitor plays the version from the first disc. She stares intently, her eyes flicking back and forth from one version to the other. They seem absolutely identical. When the judge's monitor goes blank, she starts it over again. Lisa stares, watching her husband murder his best friend, EXT. A GAS STATION - ALEXANDRIA DAY A gas station right out of the fifties. An attendant in a uniform and cap whistles while he wipes down the windshield of a sky blue Rambler. In the background, Anderson walks toward a men's room.
ANDERSON'S FACE: The skin on both cheeks begins to pucker. The muscle tone around his chin goes soft, and begins to sag like an old man's. That is the effect like he is aging fifty years. His forehead wrinkles, the skin under his eyes droop. Healthy pink is replaced by bloodless gray.
ATTENDANT: You all right in there?
TOUR GUIDE: Welcome to the main headquarters of Precrime. Smaller Precrime branches are scattered throughout the United
WITWER: What is it?
TECHNICIAN: Must be a glitch .
WITWER: Anderson just got IdentiScanned.
TECHNICIAN: Anderson just got IdentiScanned.
WITWER: Where is he?
TECHNICIAN: But he's had his eyes done. Right? Sir? Tries to think it through.
WITWER: ( barely audible ) He had to have.
TECHNICIAN: Jesus Christ, sir. He's in the basement of this building.
WITWER: This is
LIEUTENANT GLASER: Standing orders from the Security Panel, sir.
WITWER: If he wants to get to me, he'll get to me.
LIEUTENANT GLASER: No, he won't, sir.
TECHNICIAN: Don't worry, air -emergency generators will kick on in five seconds. Explanation, please!
WITWER: Explanation, please!
TECHNICIAN: Uh, sir. It seems . he got the generators, too.
VOICE: An explosion of light fills the room in STROBE-LIKE blasts. And leaping through the light is ANDERSON. The temporarily blinded guard and technicians have dropped to their knees. Anderson stun guns them quickly. The strobes fade, and Anderson sets a zirc-flare on the floor. We see that the enzyme is wearing off his facial features are returning to normal. He is oblivious to the Precogs in their chairs. It is the equipment he is after. Through the observation window we see ENNIS PAGE watching in horror as Anderson severs the light cables connecting the Precog helmets to the mainframe. Anderson aims a sonic blast at the observation window, blowing it out and knocking Page unconscious. Then he reaches into the room and destroys the mainframe itself with a series of Anderson is so intent on destruction he does not sense a PRESENCE behind him. Perhaps it is because the movement is so completely devoid of malice it is beyond detection. A HAND, the fingers pale and slender, reaches out and takes hold of his hand. Anderson whirls around, weapon out. And there before him, is the FEMALE Precog. He looks at her, then beyond her to the other Precogs who are lolling in semiconsciousness in their chairs. Her helmet is off. She is young, but her close-cropped hair is silver white. And when she speaks, her voice is like the wind whispering through time.
FEMALE: Save us, Anderson.
ANDERSON: I have to get out of here.
FEMALE: Save us.
ANDERSON: You stopped giving them information, so they couldn't track me.
FEMALE: And what can Anderson do but catch her before she falls? What can he do but throw her over his shoulder, and in the fading light of the flare, make a run for freedom.
LISA: ( wearily, to herself ) Help me, Paul.
WITWER: Why didn't the Precogs know he was coming to do this?
LIEUTENANT GLASER: We won't let that happen, sir.
WITWER: You won't, huh?
TECHNICIAN: They're a hive mind, sir. It takes three for their predictive abilities to be fully operational.
WITWER: These two are all I have to find the man who is about to murder me. Hook them up, and flood them with whatever kind of fucking chemicals you have to. They are a machine, and I need that machine at my disposal.
LISA: Your IdentiScan is off, Ennis. I could just walk in here.
PAGE: I forgot. To turn it on.
LISA: You don't look surprised to see me.
PAGE: He took one of my babies.
LISA: He's desperate, Ennis. He had to. We have to help him.
PAGE: I delivered . a fake .. to him?
LISA: But he thought it was real, and ran with it. An hour later, you delivered a second disc of the same event. Witwer reviewed it. It was real. ( Beat ) How do I know this?
PAGE: He spilled coffee everywhere . Everywhere .
LISA: What coffee? What are you ?
FEMALE: My brothers aren't here.
ANDERSON: You didn't even look around. You We can sense each other. You must
FEMALE: ( beat ) We can sense each other. You must
ANDERSON: Stop. I saved I could do.
FEMALE: Thank you, Anderson.
ANDERSON: What am I going to do with you?
FEMALE: Name me, Anderson.
ANDERSON: Give me a name. I've never had one.
FEMALE: Give me a name. I've never had one.
ANDERSON: She turns to the wall.
FEMALE: Rose. They shifted your precognition so you would locate me.
ANDERSON: Rose. They shifted your precognition so you would locate me.
ROSE: ( beat ) Yes. And it hurt us, physically. Did you know that? The helmets, the controls. It hurts.
ANDERSON: ( guiltily ) I didn't know.
ROSE: We saw our chance. You would need to shut us down, you would have to come. We wanted you to come.
ANDERSON: You used me to save you.
ROSE: Anderson can't meet her eyes.
ANDERSON: Rose. What's going to happen to us? Can you see that?
ROSE: I'm weak. And away from my brothers. I see glimpses and hints of things nearby. But it's all . scattered. I'm tired of the future, Anderson.
ANDERSON: You didn't know I was going to do that, did you?
ROSE: No. Oh, Anderson. It was lovely.
LIEUTENANT GLASER: Who else could it've been?
WITWER: ( beat ) Page worshipped the system. He fell apart. Shot himself.
LIEUTENANT GLASER: Witwer doesn't say anything. He just stares at the body The crab finishes. The holographic doctor unfolds his arms and turns his head to Witwer. He is only a computer interface, but even so, it seems as if there is surprise in his digitalized voice.
HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR: Director Witwer. This event is a positive homicide.
LISA: She reaches down and freezes on a close-up of Anderson on the two monitors.
LISA: The one on the left, the first disc -it's a fake. He doesn't have blue eyes anymore.
WITWER: A fake.
LISA: Precogs, induce them to make fakes
WITWER: Bypass the Precogs and slip a fake disc in with that day's real ones.
LISA: ( excited ) We're all programmed to believe anything we see on a Precog disc. The system has never been wrong .
WITWER: ( long beat ) It's gone too far, Lisa She shakes her head, shocked at his response
LISA: He was set up! You Paul kills you, you're both out of the picture.
WITWER: Jesus, Ed. Stop this thing! And then we can investigate Witwer's mouth opens and closes. He tries Ennis Page was murdered last night.
LISA: Jesus, Ed. Stop this thing! And then we can investigate Witwer's mouth opens and closes. He tries Ennis Page was murdered last night.
WITWER: Ennis Page was murdered last night.
LISA: I think he is. A murderer . and a future murderer. Lisa. What does it matter that the first disc is a fake . if the second one's real?
WITWER: I think he is. A murderer . and a future murderer. Lisa. What does it matter that the first disc is a fake . if the second one's real?
ANDERSON: Rose. Listen to me. I'm going to leave you here. I have to keep No. You must save my brothers.
ROSE: No. You must save my brothers.
ANDERSON: It's impossible. There's no time. I've done what I can do!
ROSE: Come here, Anderson.
ROSE: It was impossible to save that boy but you did, Anderson. It's in you. It's what you are. I'd get there.
ANDERSON: I'd get there.
ROSE: You are a man who saves others. Save my brothers.
ANDERSON: I'm in a lot of trouble right now.
ROSE: My brothers are in more trouble. They've moved them to . an awful Rose. Ed Witwer -he's in the most trouble of all. Who saves him?
ANDERSON: Rose. Ed Witwer -he's in the most trouble of all. Who saves him?
DR. RESFIELD: We're not really set up for this type of
ANDERSON: Rose. Try to drink.
ROSE: Your wife. We have to get her here,
ANDERSON: I don't know .
ROSE: I don't know .
ANDERSON: What are you seeing?
ROSE: have to get her here.
ANDERSON: You're scaring me, Rose
ROSE: Stop talking. It uses me up.
SECRETARY: Sir? I'm sorry, she stepped out for a few minutes.
LISA: Hello? Hello?
ANDERSON'S VOICE: I need you.
LISA: Two hundred dollars if you don't scan me.
MAN: You bite me, bitch, I'll pull your teeth out.
LISA: Cut it a little close there, Rose got the street wrong. She's getting weak.
ANDERSON: Rose got the street wrong. She's getting weak.
LISA: INT. THE BOARDING HOUSE LATER Rose sits up in bed silently watching Lisa and Anderson Lisa needs to touch him. She keeps a hand on his arm, brushes back a loose look of his hair. Rose is mesmerized by her actions. She drinks in everything, every bit of life. Anderson and Lisa are deep in conversation. They speak to each other as if Rose were hardly present in the room. Anderson is trying to process everything Lisa has told him.
ANDERSON: Two discs. One fake. One real.
LISA: I don't think there were supposed to be two. Whoever planned it, wasn't counting on two. An infallible system. Every disc ever generated has been true .
ANDERSON: An infallible system. Every disc ever generated has been true .
LISA: Somebody wants you out of the way so they make a fake disc. Who ever doubts the discs?
ANDERSON: believed it, absolutely. I was certain I was going to murder Witwer.
LISA: And generated the second disc. The real one.
ANDERSON: A self-fulfilling prophesy. I believed it was true. And that made it true.
ROSE: ( beat ) We see what we see. I'm sorry, Anderson. It's been predicted.
LIEUTENANT GLASER: We can't take chances, sir
WITWER: The event.
LIEUTENANT GLASER: I've been ordered to get you onto the craft. By force if necessary.
WITWER: The event is inevitable, Lieutenant.
LIEUTENANT GLASER: I don't leave this room without you, sir. The Security Panel insists.
ANDERSON: Nobody could slip a fake disc past Ennis Page Lisa shakes her head.
LISA: He was the weak link in the perfect Obsessive compulsive niners can't allow changes in the routine
ANDERSON: Obsessive compulsive niners can't allow changes in the routine
LISA: Something threw him off. He tried to tell me. It didn't make any sense. Something about "spilled Someone was in his office with him. And coffee spilled .
ANDERSON: Rose. What is it?
ROSE: ( beat ) We weren't just lost in the future. We were in the Chamber, too. Our eyes were open. In the present.
ANDERSON: Your eyes were open. What did you see, Rose?
ROSE: Who would I have told? Who ever talked to us? Who cared that we could talk?
ANDERSON: Rose. Who spilled the coffee? Straight ahead .
MEMORY HIT: Rose sits in her chair in the Precog Chamber. Her brothers sit in their usual places on either side of her. The technicians tend to them. Rose's eyes are open. She sees everything in the room. The technicians, the machines . and across the room a large window where she can see Ennis Page working the mainframe Rose watches through the window . As the computer emits discs, Page gathers them
ANDERSON: Ed .
LISA: The perfect system -brought down by a cup of coffee. My god.
ANDERSON: ( long beat ) He set into motion his own death. He didn't know it would go this far. ( to Rose ) What makes me leave this room? If I stay here I won't kill him. Right?
WITWER: You see, if you think you can put me on a hovercraft and save me, then you don't believe in the infallibility of the Precog system.
WITWER: Things quiet?
OFFICER: Sir. Should you . be here?
WITWER: There's been a development. A body's been found in the Sprawl.
OFFICER: They're checking it out. I need to see what the Precogs have seen.
WITWER: They're checking it out. I need to see what the Precogs have seen.
WITWER: Borrowed this from the technicians' lounge. You don't think they'll mind, do you?
DR.RESFIELD: You shouldn't be here, Director.
WITWER: No, no. This is should be.
DR. RESFIELD: You're under a lot of strain,
WITWER: And tv's so good for that soothes the mind.
DR. RESFIELD: We're getting nothing from them.
WITWER: And that's because . ?
DR. RESFIELD: I don't know.
WITWER: Do you think they know where Anderson It's impossible to tell. We've done everything. Maybe even too much.
DR. RESFIELD: It's impossible to tell. We've done everything. Maybe even too much.
WITWER: They know how to find Anderson for They're the perfect machine, Doctor. You just have to know which button to push.
ANDERSON: Jesus Christ.
LISA: Come on, Rose.
ANDERSON: One hour. We hold it together for an hour, Witwer lives and I'm not a murderer.
LISA: She won't last an hour.
ANDERSON: She begins to wail as she thrashes in his arms.
ROSE: He's killed him, Anderson!
ANDERSON: Did he kill both of them, Rose?
ROSE: Does it matter, Anderson?
LISA: If you leave this room.
ANDERSON: Then I'm a cop, just trying to do
WITWER: Is he coming? No? Yes? Maybe? I think yes.
WITWER: I figured, since I can see the future, too, maybe I could get a little disc action going. Just kidding.
ANDERSON: There's never anything good on, you
WITWER: You're not the old Ed. You've lost
ANDERSON: You're not the old Ed. You've lost
WITWER: knees, partner.
ANDERSON: I'm not your partner.
WITWER: The air went out of you when Frank D'Ignazio killed himself.
ANDERSON: He was guilty. I accepted that.
WITWER: creeping in on you. The lab trying to engineer more Precogs . Malcolm pressuring you to expand .
ANDERSON: Never been my style.
WITWER: Precrime needs to grow. You would have stood in its way. The Security Panel wouldn't have understood that. What you're capable of. What a bulldog you are. Look what you've been doing to us all week. Amazing. You're the best.
ANDERSON: So you took matters into your own hands.
WITWER: I understood the threat. I understood
YOU: Anderson looks at the dead Precog
ANDERSON: You killed a Precog. You ended the system you wanted to protect.
WITWER: Wrong. This lab will make more. Believe it, Paul.
ANDERSON: Knowing the exact moment of your death -it's made you crazy, Ed.
WITWER: You sonofabitch!
ANDERSON: That's right. No gun.
WITWER: You see?! That's exactly what I'm talking about. You don't Believe!
ANDERSON: You can't have it both ways. You don't want to die. That's why you lured me here to kill me first.
WITWER: Pick it up
ANDERSON: Let's not do this, Ed Witwer trains his gun on Anderson. Anderson trains his gun on Witwer.
WITWER: Now do you believe?
DARKNESS: And then, slowly emerging from the mists of darkness, a pale, beautifully proportioned FACE. It is Rose's face. The camera pulls back and we see that she is lying on a grassy hillside. Her brother is lying beside her. They are looking up at the night sky, at a sky filled with Rose stares up into the sky, and speaks in a soft voice to her brother.
ROSE: James. Can you guess what I'm
JAMES: ( beat )
