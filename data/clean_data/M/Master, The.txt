JOHN MORE: Some of this seems quite like hypnosis, is it not?
MASTER: Oh no, this is funny. It's quite the reverse. Man is hypnotized. What we do is un-hypnotize him of the shackles. Allow him to raise his awareness and IQ.
JOHN MORE: What is the difference between this and Yes. Well. They are very different. No. Psychoanalysis, they lay back. No, no, no. Don't associate us with such people! That's terrible ( he, he ) why that's a bad manner don't you know? I mean at that business about sex and all that. That's for the neurotic or the person who is insane or something like that. That's nothing to do with us. They've failed. That's for the fortunate few who can afford the fees.
MASTER: Yes. Well. They are very different. No. Psychoanalysis, they lay back. No, no, no. Don't associate us with such people! That's terrible ( he, he ) why that's a bad manner don't you know? I mean at that business about sex and all that. That's for the neurotic or the person who is insane or something like that. That's nothing to do with us. They've failed. That's for the fortunate few who can afford the fees.
JOHN MORE: But some of this does in fact seem to share quite a lot with Dr. Freud and modern psychotherapy, does it not?
MASTER: No it does not. This is an exact science, you see. Comparable to physics or chemistry - but simpler. It's engineering. Herr Freud had his chance and contributed some very workable data, but in the end, he failed. So that's And how long does this take?
JOHN MORE: And how long does this take?
MASTER: That depends. But it can be quite fast. Quite fast. Or it can take some time. Sometimes less than 36 hours.
JOHN MORE: 36 hours? And you're saying that these methods can cure leukemia according to your book and what you've just said?
MASTER: Some forms of leukemia, 22 cases tested. 22 cases cured. Those are the results.
JOHN MORE: You can understand scepticism, can you Oh, yes, of course, yes. And this is to be expected and welcome. For without it we'd be positive's with no negatives - therefore zero. charge. We must have it.
MASTER: Oh, yes, of course, yes. And this is to be expected and welcome. For without it we'd be positive's with no negatives - therefore zero. charge. We must have it.
JOHN MORE: Are you a religious people?
MASTER: We are not incorporated as a religion, no. But remember this: that religion has come uniformly from a philosophy. Philosophy is senior to religion. You could call us a religion of religions.
JOHN MORE: Are you saying then that any religion is rather narrow in its outlook?
MASTER: No, no, no. I have no quarrel with man's belief's, but religions in general can be pre-occupied with a God or Idol or something of some such nature who is merely trying to fill the universe with a lot of little replicas of himself - we are trying to free the individual - not bend to a will of a God, you see. And if our teachings can reconcile these views it would be doing a great service to
JOHN MORE: Do you think it can?
MASTER: I not only think it can, I know it does.
JOHN MORE: You mentioned 'good science' and what it does.. .but doesn't that, by definition, allow for more than one opinion?
MASTER: Indeed, indeed. Which is why our gathering of day-ta is so far reaching -
JOHN MORE: Otherwise you merely have the will of one man - which is the basis of cult, is it T'is, t'is, indeed. Thankfully we are, all of us, working at break-neck speeds and in unison towards catching the minds fatal flaws and correcting it back to it's original state of perfect - whilst righting civilization.

FREDDIE: You're coming with me. Get up. I need some help and you wanna make a good show, no? Who's paying your way? CLARK looks to Elizabeth, who gives a look that says, "He's right."
BILL WHITE: I don't think this is right to do -

CLARK: I read the first book. I worked at Boeing for three years. When I read the book, I didn't want to waste my time there anymore. I came to help the Cause.
FREDDIE: What did it say?
CLARK: I'm skeptical of everything. Always have been. All I know is I used to not be able to sleep. Now I sleep through the night. I spent 18 months at the Presidio with every Army head-shrinker they had and not one did as much for me as Book One did. That's simple arithmetic to me. And I met Elizabeth, so.
FREDDIE: That's good.
CLARK: He changes things. And the research is hard to keep up with. None of this is done by a long shot. Sometimes it's easy to get lost.
FREDDIE: He's a very smart man. I can tell that. I don't understand myself but - more time with it and I might - I feel better - I feel like I've more to do with my life since I met him. and I JUST met him. So - that can't be a bad thing, right?
