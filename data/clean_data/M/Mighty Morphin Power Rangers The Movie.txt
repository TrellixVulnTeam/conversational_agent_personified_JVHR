BLACK SCREEN: Words SCRAWL UP ON SCREEN and we hear a RESOUNDING VOICE.
VOICE: In a time of great strife, a legendary interdimensional being known as Zordon, came to the city of Angel Grove to establish a vanguard in the never ending struggle against evil. with the aid of his trusted assistant, Alpha 5, the noble master sought out six extraordinary teenagers and gave them the power to transform into an unstoppable fighting force. In time of great need, the young heroes could now call upon colossal assault vehicles known as "Zords". while the identity of the six remained a guarded secret, their courageous exploits soon became the stuff of Legend, earning them the title. The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.

ALPHA 5: In a place that came to be known as Angel Grove.
ZORDON: The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED! You must return it to the depths. or anyone should open it and Ivan is released!

KIMBERLY: We have to help him!
ZORDON: . Rangers. thank goodness you're safe.
TOMMY: We have to get you back inside your time warp.
ZORDON: I'm afraid that's impossible. The power has been destroyed. It's gone. The Zords, the weapons. all of it. The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers are no more.
KIMBERLY: Zordon. you can't leave us. Ever since you came into our lives. you've been like another father `to us all.-
ZORDON: . You must be strong. Ivan almost overthrew the planet once. and now I'm afraid he has the strength to see his scheme through.
BILLY: what're we going to do?
ALPHA 5: I do not LIKE Green Eggs and Ham! I do not like them, Sam-I-am!

ADAM: ALPHA 5
ALPHA 5: . They say that somewhere beyond the Hyperion Constellation there exists a mythological power that is beyond all comprehension.
TOMMY: How can we get to it?
ALPHA 5: As the legend goes, the power is impossible to obtain.
ROCKY: We have to try, Alpha. It's our only hope.
ALPHA 5: It's far too dangerous. Zordon would never allow it.
AISHA: If we don't try, Zordon won't If Ivan Ooze isn't stopped, nobody will survive.
ADAM: If Ivan Ooze isn't stopped, nobody will survive.
ALPHA 5: Ay, yi, yi, yi. The legend speaks of a Master Warrior who lives on the planet Phaedos. This is the only person who knows the secrets of the power.
AISHA: How can we reach Phaedos?
ALPHA 5: Zordon's going to have my orbicular spheroids when he hears out about this!
ALPHA 5: This is an emergency reserve of morphonic emissions. It should be enough to get -you there.
ALPHA 5: There is one problem. I only have enough reserve to send you Phaedos. I can't bring you So how do we get back?
ADAM: So how do we get back?
ALPHA 5: . You'll have to pray that the legends are true.
ALPHA 5: You're sure you want to do this?! The Rangers share purposeful looks.

MORDANT: Zedd's gonna kick this snotball into next week!
IVAN: Ooooh, that tickles!
IVAN: My turn.
RITA: This is all your fault! If you'd taken me out tonight like you were suposed to, none of this would've happened.
IVAN: Now you have a choice, either serve me, or join those insufferable cheesedongs.
GOLDAR: We never liked the cheesedongs in the first place.
MORDANT: Couldn''t stand them low-class all the way. And did you catch a whiff of their BREATH?! It's like having a conversation with a couple of ONIONS! Not to He's just visiting for the Now what about,the Rangers, oh hideous one?

AISHA: Welcome to beautiful downtown . Incredible.
ROCKY: . Incredible.
TOMMY: Let's see if we can find this Master warrior.
IVAN: Taking over the world is one thing. It's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer.
GOLDAR: You want me to place a few calls?
IVAN: No need. I'm going to use the young minds of Angel Grove.
GOLDAR: No offense, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting.
IVAN: Yes, well, I suppose you'd know a little something about that. Not to worry. I'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils! And what better way to entice them . than with a little Ivan's Ooze?!
GOLDAR: But boss, what about their Ah, the old and doddering. I'm going to SCOURGE their puny minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S. And then I'll put them to work rebuilding my empire.

TOMMY: Kimberly glances up.
TOMMY: You okay?
KIMBERLY: I was just thinking about Zordon. everything we've been through together.
AISHA: You know, meeting Zordon. teaming up with you guys, it's the best thing that's ever happened to me.
ROCKY: It's the best thing that's ever happened to all of us.
ADAM: . He's gonna make it, guys.

DULCEA: What do you know of the Great Only that we need it to defeat Ivan Ooze.
KIMBERLY: Only that we need it to defeat Ivan Ooze.
DULCEA: It is said that to those who possess the Power. all things are possible.
BILLY: Where did it originate?
DULCEA: In another time, another dimension. It was brought here long ago by the "Nathadians", a people who are now all but They built an impenetrable stone Monolith to store the power and keep it from their enemies. For thousands of years, beings from all over the Universe have tried to obtain it. ALL have
AISHA: So how can we get to it?
DULCEA: The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being.
TOMMY: And how do we do that?
DULCEA: By learning the ancient art of Ninjetti. It is the Genesis of what you on earth have come to know as the Ninja. It is the perfect union of mind, body and spirit.
ROCKY: Look, Zordon doesn't have much longer to live. And for all we know, Angel Grove could already be under attack. We don't have TIME for this.
DULCEA: You don't understand. If you do not have the Ninjetti, the power will destroy you. To reach the Monolith we must traverse the Neola jungle. We will train today, and set out on foot tomorrow.
