BRAD: What?! Oh that's how it is? A'ight then. I'm Audi! I need to take a drive.
BESS: What can we do, doctor?

BILL: Do you think we can bring him I don't know. This is the most advanced case of gangsta-phrenia I've ever seen.
DR. FELDMAN: ( grim ) I don't know. This is the most advanced case of gangsta-phrenia I've ever seen.
BESS: Oh no, not gangsta-phrenia!
BESS: Bradley, I know you're busy, but we need to talk.

BRAD: Ever feel like you don't belong?
GLADYS: Ever feel like you don't belong?
BRAD: Ever feel like you don't belong?

TOM: The team gathers around it's a gang pitch.
BRETT: Brad might act 'ghetto,' but let's face it, he's never been east of Beverly Hills.
JEN: But what if we give him a little dose of reality?
GARY: Let him get a firsthand look at the ghetto.
BILL: You mean, have Brad actually. go Sounds dangerous.
TOM: Sounds dangerous.
BILL: Sounds dangerous.
BRETT: It'll be perfectly safe.
BILL: How does it work?
JEN: We hire actors to play gangsters.
TOM: They car-jack Brad, then take him on a 'tour' of the 'hood. give him a little taste of what thug life's really like. It might just scare the black out of him.
TOM: Look, I'm as down as the next brother, guy. fellah. I grew up in Compton, okay? But let's get over the P.C. thing and face facts. Unless we do something soon, Brad's gonna cost us this
BILL: I don't know. it sounds so drastic.
TOM: Maybe drastic is what Brad needs, Bill. He is twenty-four. I mean, what's he gonna do for a living,
BILL: Who do we get for the gangsters?
TOM: Remember the anti-crime spot we shot last month?
GARY: We've got it cued up.

SEAN: Why don't you have him steal some watermelon while you're at it?
TOM: Pays fifteen grand apiece.
TOM: Wait we're kidnapping him, couldn't we get arrested?
SEAN: Wait we're kidnapping him, couldn't we get arrested?
TOM: Got you covered. Mr. Gluckman's a billionaire if you run into any problems with the law, we're very close with the commissioner. On the flip side, if you screw up and a single hair is touched on Bradley's over-privileged head, I will make sure that you do serious time. Clear?
SEAN: Cris. tal.
TOM: What about the money?
PJ: What about the money?
