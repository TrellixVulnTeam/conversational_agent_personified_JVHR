FULL YELLOW DRAFT: July 25, 2002
FLASH (V.O.): 'It's like a jungle sometimes, It makes me wonder how I keep from going under...'
FLASH (V.O.): 'Broken glass everywhere, people pissing on the stairs you know they just don't care...'
FLASH (V.O.): 'Can't take the smell, Can't take the noise, Got no money to move out I guess I got no choice...'
FLASH (V.O.): 'Rats in the front room, Roaches in the back...'
FLASH (V.O.): 'A crazy lady, livin' in a bag, Eatin' outta garbage pails, Used to be a fag hag...'
FLASH (V.O.): 'Don't push me cuz I'm close to the edge, I'm tryin', not to lose my head...'
FLASH (V.O.): 'It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder, How I keep from goin' under...'
BILL: Speaking of family, I'd like to introduce my wife Bess...
BILL: ... and my daughter, little Brenda.
BILL: Any questions?
BILL: Deb?
REPORTER #1: Where's your son?
TOM: Thank you for all your questions, but we've run out of...
MOCHA: Yo yo yoooo!   Listen up, y'all!
MONSTER: Y'all better chill...
HADJI: ... 'cuz B-Rad G about to get ill!!!
BRAD: Yo! What's up all you media people?! This is B-Rad G, kickin' it real from the 'bu, represizzin'!!!
BRAD: 'Y'all gathered here on this special occasion. Listen to my pops, he's your West Coast liaison' So show up, don't make me throw up.
TOM: That's it for today, guys, very busy schedule, thank you!!
TOM: What's the damage?
JEN: We're down nine points in the polls.
BILL: In fifteen minutes?
GARY: And dropping.
BILL: It's a disaster.
BRETT: I called the Times and the Chronicle, they're gonna play the whole thing off as a joke.
BILL: Thank God.
TOM: How the hell did this happen?
BILL: I have no idea. I thought he was out of town.
TOM: Jen, I gave you specific orders to get some handlers and keep Brad locked down until after the announcement.
JEN: I did! They flew to the ranch in Maui last night!
TOM: Maui?! Wasn't he at the villa in South Hampton?
BILL: I thought he was at the chalet in Aspen.
GARY: (checking laptop) Nope... It was the compound in Bermuda.
TOM: Oh for God's sake!   Can't we --
BRAD: Yo, Pops, that was off the hizzook! I just got you another million votes right dare!
BILL: What are you doing here, son?
BRAD: I knew I had to show up in order for you to blow up. So I had Captain Tony fire up the Lear jizzy and booya! I'm in da hizzy, gonna be on the campaign trizzy, 24/seven, you know, kissin' babies and whatnot. Pound it!
TOM: Bill, you've got to shut this down, now. Tell Brad he can't work with you, period.
BILL: No, no. I love his enthusiasm... It's just a little misguided. There must be something he can do for the campaign, where he can't hurt us.
TOM: Such as...?
BILL: I don't know... phones, stuffing envelopes, making signs, something.
BILL: ... in Bill Gluckman's administration, women will have better health care, women will have better day care, and women will have better jobs! From here on in, my campaign has a new slogan!
BILL: (stunned, hollow) Bill Gluckman's down with the bitches and ho's'?
TOM: It was supposed to read, 'Women are first with Gluckman.'
BRAD: That's old school. Pops, you got to keep your pimp hand strong.
BRAD: Peep y'all later. I'ma go work on my new campaign rhyme, 'Election Erection.' It's gonna be large! Yo! I'ma start on a new sign.
TOM: That's it, Bill. If Brad doesn't straighten up, your political career is finished.
BILL: No, Tom. I promise you, I will not lose this election over my son.
TOM: What are you going to do?
BILL: Set up an appointment with my shrink.
DR. FELDMAN: So... Bradley...
BRAD: Why you keep callin' me dat?
DR. FELDMAN: Well that's your name, isn't it?
BRAD: It's my slave name, a'ight?    I told you like fi'ty times.
DR. FELDMAN: (sighs) Yes, okay... B-Rad...
BRAD: Wassup?
DR. FELDMAN: Let's play an association game.
DR. FELDMAN: Now, which one doesn't belong?
BRAD: Shoot. N.W.A., fool.   They broke up a long time ago.
BILL: (losing temper) Dammit, Brad, stop acting like a gang member. You're from Malibu, you live in a nice home...
BESS: With nice maids!
DR. FELDMAN: Bill, Bess, go to your happy places.
DR. FELDMAN: What are your goals, B-Rad?    What do you want out of life?
BRAD: To be the biggest rapper dere ever was! See, I got something to say, and I need the world to hear it. I'm the shiznit. I'll buy y'all cars!
DR. FELDMAN: I see. And when did you first start feeling like you were this... shiznit?
BRAD: Oh, damn... way back in the day. I've had these beats in my head since I was a little shortie...
GLADYS: Gluckman residence.
GLADYS: No, Bill and Bess are out of the country until December.
BRAD (V.O.): From then on it was hip-hop 24/seven.
BESS (V.O.): Finish those vegetables, Bradley.
BILL (V.O.): You can't be excused until you do.
SEVEN-YEAR-OLD-BRAD: Tch.   Forget y'all.
BILL (V.O.): That's it, mister.
BESS (V.O.): When we get home... sometime in the near future... you're going to be in big trouble!!
BRAD: Nope.
BESS: (defensive) That's ridiculous!
BILL: What about your bar mitzvah?
BILL: Mazel tov, Bradley!
UNCLE LOUIE (O.S.): What's the theme of your party, kid? Star Wars? Baseball? Superheroes?
BRAD: It's O.P.P., bitch!
DR. FELDMAN: Bess, I'm sensing you'd like to share.
BESS: B-Rad, you're a wonderful son... it's just that, well --
BILL: Oh stop beating around the bush, Bess. What we're trying to say is, Brad, that your behavior is, well, it's an embarrassment to the family.
BRAD: Yo, Pops, that hurts my feelings.
BILL: I'm sorry, but it's the truth.
BRAD: Don't be hatin'.
BILL: And, Brad... I can't have you on the campaign any longer.
BRAD: What?! Oh that's how it is? A'ight then. I'm Audi! I need to take a drive.
BESS: What can we do, doctor?
DR. FELDMAN: Well, his lack of parental guidance left Brad wide open to outside influence, allowing hip- hop culture to firmly imprint on his psyche.
BILL: Do you think we can bring him back?
DR. FELDMAN: (grim) I don't know. This is the most advanced case of gangsta-phrenia I've ever seen.
BESS: Oh no, not gangsta-phrenia!
BESS: Bradley, I know you're busy, but we need to talk.
BRAD: What's up?
BESS: After our therapy session I realized that your father and I could have been better parents. We neglected you and I feel terrible.
BESS: Yes.  So from here on out I'm going to be a better mother. I want to get closer to you... be there for you. If ever you need --
BESS: Hello? Celeste! When did you get back?! What?! Oh my God! I've been waiting for that bag for six months! (to Brad, covering phone) It's my personal shopper. (back to phone) Stay right there. I'm on my way!
BESS: So... where we... Oh yes. I'm always here for you, Bradley. Do you have my cell number?
BRAD: Gladys?
GLADYS: Yeah?
BRAD: Ever feel like you don't belong?
GLADYS: Nothin' to do but keep it real. Be proud of who you are.
BRAD: Yeah, you right... Gladys, when they gonna leave our people alone?
GLADYS: (emotional) I don't know, baby, I just don't know... (notices Brad's plate) Eat your greens before they get cold, boy.
BRAD: (reading pager) Oh no, not again!
TOM: How'd it go with Feldman?
BILL: Great news. If he sees Brad five days a week, he says we'll see improvement in three to four years.
JEN: But... the election's in two months.
BILL: Right, good point.
BILL: I'm all ears.
TOM: Guys?
BRETT: Brad might act 'ghetto,' but let's face it, he's never been east of Beverly Hills.
JEN: But what if we give him a little dose of reality?
GARY: Let him get a firsthand look at the ghetto.
BILL: You mean, have Brad actually... go there?
TOM: Exactly.
BILL: Sounds dangerous...
BRETT: It'll be perfectly safe.
BILL: How does it work?
JEN: We hire actors to play gangsters.
TOM: They car-jack Brad,     then take him on a 'tour' of the     'hood... give him a little taste     of what thug life's really like.      It might just scare the black out     of him.
AFRICAN-AMERICAN AIDE: Excuse me?
TOM: Look, I'm as down as the next brother, guy... fellah. I grew up in Compton, okay? But let's get over the P.C. thing and face facts. Unless we do something soon, Brad's gonna cost us this election.
BILL: I don't know... it sounds so drastic.
TOM: Maybe drastic is what Brad needs, Bill. He is twenty-four. I mean, what's he gonna do for a living, rap?
BILL: Who do we get for the gangsters?
TOM: Remember the anti-crime spot we shot last month?
GARY: We've got it cued up.
NARRATOR (V.O.): For too long, street violence has torn Californians apart...
BILL (V.O.): Fellas, instead of thinking of yourselves as what set you're from, or what crew you're rolling with, why can't you both be brothers. What do you say?
SEAN (V.O.): I guess we never thought of each other like that.
PJ (V.O.): Me neither, dawg.
BILL (V.O.): You see... (turning to camera) 'California is my family'...
BILL (V.O.): If we work together as a family there's no telling how high we can go.
TOM: Those are our guys, right there.
BILL: Will he be safe?
BILL: (fed up and confused) I don't know... can't we just...
BILL: Alright, fine, just do it.
BRAD: Lemme go.
MOCHA: You don't want to see him like dis.
BRAD: What happened?
MOCHA: He O.D.'d again.
BRAD: Why didn't you stop him?
MONSTER: I tried, yo!
BRAD: How many did he do?
MOCHA: Like twelve, thirteen, I don't know!
BRAD: Damn. Twelve Frapachizzo's. Brotha's caffeined out. Move aside.
HADJI: I'ma get mine! Step, fool!   I'll cut you, I swear!
BRAD: Just chill, Hadji, we're here to help. What's up?
HADJI: (frenzied) I... I... I was pickin' up aromatherapy candles at Illuminations for Moms, right? And the counter trick gave me lemon when I specifically axed for lilac!
BRAD: It's on now!
HADJI: Dat's right!
BRAD: Dis is our mall. Always was and always will be!
MOCHA: Woof woof!
OLD WOMAN: Oh, Mr. Amiraslani. I'm so glad you came back. Our clerk accidentally gave you the wrong aromatherapy candles. Here you go.
BRAD: You better be validatin' my parking?
OLD WOMAN: Of course, sir.
BRAD: Dat's what I'm talkin' 'bout.    We get ours!
SEAN: (incredulous) Hold the phone, buddy... you want us to scare this kid until he starts acting like a nice little white boy again?
TOM: Don't think you can handle it?
TOM: Fantastic.
TOM: Here's some background information on Brad.
PJ (O.S.): Malibootay?
SEAN: Frickin' A.
TOM: Okay, so here's the story -- it's your basic kidnapping...
SEAN: So we hold him for ransom?
TOM: Right.   But when you see   him acting ghetto and all, it    pisses you off  so much, you tour   him around the 'hood to show    him what things are really like. (hands PJ a list) I had my guys brainstorm    a few ideas...
SEAN: Why don't you have him steal some watermelon while you're at it?
TOM: Pays fifteen grand apiece.
SEAN AND PJ: (quickly) We're in.
TOM: Good.
SEAN: Wait -- we're kidnapping him, couldn't we get arrested?
TOM: Got you covered. Mr. Gluckman's a billionaire -- if you run into any problems with the law, we're very close with the commissioner. On the flip side, if you screw up and a single hair is touched on Bradley's over-privileged head, I will make sure that you do serious time. Clear?
SEAN: Cris... tal.
TOM: Good.
PJ: What about the money?
TOM: Five up front, twenty-five when you return him to us, white.
SEAN: ... As the driven snow.
PJ: Congrats, my brother.   We just booked another gig.
SEAN: Yeah, but it's totally dangerous, dude. You know what it's like in the 'hood. We could get shot!
PJ: We can handle ourselves. Come on, man, it's the ultimate acting challenge.
SEAN: You know what really chaps  my ass? After years of training and  study, the only parts they'll give  us are gangbangers. Just once I'd   like to play a character who has  decent grammar and doesn't wear Timberlands.
PJ: Beats gettin' dunked on by Bill Gluckman.
SEAN: Do we even know anybody down there?
PJ: My cousin.
SEAN: Shondra.
SHONDRA: You zooted, nigga?
SHONDRA: That's the stupidest thing I ever heard. I got better things to do with my time, boy.
SEAN: Like work at Wienie In A Bun?
PJ: Really. You're the one always talkin' about improvin' yourself.
SHONDRA: I am improvin' myself, fool. I broke up with no-good gang-bangin' Tec, I'm going to beauty school, then I'ma hook up my own salon...
PJ: In the meantime, how about hooking a brother up with a Pepsi and some fries?
SHONDRA: Shut up, stupid.
SEAN: Do this, Shondra. You'll get some real money so you can quit this minimum wage crap and start up your business.
SHONDRA: What you payin'?
SEAN: A grand.
SHONDRA: Make it trey, we on.
SHONDRA: Or you can kiss my ass.
PJ: Deal.   Now how about those fries?
PJ: We're strapped now, my brother.
SEAN: They have everything we ordered?
PJ: Glocks, Uzis, Tec-9s...
SEAN: What the hell is that?
PJ: Oh, my hair? Shondra just did it. (off Sean's look) What? You hate it?
SEAN: No. I just think it's a choice my character would have made.
PJ: Don't go there, Sean. You're just jealous you didn't think of it first.
SEAN: Whatever.
SEAN: Okay, got the gangsta wear.
SEAN: What's so funny?
PJ: That wig, man! I didn't know this was Halloween. Bring me back some candy!
SEAN: Whatever.
SEAN: Gimme your ride, punk, or I will dust yo ass!
PJ: Nope, you're not convincing me. Remember your core character. You're an oppressed black man from the ghetto.
SEAN: Yeah, I know, I'm having trouble finding this one. Lemme try it again.  Gimme your ride, punk, or I will dust yo ass!
PJ: Add a 'beeyotch' and I think you're there.
BRAD: I'm thin to win! (raps to Monster) 'The name is B-Rad, Not Robbie Van Winkle... Go get my latte nonfat, And don't forget the sprinkle!'
BRAD: Yo, what up, fool?   I'm --
BRAD: Let me get them tig ol' bitties.
SHONDRA: Word up.
BARISTA: Can I help you?
SHONDRA: Coffee.
BARISTA: Tall, Grande, Venti, nonfat, soy --
SHONDRA: Big... (pointed) ...black.
BRAD: (to Barista) Yo, Krista the Barista. Put it on my account. (to Shondra) Get yourself a blueberry scizonne too, girl.
SHONDRA: Cool, playa.
SHONDRA: Compton.   You?
BRAD: The streets.
SHONDRA: Which streets?
BRAD: Malibu... Represent.
SHONDRA: Right. I guess it's pretty hardcore up in here.
BRAD: Hell yeah. (points to his crew) I'm down with the P.C.H. Hustlers. And dems over dere...
BRAD (O.S.): The Calabasis Crabs... and behind dem...
BRAD: ... the Palaside Pimps.
SHONDRA: Damn.   How do you deal?
BRAD: All day every day.
SHONDRA: Was that you droppin' rhymes when I came in?
SHONDRA: Mali-boo-tay, huh? Looks phat. You gettin' any air play?
BRAD: I'm holdin' out for Power 106. I sent Big Boy a CD, he just ain't gotten back to me yet.
SHONDRA: Sounds just like that fat fool. I'll talk to him 'bout it.
BRAD: (blown away) Hold dup? You know Big Boy?
SHONDRA: Hell yeah. I see him at the swap meet almost every Sunday.
BRAD: For rizzill?!
SHONDRA: For rizzeal.
BRAD: Yo.    Holler at him for me.
SHONDRA: I don't know. I guess you do kinda got it goin' on... It's funny. I was just on my way down to see him. Wanna roll with me?
BRAD: Now? (thinks) Well, tonight was my Seder dinner...
SHONDRA: Just helping out a brotha.
SHONDRA: I'm just gonna hit the ladies' room, a'ight, pimp juice?
BRAD: Yo, y'all, this fine dimey is hookin' me up with Big Boy hisself.
HADJI: Shut up!
BRAD: I ain't lyin'!
HADJI: Yo, but what about us?
BRAD: Start droppin' beats. Soon as I sign with Biggy, we gonna need some sick tracks.
HADJI: Bet!
SHONDRA: It's on.
SHONDRA: So what do you rap about?
SHONDRA: For real?
BRAD: Yeah, lemme kick it freestyle. (raps) 'Traffic, traffic, Lookin' for my Chap Stick, Feelin' kinda carsick, There's a Ford Maverick...' (back to talking) See? Dat's a million-dollar song right dare.
SHONDRA: So, how did you get to be so down?
BRAD: I been a playa all my life, girl. And I must say, of all the sisters I been wit', you de finest. So, you got a man?
SHONDRA: (bitter) I did, but I just got through kickin' his sorry ass to the curb. I ain't nobody's 'gangsta hoochie.' I am an entrepreneur.
BRAD: Word. (then) What's that?
SHONDRA: A businesswoman.
BRAD: Oh.
SHONDRA: One day I'ma have a chain of beauty salons all up in the 90210, just like Starbucks, only instead of coffee, with hair and nails. Makin' sick money turnin' all the rich hoochies ghetto fab.
SHONDRA: Thank you.
BRAD: For real, girl. You like a cross between Martha Stewart and Oprah. I'ma call you Mothrah.
SHONDRA: Take this exit.
BRAD: Yo. He really should use delivery.
SEAN: Gimme yo ride, punk, or I will dust yo ass... beeyotch!
BRAD: What?!
SEAN: You're gettin' jacked!   Move!
BRAD: Shondra?!
SHONDRA: Shut up, fool!
SEAN: No.    It's a stickup.
BRAD: I think I'm gonna throw up.
PJ: And I'm about to wet you up if you don't move!
BRAD: (meekly) Does this mean we're not going to Big Boy's?
PJ: Big Boy's?    What this fool talkin' about?!
SEAN: You jus' been kidnapped.
BRAD: Kidnapped?!
PJ: Yeah. We got your rich Gluckman ass now!
BRAD: How you know me?
SEAN: We saw you on the news the other night! (mocking) B-Rad!
PJ: Your papa's gonna pay or you're gonna pay!
MONSTER: Bam! Y'all owe me seven hundred dollars!
HADJI: A'ight, come on now, let's stop messing around. B told us to lay down some beats for the new album.
MONSTER: Lemme go free style.
HADJI: Free style, please! Your momma rap better than you.
MONSTER: Don't you talk about my momma.
HADJI: I'll talk about your momma all I want.
MONSTER: You ain't got the bizalls, bitch!
HADJI: Oh yeah? Peep dis. Your momma's so poor, when she shops at Barneys, she has to drive herself!
MOCHA: Oooh!
MONSTER: Yeah? Well your momma's so poor, when she went to Monte Carlo, she flew commercial.
MOCHA: Dang!
HADJI: Your momma's so poor, her round the world cruise ended in Spain!
MOCHA: Bam!
MONSTER: Your momma's so poor, when she stayed at the Four Seasons, she could only afford three.
PJ: Let's get him inside.
BRAD: Dang. Why you doin' this to a brother?
SEAN: A brother?
PJ: Oh no you didn't.
SEAN: Whose brother?
BRAD: Yours, y'all.    I'm down.
SEAN: Down?    God damn!
PJ: Uh-oh.    You done did it now.
SEAN: You are not black! You can never be black. And your perpetratin' ass is stealin' the only thing I got -- my culture!
PJ: What the hell makes you think you know what's goin' down in the 'hood?!
BRAD: I'm sorry.   Don't be hatin'.
SEAN: You a long way from the beach now, punk! You in South Central. The ghetto. The 'hood. It's hard core up in here! People here die every day!
LITTLE GIRL #1: Hey, Shondra! Can you come on by later? Princess just had her litter of puppies.
SHONDRA: (seeing Brad looking puzzled by this; waving) Okay then.
PJ: (covering) They're pit bulls.
SEAN: Mean pit bulls.
PJ: Now get ya ass inside.
SEAN: You got anything else on you, fool?
PJ: All that James Bond electronic crap can't save you now, fool. Sit ya ass down.
PJ: We gonna go call yo daddy.
SEAN: You better pray he home. If he not, you're one dusted trick!
SEAN: Did you buy my rage?
PJ: You're indicating.
SEAN: I'm indicating?
SEAN: (imitating back) 'If he not, you're one dusted trick!' Please!
SHONDRA: Would you two fools shut the hell up?
SEAN: Sure, Shondra, sorry. You're on. Go play good cop. We've gotta call Tom.
SHONDRA: You a'ight in here?
BRAD: Oh yeah. I just been kidnapped, carjacked, hands tied behind my back, but other than that, it's all good.
SHONDRA: Look, I'm sorry about all that, it wasn't my idea.
BRAD: I thought you liked me.
SHONDRA: I do.
BRAD: Then how come you set me up?
SHONDRA: I had to. They... (emotional) ... they threatened to kill me if I didn't play along.
SHONDRA: Oh yeah.   They straight-up killas.
BRAD: (even more wide-eyed) For Real?!
SHONDRA: Lemme school you on something, help you to stay alive, a'ight? The one thing they hate more than anything, that really sets them off, is posers.
BRAD: I feel you, girl, me too.
SHONDRA: I'm talkin' 'bout you!
BRAD: Me? But I hate posers! I got a Ph.D. -- a Poser-Hater Degree.
SHONDRA: Come on.   Quit frontin'.
BRAD: I ain't fron'in'.
SHONDRA: Listen to reason. If you just be a nice little white boy and say you're sorry, I think I can convince them to let you go.
BRAD: Damn. I am who I say I am. Why won't anyone believe me? This is a issue that's been comin' up a lot in my life lately.
PJ: How about... number three?
SEAN: Yeah, perfect. Let's take it to another level, my man.
SEAN: A'ight, we put the call in to yo pops, and you know what he said?
BRAD: Huh?
PJ: That he'd have to think about it.
BRAD: (incredulous) What?   Straight up?
PJ: He's not sure he wants you back, cuz.
SEAN: Can't see as I blame him.
BRAD: Come on, y'all, quit hatin'.   I'm just a rapper, that's it.
SEAN: Wigga please!
SEAN: Come on.
SEAN: I'ma teach this little white girl a lesson!
PJ: No, dawg, stick to the plan. Lay low here at the crib 'til we get the ransom.
SEAN: The plan just done changed, Tree. Wannabe claims he down, I'ma show him just how un-down he is.
SEAN: A'ight, Malibu, go get us six 40s of O.E.
PJ: And a fifth of Henny. (to Sean) Anything else?
BRAD: I'd like some Pringles.
SEAN: This ain't a picnic, bitch!
BRAD: I'm sorry, I'm sorry... y'all got some duckets, 'cause I'm tapped.
SEAN: You about to go up in there and give this Korean bitch yo ends? Hell no.
PJ: You jack that shit.
SEAN: And if the Asiatic gives you any static, show the brotha this...
PJ: Little trick claims he down, can't even swing a gat.
BRAD: But...
SEAN: Do it, punk, or I'll use that on you.
BRAD: Okay, a'ight, I'll do it.
BRAD: I feel you.
PJ: This is gonna be classic.
SEAN: He's gonna run out of there a scared little white boy.
KOREAN GUY: Yes?
BRAD: Yeah, uh, where the Old English at?
KOREAN GUY: Back there, under security camera.
BRAD: Thank you, sir.
KOREAN GUY: Can I help you?
BRAD: Naaw, but I'ma help myself to all this O.E., and whatever else I want!
KOREAN GUY: No, stop.
KOREAN GUY: Can I help you?
BRAD: (nervous) Let me axe you something.   Ever been robbed?
KOREAN GUY: Oh sure. Last week was my fifty- fourth time. But they were cool, no gun to head, never scream; you know, good people.
BRAD: Cool.
PJ: What are you talking about?
SEAN: (slowly) When you set this thing up yesterday, what did you pay?
PJ: I thought you set it up.
SEAN: You mean the owner doesn't know this is all fake?
PJ: Oh damn.
SEAN: Get in there!    He could get shot!
PJ: I'm not going in there!    You go in there!
BRAD: My emergency stash.    Thank you God.
KOREAN GUY: (cheerful) Glad you got cash, 'cause if you try to jack me, I was gonna have to lay you out wid dis...
KOREAN GUY: ... and wid dis.
KOREAN GUY: ... And wid dat.
BRAD: Keep the change.
KOREAN GUY: (ringing it up) Thank you very much. Come again.
BRAD: Uh, I know this is gonna sound wack, but what I'm about to do is just a joke, so don't shoot me, okay?
BRAD: That's right! Next time I'll bust a cap in yo trick ass!
PJ: Did he actually do it?
SEAN: This can't be happening.
BRAD: Let's dip!
SEAN: (incredulous) You did it?
BRAD: Straight up.   Trick didn't do nothin'.
PJ: Yo, what up with this?
PJ: If you jacked this, how come you got a receipt?
BRAD: I stole that too!
BILL: Terrific.   How's the Brad project doing?
TOM (O.S.): Smooth... he's in South Central.
BILL: And he's okay?
TOM (O.S.): He's in excellent hands.
SEAN: I've about had it, boy!
BRAD: Who you callin' boy?
SEAN: You got about five seconds to get real, or I'ma Timbo stomp your ass to de curb!
BRAD: What do you mean, get real?!
SEAN: Act your white self!
SEAN: Five!   Four!
BRAD: I guess I now know I can never be as cool as you guys. I promise I will never, ever front or act like a thug again, and I'm really really sorry if I offended you.
PJ: You buying it?
SEAN: I can't tell.
PJ: Me either.
SEAN: Let's give him the test.
SEAN: (off Brad's look) You a'ight, man?
BRAD: ("white" guy) Great, fine. Terrific popcorn.
BRAD: I'm sorry, y'all, but this is just who I am. I'm a rapper straight- up.
SEAN AND PJ: Wigga, please!
BRAD: No, for real. I can rap about anything. (goes into rap) 'Bloodbath and Tree, hang all day, They real tight, but they ain't gay... No, they okay...'
PJ: (incensed) You think you got mad skills, huh? Well, we'll see about dat.
SEAN: I done had it with you, fool. You better check yourself before you wreck yourself. This ain't Malibu!
BRAD: (sotto) Represent.
SEAN: Cube, Snoop, they all came up through here.
PJ: You want to prove yourself, this the place to do it.
SEAN: This is definitely gonna do it.
PJ: Pay day!
SEAN: How you feelin' now, Malibu?
BRAD: Finally, a place where I feel at home.
PJ: (disgusted) Get yo' ass in there.
SHONDRA: None of your damn bizness, Tec. Now let go.
TEC: Y'all been busy, huh?
SHONDRA: Too busy for you.
TEC: You been gettin' busy?
SHONDRA: Hell no.
TEC: Come on, girl, I'm cool.    Just tell me who it is.
SHONDRA: All you need to know is that it ain't you, okay?
TEC: You know, you ain't shit, Shondra. You're just a chickenhead, and that's all you'll ever be.
BRAD: What up, girl?!
SHONDRA: You a'ight?
TEC: Don't tell me you been hittin' that?
BRAD: Damn, man. Don't you know how to treat a lady? That's not nice.
SHONDRA: Brad, don't --

BRAD: Damn Shondra, where's the fire at?
SHONDRA: (fishing in her bag) You're going home.
BRAD: You settin' me free?
SHONDRA: No. I'm savin' your ass. I'm not havin' your blood on my hands. (hands him keys) It's the blue Honda across the street.
SHONDRA: Wait a second. Brad, don't do it.
BRAD: Shondra, I gots to do 'dis. this is my shot. I gotta prove myself.
SHONDRA: This is gonna be like an episode of 'Oz.'
YOUNG DRE: Nah, nah, nah... I ain't gonna battle no bitch. What am I? Ike Turner?
MC: A-ight, a-ight... We gotta do this. Yo, Saltine... Heads or tails?
BRAD: Tizzaizzlszzs!
BRAD: (apologetic) Tails... I want tails.
MC: You wanna go first?
BRAD: Nah... Ladies first.
MC: Whooo... GOD DAMN! Now, let's see if this Eminem melts in yo ass and in your hand.
BRAD: Can we start again?   I lost my place.
BRAD: I'm cool... I'm cool.
BRAD: 'You big and rough, You act all tough, I bet in your childhood You never had much love. (finishing) Alert the media, I'm a rap encyclopedia, My shrink says I suffer from a case of gansta-phrenia, I'm tryin' to be meania, I'm feeling much vigor, I'm the "Bu's" number one, hardcore NIGGAA!!!
PJ: (terrified, to SEAN) Let's get the hell out of here.
BRAD: I'm sorry...
SEAN: What was that?
SNUFFY: You gettin' played, ese.
TEC: Excuse me?
SNUFFY: (laughing) Loco boy hittin' your lady, homes, and she's diggin' it.
TEC: Yeah, Snuffy, that's right.
8-BALL: Not here, Tec.
TEC: A'ight, y'all, let's roll.
DEUCE: Whatchoo wanna do?
TEC: Bag me a white boy.
SEAN: Hey y'all, check this out. I can rap about anything! Haaa!!
PJ: Word. (bad white rapping) 'Listen, all you rappers, the name's Brad Gluckman. When on the mic you could say I really suck man!'
SHONDRA: A'ight, y'all had your fun, why don't you chill...
PJ: 'Cuz B-Rad G about to get ill!!!
BRAD: I just want to go home.
PJ: Uhn uhn, ain't happening. By the way, forgot to tell you. We heard from your pops, and guess what? He ain't payin'.
SEAN: He thinks y'all belong down here in the 'hood with us brothas, seein' how you so 'down' and all.
PJ: So, I guess that means we got to ice your punk ass.
BRAD: I don't care no more. I got nothin' to live for. Go ahead and smoke me.
VOICE (O.S.): Psst.   Hey, dawg.
BRAD: Huh?
VOICE (O.S.): Down here, dawg.
RAT: Negro, pleeeze. That little white rat ain't got nothin' on me -- yo, I'm Ronny rizat, represizzat.
BRAD: I ain't never seen no talking rat before. Although at the Malibu County Fair they had a chicken that played tic tac toe. Man, I hated losing to that chicken.
RAT: Why you so down, dog?
BRAD: I'm a failure.
RAT: Nah, nah it's not like that. You need to stop listening to what all them perpetrators is running and believe in yourself.
BRAD: For real?
RAT: For riz-real.    Pound it.
BRAD: So you saying if I put my mind to it I can be whatever I want to be?
RAT: Damn straight.
BRAD: I could be a highstylin' pimp?
RAT: They stylin-est.
BRAD: I could drive a mad '63 El Camino with 43-inch gold-plated dubs and a trunk full o' bitches?
BRAD: And I could be the biggest rapper in the world.
RAT: Rapper? Hell no! You stink! I'd rather eat garbage than listen to your tired ass rhymes. (thinks about it) Hmmm, garbage. That's making me hungry. Peace out.
SHONDRA: Hey...   You okay?
SHONDRA: You know, it's not as bad as it seems.
SHONDRA: You just need a little experience.
BRAD: I should've run when you gave me the chance.
SHONDRA: Naw. You were right. I respected you for getting' up there.
BRAD: But you heard 'em laughing.   I ain't nothin' but a busta.
SHONDRA: They just don't understand you. None of them know how hardcore it is up in... Malibu.
BRAD: (perking up) Yeah?
SHONDRA: Yeah with the... traffic, and the... parking, and...
BRAD: (getting excited) Like, when the public be all up in your private beach?
SHONDRA: Right. You just got to stick with it, you know, don't let anyone tell you who you are.
BRAD: Thanks, Shondra. (beat) You know what I was sayin', earlier, in the car, about being a playa and all? Well... I was just foolin'. I never been with a sister before.
BRAD: Except for on the internet.
SHONDRA: I never would've known.
BRAD: (shy) I think you about the finest girl I ever met in my whole life, and, well, since they gonna ice me in the morning, I was wondering... could I, kinda like, kiss you?
BRAD: You're so pretty.
SHONDRA: Thank you.
SHONDRA: I said kiss, fool. Damn.
SHONDRA: I offered you a snack, not the whole kitchen.
BRAD: I'm sorry.   I'm sorry.   I'm chill.
BRAD: Totally chill.
SHONDRA: A'ight, that's it, this game is lame. I want my money, and then y'all can get out.
PJ: But we're not done yet...
SHONDRA: You ain't never gonna be done. Did it ever occur to you two jackasses that this is the way he really is?
SEAN: No way.
PJ: Not possible.
SHONDRA: Whatever. Look, I did what you asked, and I want my money.
SEAN: Okay, I'll get it, you know, but settin' everything up was expensive, and I don't exactly have it right now.
SHONDRA: Excuse me?   You playin' me?
SHONDRA: Y'all get me my money now, or I'ma go in there and tell him what's up.
SEAN: Alright, okay, just relax...
SEAN: Your suggestions were really helpful. He totally bought the car jack and kidnapping...
SEAN (O.S.): ... we staged a fabulous liquor store robbery. Mr. Gluckman's going to be very happy...
SEAN (O.S.): But, he's still posing, so we wanted to put him in a drive-by shooting next... but, it's a little more money then our original projections...
TOM (V.O.): No deal. You get the rest when Richie Cunningham steps through the door here, and not one second sooner, understand?
SEAN: But -- Mr. Gibbons, hello?
BRAD: Damn... they been playin' me all along. How could dey do dat? How could she do dat? (getting angry) What-ever. If them fools wanna play, then let's play.
SHONDRA: What the hell do you think you're doing?
BRAD: Hey! Listen up... Brad G is in da hiz, and things gonna start changin' round here!
PJ: (to Sean) Do something.
SEAN: You must be out yo mind. Get back in that room before I beat your ass!
BRAD: You feelin' froggy, den leap!
BRAD: Anyone else wanna step?
SHONDRA: (slightly attracted) What the hell got into you?
BRAD: Shut up, ho.
BRAD: Yo, ho, the same ho that gave up that weak-ass kiss five minutes ago in the bedroom.
PJ: Really?   Damn.
SHONDRA: (pissed off) Who the hell do you think you are?
BRAD: I'm B-Rad G, from 'Bu, representin'! What y'all don't realize is that I was tryin' to put my mobbin' days behind me, but rollin' with y'all done re-awoke my inna killa. Let's start droppin' bodies!
SEAN: Come on, girl. Let's go!
SHONDRA: Uhn uhn. You created that monster, you deal with it.
PJ: But we got big a problem here.
SHONDRA: Until I see my money, it's your problem.
BRAD: I need to take a drive.
PJ: Come on, man.    Chill.
BRAD: Today is a good day to die, didn't have to use my A.K... (Ice Cube-like) Yey yey!
SEAN: Why you talkin' crazy?
BRAD: (getting in car) Might as well go out in a blaze of glory.  My daddy don't love me, my rhymes is played. I ain't down enough for y'all --
SEAN: (panicked) No.   You down, right PJ, er, Tree?
PJ: That's right, Bloodbath, he's very down. As down as they come.
SEAN: Oh my God.
TEC: Get out of the car, white boy.
BRAD: Oh, you dat weak fuck from de club.
BRAD: (not impressed) Got somethin' for me?
BRAD: Ain't that a coinky-dink? I was just talkin' to my homies about just dat...
TEC: Move!
BRAD: (getting out of car) A'ight, but y'all should change up your style, cuz these jackings is gettin' tired.
BRAD: Yo, Bloodbath, if there's one tiny scratch on my ride, I'ma eat y'all's children. (cheerfully) Shotgun!
TEC: Tape up this fool's hole, man.
TEC: What should we do with this Bloodbath and his friends?
SEAN: (panicked) I'm not Bloodbath! My real name is Sean James, I'm an actor. I swear!
TEC: Is Shondra hittin' the white boy?
SEAN: No way, man. She's in on the scam, just like us.
PJ: Yeah. We're all being paid to pretend to kidnap Bill Gluckman's kid.
TEC: Gluckman?   The dude runnin' for Governor.
SEAN: You've heard of him?
TEC: The dawg who's down with bitches and hoes? Hell yeah, I've heard of him. Just 'cause I live down here you think I'm ignorant?
PJ: We didn't say that, brother.
TEC: A'ight then. (looks at Brad) Damn, we got Gluckman's son. Fool's gotta be worth more alive than dead. (to his crew) Let's roll.
TOM: All the polls say that since Brad's been out of the picture we're up six points.
GARY: Gays too.
JEN: There's no way we can win without them.
TOM: Yep?
SECRETARY (V.O.): I have a Sean on the phone for you, sir.
TOM: Put it through.
SEAN: Tom, we have a real problem.
TOM: I told you, no more money.
SEAN: I know you said that, but we're in real serious troub --
TEC: Listen, fool. Gluckman's boy has been kidnapped for real, along with your punk friends.
TOM: Excuse me?
TOM: How do I know this is real?
TEC: You think your actors are this good?
SEAN: Help us, please... (hiccup) I'm... (hiccup) so... (hiccup) Scared!!!
TOM: Okay, I'm convinced.
TEC: Good.   Now get me my money.
TOM: Fine... Please don't do anything until I talk to Mr. Gluckman and arrange the finances.
TEC: You got ten minutes.
DEUCE: Now what?
TEC: We wait.
SNUFFY: Is that him, ese?
LOC: Yeah, that's Tec, homes, from the I-9's.
SNUFFY: Call Cyco, tell him to bring it all. We gonna have a party.
JEN: What the hell's going on?
TOM: Brad's been kidnapped for real.
BRETT: What?
TOM: They want five hundred grand or they'll kill him.
GARY: Oh my God.
TOM: Now let's not panic. Lemme just think this through for a minute. We could have a very interesting opportunity here.
BRETT: Where are you going with this?
TOM: Well, the negatives are obvious.
TOM: I can handle Bill. Let's brainstorm the positives.
JEN: There's so many. No more 'Brad problem.'
BRETT: Right, right, I'm liking it.
GARY: With a dead son, the sympathy factor could give us big spike in the female and gay demos.
BRETT: We've had such a problem with Bill's rich guy image, we could spin the issue to make him more 'Everymen,' you know, 'crime touches everyone,' like that.
TOM: What about a voter backlash, like how could he run on the heels of a tragedy?
GARY: No -- we push the 'courage under adversity' angle.
BRETT: Helps with his leadership profile.
JEN: Bill Gluckman, crusader/martyr...
BRETT: I've got the image -- Bill weeping over Brad's open casket.
GARY: Then, after grieving appropriately, he goes on the offensive...
GARY: ... drugs.
JEN: ... gangs.
BRETT: War's hot now.
GARY: War's great.
JEN: It's just what we've needed.
BRETT: It's like a green light to Sacramento.
TOM: Next stop, the White House.
TEC: What up?
TOM: No deal.
TEC: Say what?
TOM: Bill Gluckman does not make deals with criminals.
TEC: That's it, then, fool. I ain't playin'. His ass is done.
TEC: That's cold. (to crew) Lose the tape.
BRAD: God damn that hurts!!! I get out of this I'ma hafta teach y'all some manners!
TEC: Your daddy ain't payin'.
BRAD: Yeah, yeah, tell me somethin' I don't know!
TEC: What?
BRAD: You heard me, you half-steppin' moist-ass bitch!
BRAD: (fearless) Oh what, you gonna do me like this? A'ight, then bring it.
TEC: It's brought.
BRAD: Man up! Put this wannabe out of his misery.
BRAD: That gat's real, right?    Then do it or I'll do it myself
TEC: (unnerved) Brotha straight-up crazy, and I cannot deal with that shit.
TEC: Lay down some cover, fool!
8-BALL: We're tryin', man, but they're too strapped.
DEUCE: What the hell we gonna do?
BRAD: Punks.   Gimme dem gats.
BRAD: I'm B-Rad G, from the 'BU, y'all... (out Denzeling Denzel) King Kong ain't got nothin' on me! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
(STOPS FIRING): Damn. These special effects are the bomb! (resumes FIRING) Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!
SNUFFY: Devil's got some balls.
LOC: For real!   Let's dip!
BRAD: It's safe now, y'all.
TEC: That was ill!    Y'all definitely got juice.
TEC: Where'd you learn that shit?
BRAD: Damn.   Jus' MTV.
HAL FISHMAN: Good evening. A Channel Five exclusive. A security camera captured incredible footage of gang violence tonight, as it flared on the streets of South Central.
HAL FISHMAN (V.O.): This hardcore gangster, believed to be the notorious 'White Kong,' leader of I-9 street gang, fires his weapons with wanton disregard for human life or personal property.

MONSTER: But... what if they don't have coffee?
HADJI: Krista -- six Tsunamis to go!
BILL: Bradley's been involved in a gang shooting.
TOM: Are you positive?
BILL: His face was on the news, Tom!   I think I know my own son!
TOM: I'm sure there's a logical explanation. Why don't you get some sleep --
BILL: Sleep? He's shooting the hell out of South Central. We've got to get him!
TOM: What about the debate tomorrow in Sacramento --
BILL: Forget the debate!
TOM: If you cancel, you can kiss this campaign good-bye.
TOM: I understand you're upset, Bill, but Jesus, for once in your life think outside the box! We can make Brad's whole gang thing a positive...
BILL: (incredulous) A positive!
TOM: If he's arrested or, God forbid injured, we spin it so you are the victim, you know, 'crime reaches everyone,' something like that...
BILL: You're trying to get votes out of this?
TOM: I'm trying to win, Bill, and you don't seem to care!
BILL: I'm his father.
TOM: (laughs) When did that happen?
BILL: I guess right now.
BILL: You're fired.
TOM: All right, guys, let's pitch on how I get my job back.
BRETT: Just so you know, I never liked the way you ran things around here. (walking out) Bill? Mr. Gluckman?
HUMAN OPERATOR (V.O.): This is Lojack.
BILL: I need a location on license number... (reluctant)
'D-SHIZNIT.': That vehicle is at the corner of McKinley and 82nd.
TEC: That's yours, B.
BRAD: For real?   You shouldn't have.
TEC: Welcome to the 9's.     Only way out now, is in a box.
BRAD: In a box... right.

MOCHA: Shut up!   Damn posers!
MONSTER: Hadji, how 'bout you?
HADJI: Couldn't get much, yo...

MONSTER: Dang!   Where'd you get all dat?

BRAD: Why'd you play me, huh?
SHONDRA: For the money.

TEC: Who's the hell's poppin' ca --
BRAD: (terrified, covering) Ha ha, Tec, my road dawg, yeah, just the man I wanta see.
TEC: (to Shondra) What's goin' on, Shondra?
SHONDRA: (nervous) It's not what it looks like, Tec, I swear.
TEC: Don't you lie to me. That was always my line to you, and it always was what it looked like. Now what's up with your boyfriend here.
TEC: I do mind.
SHONDRA: No, Tec, stop!
BRAD: Wait, Tec, lemme explain, 'cause I don't belong here...
TEC: You done forgot already, fool? I told you the only one way out of the I-9s, and your 'E' ticket's in this here chamber.
SEAN: See how committed he is? That's the rage I was talking about.
PJ: (in awe) Word.
BRAD: Please, don't be hatin'.
SHONDRA: I won't let you do it, Tec.
TEC: No problem, then.   I'll just do the both of you.
TEC: Damn fool!   You just hit my house!
BILL: (ignoring him) Brad!   Are you okay?
BRAD: Not really. And unless you seriously strapped, you about to be not really okay too.
BILL: Hey there, fellas. Bill Gluckman... I'm running for governor.
DEUCE: You the candidate that's down with bitches and ho's.
TEC: Tsss. Dude think we ignorant just 'cause we live down here. You better recognize.
BILL: I absolutely recognize that street violence is tearing Californians apart... You see, guys, California is my family, and hey, here's a thought. Instead of thinking of ourselves as what set we're from, or what crew we're rolling with, why can't we just be brothers? What do you say?
TEC: (thoughtful) Hmmm. I guess I never looked at it like that before. What do you say, 'brothers'?
TEC: Don't anybody know where the driveway's at?! Damn!
HADJI: (freaking out) Better step, y'all, or I'ma have to waste all y'all up in this piece!
MONSTER: Yeah!   Drop yo gats!
BRAD: Hold dup, y'all. Before anybody ices anybody I got to say something.
BRAD: You really weren't gonna pay my ransom?
BILL: I didn't know anything about that. You've got to believe me, that was not part of the plan.
BRAD: What was the plan? Send me down here to scare me white?
BILL: It was stupid, I know. I thought I'd tried everything... I just didn't know how to deal with you anymore.
BRAD: You've never known how to deal with me 'cause you don't know me, and you never cared to find out. And now that your election's on the line, that's when you take a stand? That's bullshit, Pops. Look at me, 'cause this is who I am, and if you can't accept that, then I'll walk out that door, never see your sorry-ass again.
BILL: I'm not proud of myself, Brad. I made a lot of mistakes, and I know I wasn't there for you, and I can't change that, but I always loved you and still do...
BRAD: Talk is cheap, Pops.    Prove it.
BILL: I'm here, ain't I?
BRAD: A'ight, Pops, we cool.
BILL: Much love.
8-BALL: (sincere) Wish I could talk to my pops like that.
DEUCE: (emotional) No doubt. He's raising his kid.
8-BALL: (dialing his cell, wiping tears) I'ma call my pops right now.
TEC: Would y'all get a hold of your fool selves?! It's time to waste these punks!
TEC: (sighs) Whatchya got to say?
BRAD: Moch, kick it freestyle.
BRAD: 'What's up with all this fightin'? We all should be unitin'! Y'all egos need deflatin', Gangstas, please, quit all this hatin'.'
TEC: Stop, please! If I hear you drop one more rhyme, I'ma hafta smoke myself.
BRAD: A'ight, cool, but all these gats got to go!
MOCHA: (moved, earnest) Word up, B. All this hatin' is wack!
TEC: Ruuuuuuunnnnn!
TEC: I know my rights, man, and these fools drove two damn cars into my house, then they blew the shit up! This all better be rebuilt before my ma comes back, or she will make you wish you were never born.
REPORTER: I have two witnesses who were at the scene of the explosion...
REPORTER: Can you tell us what happened?
SEAN: (going for the   Oscar) See, the explosion was   just a metaphor for the anger   we oppressed young men of   color have buried deep inside our   hearts... hearts turned dark --
REPORTER: (confused) Okay, thank you, Bloodbath and Tree. (turns TO CAMERA) And all of this mayhem is rumored to have been caused by the mysterious White Kong, who remains at large. This is Soon Yi Baxter- Hernandez, reporting from South Central.
PJ: (speaking normally) When's this gonna air?
SEAN: Can I get a copy of this?     I need it for my reel.
BRAD: Aaah!!!
BRAD: I'm cool... still a little confused maybe. I'm still not exactly sure what was for real and what wasn't.
SHONDRA: Well, as far as being real, I can only vouch for two things.
BRAD: I can deal with a little more of that reality.
BRAD: Wait a minute. You said two things was real. What was the other?
BRAD: Damn, you knew Big Boy the whole time?
SHONDRA: I told you we go way back.
BIG BOY: So Shondra tells me you drop rhyme.
BRAD: Once you hear my demo, you're gonna want to give me Eminem play, dawg!
BIG BOY: (taking the CD) I can't wait, y'all. Peace.
BIG BOY: I know exactly what to do with this.
BIG BOY: Pull!
BRAD: Damn. Twenty thousand people, all here to support my pops. He must have charisma.
BRAD: Shondra, girl. I just have to thank you.
SHONDRA: For what?
BRAD: You the only one who accepted me for who I really am. (beat) You also car jacked me, kidnapped me and tried to turn me white, but I'm gonna let that go.
BILL: Hey, kids... Sorry to interrupt.
BRAD: (turning) What up?
BILL: Well, I'm about to go on and, Brad... I want you to be part of this.
BRAD: You mean, be onstage with you?
BILL: I need you to help me get the urban vote. Introduce me.
BRAD: Dang, I'd be honored.
BILL: And, son, don't say it... (beat) Rap it.
BRAD: (blown away) For real, Pops?
