OFFICER ERHMAN: Torrez sounds mad. You going to answer him? Machete glares. Erhman nervously picks up the radio.
TORREZ: ( ON RADIO )
OFFICER ERHMAN: What are you doing? We're going to set up a perimeter right? You heard the boss. Machete pulls his Machete, sticks it up to Erhman's face.
MACHETE: This is the boss. Ehrman crosses himself. A phalanx of ARMED GUARDS emerge from the dead cars. They narrow their weapons at MACHETE's barrelling patrolcar.
OFFICER ERHMAN: Hijo de puta! Machete FLOORS it directly through the DEAD CARS and right through the FRONT WALL of the fleapit.
MACHETE: Get dressed. He checks the windows. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 3.
CHICA: It's too hot for clothes. Checks her eyes. She's been drugged. He lifts her, ass over his shoulder.
CHICA: Oh. wow.
MACHETE: We need to go. Now.
CHICA: In what? That? The patrolcar isn't going anywhere. She rips open his shirt and rubs his tattoo. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 4.
MACHETE: My machete.
CHICA: Is it sharp? Machete looks into her eyes. She smiles drunkenly.
GIRL: Como hice? ( Sub: How'd I do? )
TORREZ: Bueno. pero no tanto. ( Sub: Good. but not that good. ) He shoots her once; she drops, then he empties the gun into her body, making her do a spider dance on the floor. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 5.
MACHETE: Torrez's boot connects with Machete's face and he goes backwards onto the floor. A SECOND MAN enters. This is DRUGLORD.
DRUGLORD: No, not Torrez. El Santo Muerte, pendejo. ( I'm Saint Death, pendejo. ) DRUGLORD draws a Samurai sword and SLICES Machete like carving meat. We don't see it.

She stretches, revealing tantalizing glimpses of her bod. She's having her "private time," caressing every inch of her body with a phallic loofah. She oohs and ahhs with the joys of pleasuring herself in the tub. Headlights appear through the venetian blinds. She stops. Sounds of people getting out of a car, laughing, shushing each other. Then a key in a lock, struggling to open it. A door forcibly opens. More sounds of fumbling and shushing.
ELEKTRA: Jesus, Sis. How long have you known this one? Twenty minutes?

LUZ: You get around. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 55. Machete lays the ten on the counter.
MACHETE: For the tacos and coffee. She reaches for the ten and Machete grabs her wrist, sees the sniper switchblade scar. She pulls away, slips the money between her breasts.

ELEKTRA: What do I do with this? Machete points to the hole in his shoulder.

BENZ: You want to be a martyr? I'm good at making martyrs. Booth raises the hammer.
PADRE: Like McLaughlin? RNewman / Endeavor Draft 66.
BENZ: That's right. In our own way, we can all be like Christ. Too bad for you, you chose the worst way. He slams another nail into Padre's other hand.

APPEARANCE ): Jesus, what happened to you?
BENZ: Nothing. Just had a little talk with a priest.
MCLAUGHLIN: Well, what am I going to tell `em?
BENZ: Whatever you tell them, I'm sure it'll be golden. ( off McLaughlin's blank
LOOK ): Just feed them the line about standing steadfast in the face of terrorism, continuing the fight. You know it by heart. McLaughlin looks relieved.
MCLAUGHLIN: I do. All right. Once this is done, you need to take a vacation. You need some air.

INSET ENDS: McLaughlin looks to Booth, but Booth is GONE.
MCLAUGHLIN: No further comment. Thank you. McLaughlin ducks back inside.
MCLAUGHLIN: Could somebody fucking help me? I think I'm having a heart attack. Booth takes hold of him and ushers him out the back door.
MCLAUGHLIN: What did you do, Booth? You jeopardized my career with that wetback! He could have fucking killed me!
BENZ: Not with that scope.
MCLAUGHLIN: You stupid sonofabitch. You pull something like this, without consulting me?! You fucked me. You are a stupid sonofabitch. The press is going to demand answers! You got another brilliant solution for They stop. Suddenly, MACHETE is standing on top of the limo. He's throwing knives into the open sunroof. McLaughlin is pinned to the seat.

MAN: Shouldn't you?
VON: Let him stew awhile. Von mutes the TV, answers the phone.

TORREZ: She was just a warmup. Now I'm ready for dessert. He edges in.
BENZ: Shut the gate quick! He's after me! Some of the men shut the gate. Booth approaches Von.
VON: And you led him right to Papa Von. That's some kind of thank you.
BENZ: I saw to it that McLaughlin gave you the keys to this fortress. You owe us.
VON: The senator, maybe. But what exactly do I owe you, turncoat?
BENZ: What are you talkin
VON: You held the hand that held the gun, Booth. Just as good as you killed him. Booth lunges for him but the other militia men hold him back.
BENZ: You can't do this to me, Von! You need me!
BENZ: Glory, glory, hallelujah.
TORREZ: Machete stops, turns to see Elektra, bound and gagged in Torrez's control.
TORREZ: All roads lead to Hell, eh, Machete squints. Flashes back to the earlier scene. The two images blur into one.
MACHETE: I was born in the fire. It wasn't RNewman / Endeavor Draft 83.
TORREZ: Faith? Yeah, faith got you a good job picking melons. While I bought the world.
MACHETE: What good is it.
TORREZ: ( IN SPANISH )
MACHETE: I'm still standing.Puta. Machete pulls out the blade, Torrez falls dead. EXPLOSIONS and black smoke light up the sky behind Machete.
MACHETE: What's the problem officer? The Officer just stands there, silent, his flashlight blinding in Machete's eyes.
ELEKTRA: What's your name?
MACHETE: I called in some favors. Look at this. All the right papers; a real identity. You could start over, be a real person. She puts the green card in his hand. Machete looks at it, then crumbles it and drops it.
ELEKTRA: I called in some favors. Look at this. All the right papers; a real identity. You could start over, be a real person. She puts the green card in his hand. Machete looks at it, then crumbles it and drops it.
MACHETE: Why do I want to be a real person. when I'm already a myth?
ELEKTRA: Where will you go?
MACHETE: Torrez was just an errand boy. I'm going to find the man who sent the Elektra steps into the headlights. She's dressed in hot COP
ELEKTRA: I'll ride with you. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 85. They kiss.
FADE UP: Machete and Elektra drive away on the gun bike. The cop car abandoned on the side of the road; lights still DESERT - NIGHT. A family of illegals crossing the border in the desert, see a WATER STATION up ahead. They make for it, opening it up and drinking heavily from the water supply. A BULLET brings one of them down and the others scramble for safety but there's someone out there, shooting at them. MOTHER hushes the younger ones.
FADE OUT: DISSOLVE TO:
MOTHER: Say a prayer to El Machete to protect you. The younger ones start to pray. A JEEP patrols the area and we see it's MINUTEMEN taking potshots at the illegals.
MILITIA MAN: Did you get `em?
2ND MINUTEMAN: I don't know. They're like brown jackrabbits. Let's see if they'll show their little white tails. Flicks on a highpowered light by the side mirrors on the
MILITIA MAN: Holy shit! His words gurgle in his throat as his head is severed from his body. 2nd MINUTEMAN freaks and makes a run for it. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 86. Stumbles in the dark, in the dust. Scrambles but can't get to his feet as he sees the outline of a DARK FIGURE above him. Young illegals' prayers continue as the MACHETE comes down on 2nd MINUTEMAN. Sounds of struggle, slaughter. then silence.
MACHETE: Light a candle. Say a prayer. Young illegal opens eyes. There's a glass candle in his hands, but no one else around. Instead of Christ or a Virgin on the candle is a silhouette of MACHETE.
