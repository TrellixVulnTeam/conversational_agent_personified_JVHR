GIL: If I'd have stayed the first time I came by now I'd be a Parisian.
GIL: I'm in love with you.
JOHN: There are our sight-seers.
INEZ: If I never see another charming boulevard or bistro -
GIL: What a town.
HELEN: To visit.
GIL: I could easily see myself as a Parisien - strolling the Left Bank - a baguette under my arm - finishing my novel - at a table at the Cafe Flore. A Moveable Feast - Hemingway called it.
HELEN: In this traffic nothing moves.
GIL: Well yes it was different then.
JOHN: Can we continue this talk of moveable feasts at Grand Vefour because I'm starved.
GIL: Americans eat dinner so early.
JOHN: And I'm proud of it.
HELEN: ( lifting wine glass ) A toast to John's new business venture here.
JOHN: Well I'll be perfectly frank - I'm excited over this corporate merger between our people and the French company but otherwise I'm not a big John hates their politics.
HELEN: John hates their politics.
JOHN: They've certainly been no friend to the united States.
GIL: ( amiably ) You can't say they weren't right in not backing Bush's moronic war in Please let's not get into that discussion yet again?
INEZ: Please let's not get into that discussion yet again?
GIL: There's nothing wrong with your father and I disagreeing. That's what democracy is. Your father defends the right wing of the Republican party and I happen to think they represent sub-mental Neanderthals. But we respect each other's views - am I right?
HELEN: Can we discuss the wedding plans? Your father's used his good offices with the opera to get some of the singers to attend and sing. I thought Puccini would be nice.
INEZ: Isn't that great Gil?
GIL: Just no Wagner. When she walks down the aisle not The Ride of the Valkyries. Hey look, I just want to say that I am politically bipartisan in that, in my view, to be a politician of any party one must of necessity be a whore.
INEZ: Just then another young couple pass the table and recognize Inez. PAUL and CAROL BATES.
PAUL: Paul! Carol- Paul and Carol Bates - Mom, Dad, you know Gil - you didn't mention you'd be here.
INEZ: Paul! Carol- Paul and Carol Bates - Mom, Dad, you know Gil - you didn't mention you'd be here.
CAROL: It was sudden. Paul got invited to lecture at the Sorbonne.
INEZ: Oh - how terrific. Dad's here on business and we free-loaded along.
PAUL: It's great. We can spend some time Don't we have a lot of commitments?
GIL: Don't we have a lot of commitments?
INEZ: What are you doing tomorrow? We're driving to Versailles.
CAROL: What are you doing tomorrow? We're driving to Versailles.
INEZ: I'm dying to see Versailles.
GIL: Don't we have something tomorrow? We were going to have lunch at the Brasserie Lipp. My old professor once actually saw James Joyce there. He said Joyce was eating sauerkraut and frankfurters.
INEZ: Is that the end of the story?
GIL: It is actually -
INEZ: We'd love to go with you guys. Versailles is beautiful - I have to see it Gil - it's perfect for you with your obsession with "les temps perdus" 路
GIL: Yes - but -
PAUL: It's such a lovely treat running into you here. A demain.
INEZ: ( as they do their I hope you're not going to be as anti-social tomorrow when we go to How was I anti-social?
GIL: How was I anti-social?
INEZ: It was so clear you didn't want to Well they're your friends and I can't say I'm as taken with him as you are.
GIL: Well they're your friends and I can't say I'm as taken with him as you are.
INEZ: He's brilliant. I used to have such a crush on him at college. And Carol's very bright.
GIL: I find him a pseudo-intellectual.
INEZ: I hardly think the Sorbo nne would have him lecturing if he's a pseudo- intellectual. You should give him your novel to read. I'm sure he'd be able to critique your writing and show you why you're having so much trouble.
GIL: I'm having trouble because I'm a Hollywood hack who never gave actual literature a real shot.
INEZ: ( said with her usual Gil, promise me if this book doesn't come off you'll give up beating your brains out and get back to what you do best.
PAUL: I believe Louis moved his court here in about 1682 - originally this was all swamp land - in fact, if I'm not mistaken, in old French the word Versailles means something like "terrain where the weeds have been pulled". The main structure is French classical style at its height - the work, I believe of Louis Le Vau, I think Mansart and Charles LeBrun I believe 路路路
INEZ: I think I could get used to a summer home like this.
PAUL: Me too except, remember, in those days they only had baths and I'm definitely a shower man.
CAROL: Where are you two planning to live after the wedding?
INEZ: We're looking in Malibu. We love where you live.
GIL: I keep trying to talk her into a little attic with a skylight in Paris -
CAROL: La Boheme.
PAUL: All that's missing is tuberculosis.
INEZ: He doesn't even know if he can write a novel. So far your track record's - you know - whereas, everyone likes your movies -
GIL: Yes movie scripts are easier.
INEZ: Tell them about the lead character in the book you're working on.
GIL: I don't like to discuss my work.
INEZ: Not the plot, just the lead character. He works in a nostalgia What's a nostalgia shop?
CAROL: What's a nostalgia shop?
PAUL: Not one of those stores that sells Shirley Temple dolls and old radios? I never know who buys that stuff - who'd want it.
INEZ: ( pointedly ) People who live in the past. Who think their lives would have been happier if they lived in an earlier And just what era would you have preferred to live in, Miniver ( teasing Gil ) Paris in the twenties - in the rain - when the rain wasn't acid rain.
PAUL: And just what era would you have preferred to live in, Miniver Paris in the twenties - in the rain - when the rain wasn't acid rain.
INEZ: ( teasing Gil ) Paris in the twenties - in the rain - when the rain wasn't acid rain.
PAUL: I see. And no global warming, no TV or suicide bombing, nuclear weapons, drug cartels.
CAROL: The usual menu of cliched horror Nostalgia is denial. Denial of the painful present.
PAUL: Nostalgia is denial. Denial of the painful present.
INEZ: He's a romantic. Gil would be just fine living in a perpetual state of The name for this fallacy is called, Golden Age thinking.
PAUL: The name for this fallacy is called, Golden Age thinking.
INEZ: The erroneous notion that a different time period was better than the one, one's living in. It's a flaw in the romantic imagination of those who find coping with the present too It's definitely the nicest ring we've seen.
PAUL: The erroneous notion that a different time period was better than the one, one's living in. It's a flaw in the romantic imagination of those who find coping with the present too It's definitely the nicest ring we've seen.
HELEN: It's definitely the nicest ring we've seen.
INEZ: I love a diamond wedding band. The way it sparkled they'll see it in the last row when he puts it on my This is going to be such an event, Inez. I only wish -
HELEN: This is going to be such an event, Inez. I only wish -
INEZ: ( cutting her off ) I don't want to keep going over it, Look, he's your choice. What can I Gil's smart and successful.
HELEN: Look, he's your choice. What can I Gil's smart and successful.
INEZ: Gil's smart and successful.
HELEN: And yet he talks of g1.v1.ng it up and moving here. That frightens The world is full of people who dream of writing the great American novel. Let me handle him.
INEZ: The world is full of people who dream of writing the great American novel. Let me handle him.
HELEN: You're father thinks you're comfortable with Gil because you can control him.
INEZ: He likes to please me - is that so terrible? Oh gosh - I have to go - Paul arranged a private tour of the Rodin Museum.
OMITTED: 12 12 13 13
GUIDE: This is, of course, Rodin's most famous statue. A cast of this work was placed next to his tomb. Rodin wished for it to serve as his headstone and epitaph.
PAUL: That would be in Meudon. He died of the flu if I'm not mistaken - 1917 I believe.
GUIDE: Exactly correct. You know your art history, monsieur. The design -
PAUL: ( cutting her off ) The Thinker is so powerful because he thinks not just with his brain - he thinks with every limb and muscle - you feel the ( to Gil ) He's so knowledgeable, isn't he?
INEZ: ( to Gil ) He's so knowledgeable, isn't he?
PAUL: So much of Rodin's work was influenced by his wife, Camille.
GUIDE: Yes, she was an influence - though Camille was not the wife but his Camille? No.
PAUL: Camille? No.
GUIDE: Yes. Rose was the wife.
PAUL: He never married Rose.
GUIDE: Yes, in the last year of their I think you're mistaken.
PAUL: I think you're mistaken.
CAROL: Are you arguing with the guide?
PAUL: 13 CONTD: ( 2 ) 13
I: 13 CONTD: ( 2 ) 13
GUIDE: Ah, non, non, je suis certaine.
GIL: I'm afraid she's right. I just read the recent two volume biography of Rodin - Rose was definitely the wife, Camille the You read that? Where did you read I did - no question. Camille- Don't forget, Dad invited you to join us at a wine tasting tonight.
PAUL: You read that? Where did you read I did - no question. Camille- Don't forget, Dad invited you to join us at a wine tasting tonight.
GIL: I did - no question. Camille- Don't forget, Dad invited you to join us at a wine tasting tonight.
INEZ: Don't forget, Dad invited you to join us at a wine tasting tonight.
CAROL: It'll be so fun. Paul's an expert on French wines.
INEZ: ( walking with Gil ) When did you read the biography of Me? Why would I read a biography of Rodin?
GIL: Me? Why would I read a biography of Rodin?
INEZ: ( tasting ) I can't tell the difference. They're both delicious.
JOHN: Take it easy Inez. Those little sips add up.
HELEN: You should talk, John - especially for someone who once advocated the boycott of french wines.
JOHN: I'll always take a California wine but the Napa Valley is six thousand miles away.
INEZ: ( to Gil ) Which do you prefer?
GIL: To me they're all great. What the hell do I know?
INEZ: I don't think I've ever seen your cheeks so red.
GIL: Pheromones, it's your pheromones.
PAUL: Ah yes - sex and alcohol - It fuels the desire but kills the performance - according to the Have you tasted the '61? It's divine - though Paul found it - Slightly more tannic than the '59. I prefer a smoky feeling to a fruity feeling, don't you agree?
CAROL: Have you tasted the '61? It's divine - though Paul found it - Slightly more tannic than the '59. I prefer a smoky feeling to a fruity feeling, don't you agree?
PAUL: Slightly more tannic than the '59. I prefer a smoky feeling to a fruity feeling, don't you agree?
GIL: You will admit she's a sexy woman.
PAUL: This I have known for many years. You're a very lucky man.
GIL: ( a bit high ) To the little green Heinz pickle Carol and I are going to go dancing - we heard of a great place. I don't want to be a party pooper but I just want fresh air.
PAUL: Carol and I are going to go dancing - we heard of a great place. I don't want to be a party pooper but I just want fresh air.
INEZ: I don't want to be a party pooper but I just want fresh air.
GIL: I don't want to be a party pooper but I just want fresh air.
INEZ: Oh come on - although if you're just going to sit there and obsess over where the fire exits are.
CAROL: If Gil doesn't want to go, I'll share Paul with you. I'm very democratic. And he's a marvelous If it's okay with you, I'd really just like a little walk and go to bed. We can do it another night.
GIL: If it's okay with you, I'd really just like a little walk and go to bed. We can do it another night.
INEZ: Well I can go, right?
GIL: You go?
INEZ: I'm not tired and I'm dying to dance. I'll just meet you back at the hotel.
PAUL: I'll take good care of her.
GIL: I - I - guess so 路路路
INEZ: Isn't it great we're all on holiday at the same time.
CAROL: Back home we just joined a marvelous tennis club and Paul says you play. Does Gil?
INEZ: I can't introduce him to tennis - Daddy's having the damndest time pressuring him to learn golf.
PAUL: Is he a good writer? Have you read his prose?
INEZ: He won't let anybody -
PAUL: If he wants I'd be glad to go over his novel and critique it for him.
INEZ: That's what he needs, to have it read by someone who really knows and wouldn't pull any punches. The problem is - when it comes to his writing he has no respect for anyone's opinion.
DOUG: Come on - get in.
GIL: ( speaking with French Let's go, we're late.
DENISE: ( speaking with French Let's go, we're late.
GIL: You have the wrong person.
DENISE: Mais non, pas de tout - allez montez -
GIL: Look, I'm a little drunk -
DOUG: C'mon - for god's sake - we can't sit here all night.
GIL: This is a great old peugeot. I have a friend in Beverly Hills who has the same one - he collects -
DENISE: Let's go. We have so many parties to go to.
GIL: What parties?
DOUG: Venez - la prochain gauche.
DENISE: Here - you need some champagne -
GIL: Where are we going?
PHIL: 36 rue de ( tbd address ) and lets It's not fair - my head is swimming from wine.

GIL: I do like champagne.
DENISE: The night is young - drink up, drink up, drink up.
GIL: I'm drinking up.
ZELDA: ( glass in hand drinking ) You look lost.
GIL: You're American.
ZELDA: If you count Alabama as America which I do. I miss the bathtub gin. What do you do?
GIL: Oh I - I'm a writer.
ZELDA: What do you write?
GIL: Right now I'm working on a novel.
ZELDA: Oh yes? I'm Zelda by the way. Oh Scott - Scott come over here. Here's a writer from, where?
GIL: ( Scott joins ) Scott Fitzgerald, and who are you old sport?
SCOTT: ( Scott joins ) Scott Fitzgerald, and who are you old sport?
GIL: I'm Gil Pen - oh you two have the same names as -
SCOTT: As what?
GIL: Scott Fitzgerald and -
SCOTT: ( drinking ) Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. The Fitzgeralds. Isn't she beautiful?
GIL: Yes - its a coincidence. I mean it is a funny coincidence.
ZELDA: You have a glazed look in your eye. Stunned, stupefied, anesthetized, lobotomized -
GIL: I - I - I keep thinking that man at the piano - believe it or not I recognize his face from some old sheet music - what am I talking about here?
ZELDA: I know if I put my mind to it I could be one of the great writers of musical lyrics not that I can write melodies - and I try - and then I hear the songs he writes and I realize I'll never write a great lyric and that my talent really lies in drinking.
GIL: Yes but - he didn't write that song - did he? That's not possible -
SCOTT: What kind of books do you write?
GIL: I - I - I - I'm - I'm working on a - exactly where am I?
SCOTT: I'm sorry - Don't you know the host? Some friends have gotten together a little party for Jean CONTD: ( 2 )
GIL: ( looks around, drinks it Hey lady, are you kidding me?
ZELDA: I know what you're thinking - this is boring - I agree - I'm ready to move on - let's do Bricktop's, Scott, I'm bored, he's bored, we're all bored.
SCOTT: Whatever you say, sweetheart. See if Cole and Linda want to come with. Coming?
A24: Group entering cafe.
ZELDA: Une bouteille de bourbon.
SCOTT: ( stops at another table ) Greetings and salutations. You'll forgive me - I've been mixing grain and grappa 路路路 This is Gil - Gil? Yes, Gil.
GIL: Gil Pender.
HEMINGWAY: Hemingway? Hey, is this some kind of a -
GIL: Hemingway? Hey, is this some kind of a -
HEMINGWAY: You liked my book?
GIL: Liked - I loved - everything you wrote -
HEMINGWAY: Yes it was a good book because it was an honest book and that's what war does to men and there's nothing fine and noble about dying in the mud unless you die gracefully and then it's not only noble but brave.
GIL: Ernest Hemingway - this is - I -
HEMINGWAY: ( introduces his drinking Say hello to Pender - the bulls in the ring don't frighten Belmonte - he's killed many brave ones. Fine brave bulls.
GIL: I'm sure - good bulls, true bulls 路路路
HEMINGWAY: Why are you smiling?
SCOTT: ( drinks ) In New York you can't buy this - it can only be made in a bathtub - and some of the bathtub mixtures are damn good - ( to Zelda ) Isn't that so? She prefers her hootch from a homemade still - more ( to Hemingway ) Did you read my story? What did you think?
ZELDA: ( to Hemingway ) Did you read my story? What did you think?
HEMINGWAY: It began well - really well - then it became weak.
ZELDA: I might've known you'd hate it.
SCOTT: Darling you're too sensitive.
ZELDA: You liked the story but he hates There was some fine writing but it was not fulfilled.
HEMINGWAY: There was some fine writing but it was not fulfilled.
SCOTT: Please old sport - you make matters extremely difficult.
ZELDA: I'm jumpy - suddenly I don't like the atmosphere here anymore. Where are you going?
JUAN BELMONTE: Para reunirse con amigos en el St. Germain .
ZELDA: He's going to St. Germain. I'm going with him.
SCOTT: Zelda -
ZELDA: If you're going to stay and drink with him I'm going with the Get her back at a reasonable time.
SCOTT: ( to a polite Belmonte ) Get her back at a reasonable time.
HEMINGWAY: She'll drive you crazy, this woman.
SCOTT: She's exciting - and she has This month it's writing, last month it was something else. You're a writer - you need time to write - not all this playing around - she's wasting you - because she's really a competitor - don't you agree?
HEMINGWAY: This month it's writing, last month it was something else. You're a writer - you need time to write - not all this playing around - she's wasting you - because she's really a competitor - don't you agree?
GIL: Me? I just met -
HEMINGWAY: Speak up for Christ's sake. I'm asking you if you think my friend is making a tragic mistake.
GIL: Actually I don't know the Fitzgeralds that well -
HEMINGWAY: You're a writer - you make observations - you were with them all night.
SCOTT: Can we not discuss my personal life in public?
HEMINGWAY: She has him on yachts, at parties, jumping into swimming pools you're wasting your talent.
SCOTT: You don't understand her.
HEMINGWAY: ( to Gil ) She's jealous of his gift and it's a damn fine gift. It's rare. You like his work? You can speak Stop it.
SCOTT: Stop it.
HEMINGWAY: You like Mark Twain?
GIL: I do - very much.
SCOTT: I'm going to find Zelda. I don't like the thought of her with the
HEMINGWAY: He's a fine writer, Fitzgerald. You box?
GIL: What are you writing?
HEMINGWAY: What are you writing?
GIL: A novel.
HEMINGWAY: About what?
GIL: A man who works in a nostalgia What the hell's a nostalgia shop?
HEMINGWAY: What the hell's a nostalgia shop?
GIL: Where they sell old things - memorabilia. Does that sound terrible to you?
HEMINGWAY: No subject is terrible if the story is true. If the prose is clean and honest and if it affirms courage and grace under pressure.
GIL: Would you do me the biggest favor in the world - I can't even ask 路路路
HEMINGWAY: Would you read it?
GIL: Would you read it?
HEMINGWAY: Your novel?
GIL: It's only about four hundred pages - if you could just give me your My opinion is I hate it.
HEMINGWAY: My opinion is I hate it.
GIL: You do?
HEMINGWAY: If it's bad I'll hate it because I hate bad writing and if it's good I'll be envious and hate it all the more. You don't want the opinion of another writer.
GIL: But there's no one I really trust to evaluate it -
HEMINGWAY: Writers are competitive.
GIL: I could never compete with you -
HEMINGWAY: You're too self-effacing - it's not manly. If you're a writer, declare yourself the best writer - but you're not the best as long as I'm around. Unless you want to put the gloves on and settle it.
GIL: No - no - that's okay -
HEMINGWAY: I won't read your novel but I'll tell you what I'll do.
GIL: I'll bring it over to Gertrude Stein. She's the only one I trust to read my work. No one discovers new talent like Gert - whether it's poetry, painting, music - She'll tell you if you have a book or not.
HEMINGWAY: I'll bring it over to Gertrude Stein. She's the only one I trust to read my work. No one discovers new talent like Gert - whether it's poetry, painting, music - She'll tell you if you have a book or not.
GIL: You could have Gertrude Stein read my novel?
HEMINGWAY: Give it to me.
GIL: I have to get it. It's at the She gets back from Spain tomorrow.
HEMINGWAY: She gets back from Spain tomorrow.
GIL: ( rises ) I'm so thrilled - my heart is beating. I'll go home and get it - I'll give it to you - I can't tell you what this means to me. To have Gertrude Stein read my novel - thank you, thank you -
GIL: Calm yourself - get a grip, Gil - deep breaths - been quite a night - Fitzgerald - Hemingway - the Hemingway - Papa - where do I meet him - he never said.
INEZ: Lucky you didn't go last night. You'd have hated the music and the crowd - but I had fun.
GIL: What are you thinking? You seem in a daze.
INEZ: What are you thinking? You seem in a daze.
GIL: If I told you I was with Ernest Hemingway and Scott Fitzgerald last night, what would you say?
INEZ: Is that what you were dreaming about? Your literary idols.
GIL: But if I wasn't dreaming -
INEZ: What does that mean?
GIL: If I told you I spent time with Hemingway and Fitzgerald and Cole Porter -
INEZ: I'd be thinking brain tumor.
GIL: Can I tell you Zelda Fitzgerald is exactly as we've come to know her from articles and books - she's mercurial and moody and she does not get along with Hemingway - and Scott knows Hemingway's right about it but you can see how conflicted he is because he loves her -
INEZ: Right, right - er where's my cold cream - we should knock off the idle chatter because we're going to be late.
GIL: Actually I wanted to stay and work on my novel - it needs a little You can work on it later. And we can use Mom's decorator's discount.
INEZ: You can work on it later. And we can use Mom's decorator's discount.
HELEN: Come look at this Inez - wouldn't this be charming for a Malibu beach Dix-huit mille.
OWNER: Dix-huit mille.
HELEN: ( to Inez ) It's a steal at eighteen thousand Eighteen thousand dollars?
GIL: Eighteen thousand dollars?
HELEN: Oh wait, that's Euros so it's more -
INEZ: That's over twenty thousand dollars, Mom.
HELEN: Yes but it's very hard to find anything like this at home.
INEZ: She's right, Gil.
GIL: Yes but we haven't even found a house yet and I'm trying to keep expenses down so I can turn down You get what you pay for. Cheap is I know you love Malibu but -
HELEN: You get what you pay for. Cheap is I know you love Malibu but -
GIL: I know you love Malibu but -
INEZ: ( sotto seductively ) Did you ever make love in a chaise like this? Imagine the Er - of course when you think of it that way it does help amortize the eighteen grand.
GIL: Er - of course when you think of it that way it does help amortize the eighteen grand.
HELEN: And don't forget - we're taking you to dinner tonight at ( tbd ).
INEZ: ( sotto to Inez ) And after I have a terrific surprise for you.
GIL: ( sotto to Inez ) And after I have a terrific surprise for you.
INEZ: What? I'm not big on surprises.
GIL: You will be. Believe me.
HELEN: Look at these marvelous Blackamoors. I see them in your living room.
INEZ: Where are you taking me? You made me rush through dinner. Dad wasn't finished with his profiteroles.
GIL: You're going on one of the most amazing adventures of your life.
INEZ: Where? And why are you carrying around your manuscript.
GIL: You'll see - you'll see - and your jaw will drop.
INEZ: I don't know what it is you're carrying on about but this is not my idea of an amazing adventure. I'm exhausted from the gym and the Look - you want to walk the streets and "drink in Paris by night" - go ahead. I'm in the middle of a great book Carol lent me and if I'm asleep when you get in, don't wake

GIL: ( to himself ) What am I doing wrong? Unless she's right and I need to see a neurologist. Left the wine tasting - a little high yes - right here.
HEMINGWAY: The assignment was to take the hill. There were four of us.
GIL: Weren't you scared?
HEMINGWAY: Of what?
GIL: Getting killed.
HEMINGWAY: You'll never write well if you fear dying. Do you?
GIL: It's my biggest fear.
HEMINGWAY: But it's something all men before you have done and all men will do.
GIL: Yes but -
HEMINGWAY: Have you ever made love to a truly great woman?
GIL: My fiance is very sexy.
HEMINGWAY: And when you make love to her you feel true and beautiful passion and you at least for that moment lose your fear of death.
GIL: I don't know about that -
HEMINGWAY: I believe that love that's true and real creates a respite from death. All cowardice comes from not loving or not loving well which is the same thing and when the man who is brave and true looks death squarely in the face like some rhino hunters I know or Belmonte who is truly brave, it is because they love with sufficient passion to push death out of their minds till it returns as it does to all men and then you must make really good love again. Think about it.
HEMINGWAY: This is Gil Pender. He's a young American writer. I thought you two should know each other.
STEIN: I'm glad you're here. You can help decide which of us is right and which of us is wrong.
GIL: Pablo Picasso.
STEIN: Pablo Picasso.
STEIN: I was just telling Pablo that this portrait doesn't capture Adriana. It has universality but no Vous ne le comprenez pas correctment. Vous ne connaissez pas Adriana mais c'est tout ce qui la represente.
PABLO: Vous ne le comprenez pas correctment. Vous ne connaissez pas Adriana mais c'est tout ce qui la represente.
STEIN: No tu n'a pas raison. Look how he's done her - dripping with sexual innuendo. Carnal to the point of smoldering and yes she's beautiful but it's a subtle beauty - an implied sensuality. What is your first impression of 路路路路路 Exceptionally lovely.
GIL: ( very taken ) 路路路路路 Exceptionally lovely.
STEIN: Belle, mais plus subtil plus implicite, Pablo.
HEMINGWAY: You're right Gertrude - of course you can see why he's lost his
STEIN: You've made a creation of Place Pigalle, a whore with volcanic Mais c'est comme elle est, si vous la connaissez.
PABLO: Mais c'est comme elle est, si vous la connaissez.
STEIN: Yes - avec vous en prive - because she's your lover - but we don't know her that way - so you make a petit bourgeoise judgment and turn her into an object of pleasure.
PABLO: ( waves her off and goes to Je ne suis pas d'accord.
STEIN: ( turning to Gil ) And what about this book of yours I've been hearing about? ( to Hemingway ) Have you read it?
HEMINGWAY: No, this I leave to you. You've always been the best judge of my "Out of the Past was the name of the store and its products consisted of memories. What was prosaic and even vulgar to one generation had been transmuted by the mere passing of years to a status at once magical and also camp. "
STEIN: ( thumbing first page, she "Out of the Past was the name of the store and its products consisted of memories. What was prosaic and even vulgar to one generation had been transmuted by the mere passing of years to a status at once magical and also camp. "
ADRIANA: I love it. I'm already - hooked? I'll start it tonight. But first we have something to talk about.
STEIN: I'll start it tonight. But first we have something to talk about.
GIL: Did my opening lines really get to you that strongly?
ADRIANA: The past has always had a great charisma for me.
GIL: Me too. I was born too late.
ADRIANA: Oui, exactement. For me Belle Epoque Paris would have been perfect. The whole sensibility, the street lamps, the kiosks - the horse and carriages. And Maxims - You speak very good English.
GIL: You speak very good English.
ADRIANA: No, not really.
GIL: Yes - and how long have you been dating Picasso? My god, did I say Oh - I - no, I didn't mean anything - you know - to pry 路路路 born in I was born in Bordeaux - I moved here to study fashion and - you don't want to hear this -

PAUL: The juxtaposition of color is amazing. This man was the real father of abstract expressionism. I take that back, maybe Turner.
INEZ: I prefer Monet. I mean I love Turner but this is overwhelming.
PAUL: If I'm not mistaken it took him two years to complete this. And he worked out at Giverny - where he frequently -

STEIN: Oh yes, they've been back for days. The trip didn't work out. I knew they wouldn't hit it off. That's over. with Picasso too. She's at Deyrolles - by herself.
GIL: By herself?
STEIN: On of those surrealist painters is getting married and they did it up there. She'll be glad to see you.
ADRIANA: Oh - what are you doing here?
GIL: I came to find you.
ADRIANA: You did?
GIL: Let's just say as a writer I see into women's souls and I sense that you have very complicated feelings towards me.
ADRIANA: But you're going to be married.
GIL: I'm not so sure about anything anymore - can we just go where it's
GIL: A group of people are at a formal dinner party and after dinner when they try to leave the room, they Why not?
GIL: They just can't seem to exit the But why?
GIL: And because they're all forced to stay together the veneer of civilization quickly comes off them and they behave as who they really are - animals. But I don't get it - why don't they just walk out of the room?
GIL: Just think about it - that's all I'm saying - maybe one day you'll be shaving and it'll tickle your I don't understand - what's holding them in the room?
ADRIANA: What are you doing?
GIL: I don't know but I do know that for a brief moment, when I was doing it, I felt - immortal.
ADRIANA: But - you look so sad.
GIL: Because life is too mysterious for It's the time we live in. Everything moves so fast - life is noisy and complicated - not like the Belle Epoque. In those years Paris lived only for beauty.
ADRIANA: It's the time we live in. Everything moves so fast - life is noisy and complicated - not like the Belle Epoque. In those years Paris lived only for beauty.
GIL: I've always been a logical person. I never took chances - did anything crazy - like move here when I first came or take a shot at being a real writer, not a Hollywood hired hand - but I feel like letting everything
GIL: How remarkable - they're beautiful.
ADRIANA: How remarkable - they're beautiful.
DIDIER: Monsieur, mademoiselle - on y vas.
ADRIANA: What? Who are you?
CHLOE: Montez. On y vas. Nous allons etre en retard.

GIL: I don't know what it is about this city but I must write a thank you note to the chamber of commerce.
MARIE: Welcome - and oh what marvelous outfits. So avant garde - please have some champagne.
ADRIANA: I can't believe this is happening to me.
ADRIANA: I never want to go back to the present. Never.
GIL: The present - Yes, the present always seems worse than the past but it can't be - to always think this generation is stupider and coarser than the last - and yet - here we are at Maxims tonight and yes, it's fabulous.
ADRIANA: And I know just where I want to go
ADRIANA: ( to waiter ) Encore du vin. Le meme chose. ( to Gil ) Isn't this something. Lookl Look I
ADRIANA: Pablo worships him. I have to say hello. Come with me, I'm nervous.
GIL: We shouldn't bother him.
ADRIANA: But we know he's a lonely man 路路路 he longs for company.
ADRIANA: We're both great admirers of your work. Nous sommes tout les deux de grands admirateurs de votre Merci madame.

GIL: Parlez Anglais?
DEGAS: No monsieur.
LAUTREC: ( referring to Gauguin ) 11 parle un petit peut.
GAUGUIN: I speak well - je parle tres bien.
DEGAS: ( scornfully over Gauguin's Degas and I were just talking about how - cette generation est depourvue de sens et mangue He says they find this generation sterile and empty -
GAUGUIN: Degas and I were just talking about how - cette generation est depourvue de sens et mangue He says they find this generation sterile and empty -
ADRIANA: He says they find this generation sterile and empty -
GAUGUIN: La Renaissance est beaucoup mieux - better to have lived during the No - this is the Golden Age - L'Age Pas do tout - la Renaissance - c'etait mieux - leur vetements sont tres, tres modernes, tres He says your clothes are very modern and original.
ADRIANA: No - this is the Golden Age - L'Age Pas do tout - la Renaissance - c'etait mieux - leur vetements sont tres, tres modernes, tres He says your clothes are very modern and original.
DEGAS: Pas do tout - la Renaissance - c'etait mieux - leur vetements sont tres, tres modernes, tres He says your clothes are very modern and original.
ADRIANA: He says your clothes are very modern and original.
GIL: Er - yes - Monsieur Lauren - Ralph. Shouldn't you be in Tahiti?
GAUGUIN: I? What? Yes - I live on the island - a much better life than here - better there - but then I miss Paris - up and back - Qu'est que vous faites dans la vie?
ADRIANA: What do I do? Je suis etudiante. En haute couture - fashion designer but studying -
DEGAS: Ah ga compte pour les vetements Vous devriez la presenter a He wants Degas to have you meet his friend Richard.
LAUTREC: Vous devriez la presenter a He wants Degas to have you meet his friend Richard.
GAUGUIN: He wants Degas to have you meet his friend Richard.
ADRIANA: Ballet costumes - my god - I don't live here. I mean I do but I don't. Je n'habite pas ici.
GIL: I wouldn't get into too many details with them. Let's just leave it that we're temporarily passing through.
ADRIANA: ( to Gil ) Can I speak with you a minute? ( to table ) Permettez-moi de m'absenter un ( she gets him off ) Let's never go back to the What are you talking about?
GIL: What are you talking about?
ADRIANA: I think we should stay here - it's the start of the Belle Epoque - this is the greatest, most beautiful era Paris has ever known.
GIL: But I love the Jazz Age.
ADRIANA: The twenties are full of strife and uncertainty. But think of it, Gil - the two of us - in a lovely art nouveau home - I'll work in the fashion world - I love the styles - you can write 路路路 it's the age of Debussy and Guimard. Maybe you can meet Balzac.
GIL: But what happened to the twenties and the Charleston and Cole Porter?
ADRIANA: That's the present, it's dull.
GIL: It's not the present for me - I'm from 2010.
ADRIANA: What do you mean?
GIL: I dropped in on you just the way we dropped in on the 1890's.
ADRIANA: You did?
GIL: I wanted to escape my present just like you wanted to escape yours. To a golden age.
ADRIANA: Surely you don't think the twenties are a golden age?
GIL: To me they are.
ADRIANA: But I'm from the twenties and I'm tellin~ you the golden age is the Belle Epoque.
GIL: Yes but don't you see - to these guys the golden age was the Renaissance. They'd all trade the Belle Epoque to paint alongside Michelangelo or Titian. And those guys probably imagine life was better when Kubla Khan was around. I'm having an insight. A minor one but that accounts for the anxiety of my dream.
ADRIANA: What dream?
GIL: Last night I dreamed I ran out of zithromax - and then I went to the dentist and there was no novacaine - these people have no antibiotics -
ADRIANA: What are you talking about?
GIL: And even in the twenties - no dishwashers - no 911 if your appendix bursts - no "movies on demand" 路
ADRIANA: But if we love each other what does it matter when we live?
GIL: Because if you stay here and this becomes your present, sooner or later you'll imagine another time was really the golden time. And so will I - I'm beginning to see why it can't work, Adriana. The present has a hold on you because it's your present and while there's never any progress in the most important things, you get to appreciate - what little progress is made - the internet - Pepto- Bismol. The present is always going to seem unsatisfying because life itself is unsatisfying - that's why Gauguin goes back and forth between Paris and Tahiti, searching - it's my job as a writer to try and come up with reasons why despite life being tragic and unsatisfying, it's still worth it.
ADRIANA: That's the problem with writers - you're all so full of words - but I'm more emotional. I'm going to stay and live in Paris' most glorious time. You made a choice to leave Paris once and you regretted it.
GIL: Yes, that one I regretted but it was a real choice and I made the wrong one. This is a choice between accepting reality or surreal insanity.
ADRIANA: So finally you do love Inez more than me.
GIL: No - I love you - but this way lies madness - and if I'm ever going to write anything worthwhile I've got to get rid of my illusions and that I'd be happier in the past is one of them.
ADRIANA: Goodbye, Gil.
GIL: Goodbye Adriana. Good luck.
STEIN: Ah - Pender - I read your rewrite. Yes 路路路 you're nicely on the right track. You've understood me clearly. If the rest of the book reads as well when you're done you'll have something of value.
GIL: ( taking it back ) Thank you. I can't tell you how much this means to me.
STEIN: Hemingway who read your chapters and agrees it's going to be a fine book did have one plot suggestion.
GIL: Hemingway read it? What was his He finds it hard to believe the protagonist doesn't see his fiancee is having an affair that's going on right before his eyes.
STEIN: He finds it hard to believe the protagonist doesn't see his fiancee is having an affair that's going on right before his eyes.
GIL: with -
STEIN: The other character - the pedantic one -
GIL: It's called denial. Thanks again. You're Ezra Pound right? T.S. Eliot says you owe him forty
INEZ: You're crazy - Paul and me? Where did you get such an insane notion?
GIL: From Ernest Hemingway. He thought it out and it makes perfect sense.
INEZ: Gil, your brain tumor's acting up There's nothing crazy about Ernest Hemingway or Gertrude Stein or Fitzgerald or Salvador Dali -
GIL: There's nothing crazy about Ernest Hemingway or Gertrude Stein or Fitzgerald or Salvador Dali -
INEZ: Nothing except they've all been dead for years.
GIL: It was William Faulkner who said, the past is not dead.
INEZ: You're a raving lunatic.
GIL: I guess I'm too trusting. I'm jealous and also trusting - cognitive dissonance, Scott Fitzgerald speaks of it.
INEZ: Gil -
GIL: I know it Inez - you can fool me but not Hemingway.
INEZ: Jesus Christ I'm dealing with a madman - okay - Paul and I had a few nights alone. We danced, we drank - you were always working - he's very attractive, he spoke to me in French - the whole mystique of this corny city got to me - it's over. We can put this all in perspective at home.
GIL: I'm not going back.
INEZ: I'm staying here. It's not the romantic fling. Paris is Paris. It's that I'm not in love with you.
GIL: I'm staying here. It's not the romantic fling. Paris is Paris. It's that I'm not in love with you.
INEZ: A lot has happened to me since we got here. I won't begin to bore you - but - I know what that feeling of love is and it's not us.
GIL: A lot has happened to me since we got here. I won't begin to bore you - but - I know what that feeling of love is and it's not us.
INEZ: Have you met someone else? All those late night walks.
GIL: I was attracted to another woman but it was the whole deal - meeting Gertrude Stein and Hemingway and Dali and Scott and Zelda -
INEZ: Honey, you better listen to yourself. You're a psycho. You don't know what you're doing. You see everything here through magical colored glasses. You're a California film writer with a house in Beverly Hills with two Mercedes'. You're not some kind of twenties expatriate novelist.
HELEN: What's going on? We can hear every If I'm not happy I'll move back. But right now I'm going to stay.
GIL: If I'm not happy I'll move back. But right now I'm going to stay.
INEZ: With who? All your crazy hallucinatory friends? Mother was right about you - there's a part
JOHN: said that first.
INEZ: Anyone who's protagonist makes a living selling old cap pistols and Joan Crawford cut out books.
GIL: You're better off without me.
INEZ: Go ahead. Walk the streets - gush over the Parisian light and the Goodbye Inez.
GIL: Goodbye Inez.
JOHN: I had a private detective follow him - I knew he was up to no good.
INEZ: Daddy you didn't.
JOHN: I did. He saw him get into a car at midnight each night and he followed close behind.
HELEN: What happened?
JOHN: I don't know. The detective agency says the detective is missing.
COUNT: A qui ai-je l'honneur?
TISSERANT: Je me suis perdu - J'ai pas du tourner au bon endroit
COUNTESS: Guardes! Guardes!
COUNT: Qu'on lui coupe la tete!

GIL: Hey, I know you - the girl at the flea market.
GABRIELLE: Oh yes - yes - the Cole Porter one.
GIL: What are you doing here?
GABRIELLE: I'm returning from dinner with my girlfriends. I live near here.
GIL: What's your name?
GABRIELLE: Gabrielle, - I'm Gil - I just moved to Paris this week.
GIL: Gabrielle, - I'm Gil - I just moved to Paris this week.
GABRIELLE: Oh I'm sure you'll love it.
GIL: Can I walk along with you or can I buy you a coffee? Oh god, it's starting to rain.
GABRIELLE: That's okay. I don't mind getting wet. Paris is the most beautiful in the rain.
GIL: Oh what a thing to say. I couldn't agree more.
GABRIELLE: I just thought about you the other day because my boss got in a whole album of Cole Porter songs.
GIL: Hey what are those bells?
GABRIELLE: It's midnight.
GIL: Midnight - right - right - pretty
