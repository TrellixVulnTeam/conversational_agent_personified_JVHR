CHARLIE: You spend too much time being "nice" to a girl, you'll wind up sittin' around listening to her complain about the son of a bitch she really loves.

CHARLIE: That's right. Sorry.
LISA: That's right. Sorry.
CHARLIE: Lisa, this may seem a little odd, but my friend over there and I were having this discusion and I thought maybe you could settle it for us.
LISA: I'll help out if I can.
CHARLIE: ( SHEEPISHLY ) Actually, I don't know. this is kind of a personal question.
LISA: That's okay. Go ahead.
CHARLIE: Alright. Just for the sake of argument, if I wasn't a happily married man. am I the kind of guy you'd go out with?
LISA: Oh, um. I don't know.

STANLEY: And where's that?
CHARLIE: The Monkey's Paw. Hottest new club in town. It's a guaranteed skirt alert and no dead beats So how are we gonna get in?

TINA: Excuse me, where can I open a new Charlie flashes his best 100 watt smile.
CHARLIE: You've come to the right place, ma'am. Just step right this way and pull up a chair.
TINA: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm a complete wreck. Will you hold this please?
CHARLIE: Here, let me take that for you.
TINA: But Tina turns and sits at Stanley's desk; Charlie is stunned at his near miss, but there's not a thing he can do about it.
STANLEY: So, uh, what kind of account did you have in mind?
TINA: ( smiles sweetly ) Well, I'm not sure exactly. I'm just terrible with things like that. That's an interesting tie Ipkiss. Stanley Ipkiss.
STANLEY: Ipkiss. Stanley Ipkiss.

TINA: That's it. It looks like. um. A young woman riding bareback. You know, like a Lady Godiva or Really? I don't think I can.

TINA: Or. if that's not a horse it could be two lovers. A man and a woman. That would be the woman on top, of course.

STANLEY: I don't know. .Bold colors. It's a power tie, y'know? They're supposed to make you feel. Does it work?

STANLEY: ( SOFTLY ) I hate this town. I really hate this town.
CHARLIE: Why are you getting out here?
STANLEY: I gotta pick up my car.
CHARLIE: Fine. Now don't forget. Ten o'clock at the Monkey's Paw. I've already got us lined up with a couple of authentic dimes.

IRV: Hang on. Hong on. Don't get your panties in a twist.
BURT: ( examining part ) Hey Irv, what the hell is this?

STANLEY: Doesn't it bother you that all the women you know are named after cartoon characters?
BARBIE: We've been waiting out here for hours. Can you get us in?
CHARLIE: No, problemo. Ladies, this is my pal Stanley Ipkiss. ( leans closer ) Stanley's very influential in the banking business.

RENO: G'night, doll.
DORIAN: That was a great performance, baby. But not as great as the one you pulled off at the bank.
TINA: Yeah, well don't get used to it. I'm not going to start running cons for you again, Dorian. I'm a singer now and that's it.
DORIAN: Oh, really? And you had such a red hot career before you latched on to me?
TINA: Who latched on to who?
DORIAN: Get real, Tina. You'll do what I say or I'll drop you back where I found you, slingin' hash and dodgin' horny peterbuilt drivers.
TINA: ( downs a shot ) Don't push me, Nicky. I might just take a walk I should have taken a long time ago.
DORIAN: ( CHUCKLES ) Easy, baby. Easy. ( to his men ) I love it when she gets pissed.
TINA: ( pulls her close ) That's right, baby. C'mere.
DORIAN: ( pulls her close ) That's right, baby. C'mere.
TINA: Sorry. I never get personal in front of the help.
DORIAN: That broad kills me.
DR. FREEZE: She just might, man. The bitch is trouble.
DORIAN: C'mon Doctor, lighten up. ( raises his glass ) Here's to Edge City Bank. May it crack like an egg on Easter Their glasses CLINK.

DEATH'S HEAD: A cop chauffeur? I never seen that before. How about you boys?

THE: Manager's door flies open and MRS. PEENMAN appears. She's an old dragon in hair curlers who will probably live forever just to spite her MRS. PEENMAN Ipkiss! Do you have any idea what time it is?
MRS. PEENMAN: Ipkiss! Do you have any idea what time it is?
STANLEY: Actually, no.
MRS. PEENMAN: It's three o'clock in the morning! First, you wake up the entire building laughing it up with your pals. Then, you come in and start squeak - ( sees puddles ) My new carpet! Just look at that! This is coming out of your cleaning deposit Ipkiss!
STANLEY: ( SOFTLY ) Are you done?
MRS. PEENMAN: I think I'll be going to bed now.
STANLEY: I think I'll be going to bed now.
STANLEY: Hello, Milo.
THE BEDROOM: Stanley's prized collection of "golden Age" Looney Tunes tapes are neatly displayed on a simple bookshelf.
MILO: enters, holding a Frisbee in his mouth.
STANLEY: Easy. This is the best part.
DR. NEUMAN: That's correct. The truth is we all wear masks, metaphorically speaking. We repress the Id. our darkest desires and hide behind a more socially acceptable image of ourselves in order to cope with the frustrations of our day to day lives.
STANLEY: Think I'm repressed, Milo?
LARRY KING: The book is "The Masks We Wear," by Dr. Arthur Neuman. Thank you Dr. Neuman.
STANLEY: No thank you, Dr. Neuman.
SUBTLE: SHIMMER crosses its surface. Milo WHIMPERS and quickly hops off the bed.
STANLEY: A HAND reaches out of the twister and locks onto the bedpost. The whirlwind SCREECHES to a halt, causing sparks and smoke to rise
FROM: the singed carpet. The smoke clears revealing.
THE MASK: He SNAPS his bow tie with a crazy gleam in his eyes.
MASK: Easy lady! I was just killin' The Mask starts ricocheting off the walls HOOTING maniacal laughter as Mrs. Peenman lets loose with both barrels. KA-BOOM.

MASK: And for my next trick.
AN: elaborate balloon sculpture. SQUEAK. SQUEAK. SCREECH.
IRV: Now these are serious chili dogs.
BURT: I know. Here's the proof. ( lets out a long BUUURP ) Aaah. Even tastier the second time around.
IRV: Hey Burt, pull on my finger.
BURT: No way, man.
IRV: No, really. Go ahead.
BURT: Irv, don't.
IRV: ( PROUDLY ) That, my friend is the sweet smell of success.
BURT: ( SHRUGS ) No style. I give it a five tops.
IRV: Okay, how about. Soprano.
BURT: Fine muscle control.
IRV: And now for my grand finale, THX. The audience is listening!
IRV: Hey, 40 watt. we're closed! Nobody's here.
MASK: Ah. but you're here.
IRV: What I mean is.
IRV: Nobody's here that wants to help you.
MASK: But I'm here to help you.
FWEEP!: Stanley/Mask whirls about with a flourish and pulls two gleaming mufflers from the wall.
MASK: Sounds like you have a little exhaust problem there!
JUMPS: out of bed with a start.
STANLEY: A dream. It was only a dream.
LT. KELLAWAY: Nice PJ's pal.
STANLEY: Can I help you?
LT. KELLAWAY: You're Ipkiss? Stanley Ipkiss?
STANLEY: That's right.
LT. KELLAWAY: Some kind of prowler broke in and attacked Mrs. Peenman.
STANLEY: ( swallows hard ) Really? I didn't hear a thing.
LT. KELLAWAY: Then you must be a pretty sound sleeper, Ipkiss 'cause she unloaded a couple rounds of 20 ott buckshot five feet from your Kellaway swings Stanley's door open wider to give him a better view of the damage. Mrs. Peenman stands there in the hall tearfully speaking to anither OFFICER.
QUICK CUTS: C.U. - The shotgun blasts in the walls.
STANLEY: ( GASPS ) That's. impossible!
LT. KELLAWAY: Excuse me?
STANLEY: That's. a, possible. See, I have this inner ear problem. ( wiggles a finger in his ear vigorously ) Sometimes I can't hear a thing.
KELLAWAY: ( SKEPTICAL ) Is that a fact?
STANLEY: Kellaway leans closer to speak more loudly, but catches himself and shoots Stanley a dirty look.
KELLAWAY: Forget it.
STANLEY: Sure. thanks.
KELLAWAY: Look, Mrs. Peenman, you gotta admit your description is pretty tough to swallow.
MRS. PEENMAN: Then you can choke on it for all I care. I saw what I saw.
KELLAWAY: ( refers to notes ) A green head the size of a pumpkin, purple zoot suit and spats. That's a pretty serious fashion risk for any self-respecting second story man.
OFFICER: Lt., we just got an emergency call from a mechanic on 67th Street.
KELLAWAY: Some kind of assault and battery. Sound pretty bad.
POLICEMAN: Some kind of assault and battery. Sound pretty bad.
KELLAWAY: ( SIGHS ) Alright. Dont' worry Mrs. Peenman, we'll find this guy for you. Officer Deluca here has a few forms you'll have to fill out.
STANLEY: Milo! Keys! Keys!
STANLEY: Good boy.
PARAMEDIC #3: I want a proctologist standing by! Yeah, you heard me! The best one you can find.
OFFICER: We were able to get a description Lt., but it's pretty weird.
KELLAWAY: ( SIGHS ) Let me guess. Big green head. Zoot suit.
OFFICER: How did you.
KELLWAY: Whoever this guy is, he's a world class twisto.
PEGGY: Excuse me, Lt., I'm with the Evening Star. Can you tell me what happened here?
KELLAWAY: Sorry. Too early to comment.
PEGGY: It looks like some kind of mob scare tactic.
KELLAWAY: I said no comment. Now break it up. This is a crime scene.
SIFTING: through some papers scattered all over the floor. Nothing.
CHARLIE: What happened to you last night? The girls and I were looking all over for you.
STANLEY: I uh, didn't feel so good. I decided to go home early.
CHARLIE: As a matter of fact, you don't look so good. You got to take better care of yourself, man.
STANLEY: How was the club?
CHARLIE: Are you kidding? It was hotter than a pistol. Did you see the Your girlfriend got a great Chralie flips open the Entertainment section of the Evening Star. There's a great close-up of Tina singing her heart out with the

HEADLINE: "Bombshell Explodes at Monnkey's Paw."
DICKEY: Ipkiss! You're forty minutes late! Every time you do that you're robbing this bank of its time and money!
STANLEY: Sorry, Mr. Dicky. It won't happen again.
DICKEY: ( snatches newspaper ) If you weren't so busy ogling girlie pictures you'd get some work done around here.
CHARLIE: Ah. She's a prospective client of Stanley's, sir.
DICKEY: ( sudden attitude change ) She is? Well. Next time she comes in see that you send her directly to my office.
STANLEY: Yes sir, Mr. Dickey.
CHARLIE: Look at that little creep. If it wasn't for his daddy he'd be out somewhere shakin' down school kids for lunch money.
STANLEY: You think she ever will come back, Who knows? Forget about her, Stanley. A dame like that is always looking for the B.B.D. The bigger better deal. Ask her what her sign is and she'll say You don't know that. She's an artist. Maybe she's sensitive.
CHARLIE: Who knows? Forget about her, Stanley. A dame like that is always looking for the B.B.D. The bigger better deal. Ask her what her sign is and she'll say You don't know that. She's an artist. Maybe she's sensitive.
STANLEY: You don't know that. She's an artist. Maybe she's sensitive.
CHARLIE: Yeah. She can sense a guy's credit line at two hundred yards. Stanley, you need a girl you can depend on. Someone a little more down to earth. someone like.
PEGGY: Excuse me, can you tell me where I can find Stanley Ipkiss?
CHARLIE: Like her! Someone like her. ( straightens tie ) As a matter of fact I could use someone like her myself. ( rises as Peggy approaches ) Hel-lo there. May I be of some Stanley Ipkiss?
PEGGY: Stanley Ipkiss?
STANLEY: Oh, hi. I already have a subscription, thanks.
PEGGY: Oh no, actually I just wanted to ask you a few questions.
STANLEY: Really? About what?
PEGGY: Ripley Auto Finishing. You're a customer of theirs aren't you?
STANLEY: I. uh. No. I think you must have made a mistake.
PEGGY: Isn't this a form of theirs you filled out?
STANLEY: ( nervous chuckle ) Oh, that Ripley Auto. I guess I have stopped in there once or twice, Miss. what did you say your name was?
PEGGY: Peggy Brandt.
STANLEY: Wait a minute. Peggy Brandt of "Ask Peggy"?
PEGGY: That's right.
STANLEY: ( brightens up ) You printed my letter last year, remember? "Nice Guys Finish You're Mr. Nice Guy? Stanley do you realize how much mail we got about that letter? There's hundreds of women out there who are looking for a man just like Are you serious?
PEGGY: You're Mr. Nice Guy? Stanley do you realize how much mail we got about that letter? There's hundreds of women out there who are looking for a man just like Are you serious?
STANLEY: Are you serious?
PEGGY: Of course. DO you know how hard it is to find a decent man in this town? Most of them think monogamy is some kind of wood.
STANLEY: Why are you covering this story?
PEGGY: They cut my salary. I just can't make it by on "Dear Peggy" anymore. The truth is, I want to be a real reporter and if I can break this story I know they'll let me. ( sits closer ) Look Stanley, I know Ripley Auto is a crooked operation. They may even have had ties to the Mob. I'm not out to get you. I just want the truth.
STANLEY: I wish I knew the truth, Peggy. I really do.
DISAPPEARS: INT. DORIAN'S OFFICE Sweet Eddy escorts him inside. The man removes his glasses and glances about nervously. Dorian sits at his desk. Dr. Freeze and Chun Woo are going over an array of high tech burglary equipment laid out on the air hockey table.
DORIAN: Good afternoon, Councilman Snell. Nice of you to drop by.
SNELL: Cut the crap. Dorian. What's so important that I had to come here in person?
DORIAN: I got a little job for you, Tom. I want you to pull the Swede's gambling license.
SNELL: That's impossible. He was approved six months ago.
DORIAN: Pull a few strings. Find something in the fine print. I don't care how you do it, but do it. You owe me.
SNELL: ( CHUCKLES ) I owe you nothing, you little piece of shit. I got your liquor license when nobody else would touch.
DORIAN: ( SOFTLY ) That's pretty. What is that, a Snell nods. Dorian takes a deep whiff.
SNELL: ( GASPING ) No. please. I can do it. I can make it happen.
DORIAN: That's smart. You're a very smart man. Now pull yourself together. Look at you.
TINA: Or it could be two lovers. That would be the woman on top, of course.
CHARLIE: Forget her, Stanley. Ask her what her sign is and she'll say dollar.
DICKEY: Every time you're late Ipkiss, you're robbing this bank!
DR. NEUMAN: We must repress our Id. our deepest darkest desires.
TINA: Hey, are you okay.
STANLEY: I am now. C'mere, baby.
TINA: ( SWOONS ) Oh, Stanley!
STANLEY: Stanley suddenly realizes Milo is licking his ear. and he's just woken up.
THE MASK: Through his bedroom window, propped up on the fourth story ledge. Its leering grin seems to beckon Stanley as we begin to hear the POUNDING beat of the Mask F.X. theme.
STANLEY: stands transfixed, staring at the moonlit face. He can almost hear echos of faint whispered VOICES calling his name. A deadly siren song above the pounding drums.
STANLEY: ( SOFTLY ) He backs away from the window.
STANLEY: takes a last look at the crumpled picture of Tina in his hand and finally loses control. He bolts from the room.
THE LEDGE: Stanley wavers precariously on the crumbling masonry, then catches his balance. His face is bathed in sweat as he gazes at the leering face. F.X. music THUNDERS in his head.
THE MASK: ( faint echos ) Stanley. Stanley.
STANLEY: Just. one. last. time.
MILO: watches from the apratment window, whimpering softly.
STANLEY: carefully reaches down, his fingers just brushing the mask as he teeters out over nothingness. Night traffic whizzes by down THE MASONRY cracks away.
THE MASONRY: cracks away.
STANLEY: SCREAMS as he begins to fall, jamming the mask to his face.
MASK: ( SINGS ) I gotta be me! I just gotta be me!
MASK: ( a'la Big Bopper ) Oooooh Bay-bee. I knoooooows what you likah!

DECOR: complete with live exotic birds in huge indoor Banyon trees. WAITRESSES in leopard skin leotards make their way across the crowded dance floor with trays full of oversized tropical drinks.
TINA CARLYLE: in a glittering gown that's made of little more than sequins and mesh. If there were such a thing as fashion police this dress would be arrested for disturbing the peace.
TINA: There's all kinds of men In this old world That seek the affections Of a beautiful girl.
ANOTHER ANGLE: The Mask is seated at a table on the other side of the club and immediately reacts when he lays eyes on Tina.
EACH: beat. Customers at nearby tables are astonished.
DORIAN'S TABLE: Sweet Eddy looks nervous as hell as he appears beside Dorian.
DORIAN: What the hell are you doing here?

THE MASK: CUT TO: INT. DORIAN'S OFFICE Dorian and Sweet Eddy enter to find Dr. Freeze, sitting there, gasping in pain with a bar towel pressed against a bloody wound in his side.
DORIAN: What the hell happened to you?
FREEZE: I'll be okay. Nobody puts the chill on Freeze.

DORIAN: Clear the club. Now!
DANCE FLOOR: The dance's grand finale. The Mask spins Tina around and around his body like a baton in one of those awful Hawaiian fire dances.
DORIAN: stands at the edge of the dance floor, his smoking gun trained on the Mask.
THE MASK: ( gasps in mock horror ) Gee willickers! Does this mean we won't make the Star Search This means you won't make it out of this club alive if you don't tell me where my money is.
DORIAN: This means you won't make it out of this club alive if you don't tell me where my money is.

MASK: Ak. you got me Pahdnuh. ( cough. cough )
THEIR: guns drawn.
KELLAWAY: Drop it, Tyrel!
DORIAN: Hello, Kellaway. You got a warrant or did you just drop by for a night cap?
KELLAWAY: I got probable cause. A couple of your boys were spotted knocking over Edge City Bank.
DORIAN: Easy, junior. You're givin' me a woodey.
KELLWAY: One of them was wearin' some kind of big green mask.
DORIAN: For once you're on the right track, but that's not one of my men. Maybe you ought to try a little actual police work instead of this harassment bullshit.
KELLAWAY: This isn't harassment. You want to see some harassment? ( to his men ) Search the place, boys.
DORIAN: Ever wonder why you didn't make Captain, asshole? I got friends so high up they'd give you a nose Kellaway hauls off and CRACKS him in the face with a solid right Well what d'ya know? I guess they gave you one too.
KELLAWAY: Well what d'ya know? I guess they gave you one too.
DORIAN: ( SOFTLY ) You're a dead man.
OFFICER: Lt., we got a stiff upstairs. One of the guys from the heist.
KELLAWAY: ( cuffs him ) Better call that high-priced lawyer of yours, Tyrel. You're comin' downtown.
DORIAN: I'll be back on the streets before sunrise and you know it.
KELLAWAY: Then just think of this as the city's way of showing you a little ( pats him on the cheek ) I'll stop by to tuck you in As the police drag Dorian outside, Kellaway notices someting on the dance floor.
CLOSER: Kellaway picks up the slice of pajama fabric that was once the Mask's tie and inspects it closely. It's the same fabric Kellaway saw Stalney wearing that morning.
KELLAWAY: You're on your own, boys.
COP: Don't worry, Lt. If he's in there, well get him.
KELLAWAY: And if he's not, I got a feeling I know where to find him.
STANLEY: Oh my god!
STANLEY: All right, I'm coming!
STANLEY: Lieutenant, what a surprise! What can I do for you?
LT. KELLAWAY: You can answer a few questions.
STANLEY: I've got to get ready for work.
LT. KELLAWAY: Trust me. Your bank's opening late today.
STANLEY: Here. mostly. Is something LT. KELLAWAY Maybe, yes. Maybe, no. Maybe it's all just a crazy coincidence that this so called "Mask" character always seems to be wherever you are.
LT. KELLAWAY: Maybe, yes. Maybe, no. Maybe it's all just a crazy coincidence that this so called "Mask" character always seems to be wherever you are.
STANLEY: Mask who?
LT. KELLAWAY: Don't insult my intelligence, Ipkiss. First, he's spotted in your building, then the bank where you work and now I find this at the Monkey's Paw.
STANLEY: Milo. No! ( moves the dog away ) Okay, so I went out on the town last night. A guy's got to have a little fun.
LT. KELLAWAY: In your jammies?
STANLEY: Naw, I just took 'em with me in case I didn't make it home. I don't know about you, Lieutenant. But I've got a pretty good track record with the ladies.
LT. KELLAWAY: Wait a second. you smell that?
STANLEY: ( SNIFFS ) Bullshit. I hate the smell of bullshit. Don't even think about leaving town, Ipkiss. I'll be in touch.
KELLAWAY: ( SNIFFS ) Bullshit. I hate the smell of bullshit. Don't even think about leaving town, Ipkiss. I'll be in touch.
STANLEY: What are we gonna do, Milo? What are we gonna do?
WIDER: Kellaway sips a cup of brackish coffee as Oliveras FREEZE-FRAMES the best image of the Mask. There's a wild-eyed look of glee on his face as he stuffs sacks full of money.
DEPUTY OLIVERAS: I don't know, boss. That's one helluva rubber mask.
LT. KELLAWAY: Where's the lab report?
DEPUTY OLIVERAS: We got fingerprints on some of the currency, but nothing matches Tyrel's men. Looks like this guy beat 'em to the punch.
LT. KELLAWAY: Get the bank's employee files and run down the prints on a guy named DEPUTY OLIVERAS You figure it was an inside job?
DEPUTY OLIVERAS: You figure it was an inside job?
LT. KELLAWAY: Yeah, and all I need is a couple of prints to lock this wack job up 'till doomsday.
DORIAN: A fifty thousand dollar reward to the man who finds this "Mask" character before the cops do. Get the word out to every street hustler and low life in this town. ( pounds his fist ) I want him here. In my office. Alive. By tomorrow! Now get Everybody scrambles out of their seats.
DORIAN: What are you looking at?
TINA: You. You're losing it Dorian.
DORIAN: I'm losing nothing. Except maybe some extra baggage I don't need around here.
TINA: What's that supposed to mean?
DORIAN: You weren't putting up much of a fight when that green goon kissed you last night.
TINA: C'mon, did it look to you like I had a choice?
DORIAN: Maybe you did and maybe you didn't, but I know this, one day real soon I'm gonna run this town and when I do there's gonna be payback for anyone who crossed ( glares at her ) I mean anyone.
MR. DICKEY: Ipkiss! We have a crisis on our hands here and you stroll in over an hour late. If I have to put up with your slovenly.
STANLEY: ( EXPLODES ) Back off Monkey-Boy, before I tell your daddy how you're running this branch like it's your own personal piggy bank! If the I.R.S. saw some of those files we could arrange a little vacation for you at Club Fed!
MR. DICKEY: That will be all, Ipkiss.
CHARLIE: Woah! What side of who's bed did you wake up on?
STANLEY: I'm not sure.
CHARLIE: ( WARILY ) Yeah, well you look like you could use a little R and R there buddy. and as a matter of fact I've got just the ticket. Or should I say tickets?
STANLEY: I'm afraid to ask.
CHARLIE: Saturday night. Grand opening of the Valhalla Casino. Serious skirt alert. Everybody who's anybody will be there. What do you say?
STANELY: I don't know Charlie, I.
STANLEY: Tina. What are you doing here?
TINA: I heard about the robbery. I guess I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
STANLEY: Oh, don't worry about me.
TINA: Are you sure? You look a I'm just having a little trouble sleeping is all.
STANLEY: I'm just having a little trouble sleeping is all.
TINA: I'm not so sure I'll have much to open an account with anymore.
STANLEY: What about the nightclub? I thought you were doing great.
TINA: I don't know how much longer I can stay there Stanley. Things are getting a little intense.
STANLEY: Well, there must be plenty of other places you could sing. Maybe even get a record deal.
TINA: I wish it was that easy. There's thousands of girls out there just like me who.
STANLEY: Not just like you. You've got a voice like. like an angel.
TINA: ( lights a cigarette ) An angel huh? That's the first time I've heard that one.
STANLEY: No, I mean it. You really do.
TINA: I can vamp my way through a tune. But that's not really singing.
STANLEY: What is it with you, Tina? Why don't you believe in yourself?
TINA: ( SIGHS ) I guess I've just heard a lot of promises from a lot of guys. In the end they all wanted the same thing and it wasn't a song.
STANLEY: So maybe you've been singing for the wrong guys.
TINA: I'm not so sure there's any other kind. Not for me, anyway.
STANLEY: What about this guy, the Mask? Do the cops have a line on him?
TINA: What about this guy, the Mask? Do the cops have a line on him?
STANLEY: I'm not sure. Why are you Promise you won't say anything?
TINA: Promise you won't say anything?
STANLEY: He came to the club last night and he was just so. well, different. I haven't been able to get him off my mind.
TINA: He came to the club last night and he was just so. well, different. I haven't been able to get him off my mind.
STANLEY: Really? They say he's pretty weird looking.
TINA: Yeah. He's ugly. but he's kinda cool. y'know, like Mick Jagger.
STANLEY: You really think so?
TINA: Yeah. If you hear anything about him, would you call me at the Stanley nods - unsure of what to say. Tina opens the door, but before she exits.
STANLEY: Actually. I sort of know the The Mask. We're - old college buddies him and I.
TINA: The Mask. We're - old college buddies him and I.
STANLEY: The Mask. We're - old college buddies him and I.
TINA: Are you serious?
STANLEY: Oh yeah. To tell you the truth, I'm sorta covering for him on this bank thing. He's not such a bad guy, really. He just gets a little carried away.
TINA: I'll say. Do you think you could give him a message?
STANLEY: I suppose so.
TINA: Tell him I want to see him again
STANLEY: When? I mean, I'd need to tell him exactly.
TINA: How about seven o'clock tonight at Peninsula Park.

LANDLORD: I've heard that one before.
PEGGY: C'mon, at least let me get a few of my things.
LANDLORD: Don't make me regret this. We get a certified check by noon tomorrow or a Sheriff will escort you out of here.
PEGGY: Thanks Phil. You're a sweetheart.
THE FIGURE: stands in the shadows by the fire escape. He's got a voice that sounds like he's been gargling glass.
THE FIGURE: I heard you were lookin' for a Who. Who are you?
PEGGY: Who. Who are you?
THE FIGURE: Just a guy with a little information lookin' to make a buck. But maybe I heard wrong. You don't look like much of a reporter to me.
PEGGY: You give me something worth printing and I'll get you your money. What's this about?

DORIAN: Is that right?
SWEDE: Here. have a little something to eat. That's Svenska meatballs, kid. The real thing.
DORIAN: Dorian starts to eat.
SWEDE: So, I tell you Dorian, it's a terrible shame. I put all my hard work into this beautiful casino and what do you think? All the sudden I got all kinda problems with the city. Big problems. The whole deal could fold.
DORIAN: Maybe I can help you out. I'm expecting to come into a little investment capital shortly. If worse comes to worse and you really need to bail out.
SWEDE: What a sweet guy. Isn't this guy a sweetheart? Thanks for the offer Dorian, but I think maybe I can solve this myself.
DORIAN: Is that right?
SWEDE: That's right. You know that Councilman you got in your pocket?
DORIAN: Sure, Swede. Take it easy.

SAME: man we saw interviewed on "The Larry King Show." The byline reads "The Mysterious Powers of the Identities Within Us."
WIDER: Stanley paces the plush office like a caged animal while Dr. Neuman sits nearby toying with his pipe.
DR. NEUMAN: This is extremely unusual, Mr. Ipkiss. Barging in without an appointment or.
STANLEY: Look, you're the big expert on masks, right? Well, I've got an emergency here! ( his face TWITCHES )
DR. NEUMAN: Try to calm yourself. Now this woman you were telling me about, I'm not sure I understand the I've got a date with the girl of my dreams, only she doesn't know it's me.

DR. NEUMAN: So you believe this actually changes you into a different ( face twitches ) It's turning me into some kind of lunatic! ( briefly CONTORTS into a Mask expression )
STANLEY: ( face twitches ) It's turning me into some kind of lunatic! ( briefly CONTORTS into a Mask expression )
DR. NEUMAN: Mr. Ipkiss, please. This is just obsessional dellusion. What you have here is nothing more than a piece of wood.
STANELY: But your book says masks.
DR. NEUMAN: My book uses masks as a metaphor for our complex personalities. The masks we must present to the outside world. to suppress the id. To protect our innermost Yeah, well this one works in DR. NEUMAN You're going to have to be willing to work on this delusion or.

STANLEY: It's not a delusion! Alright, I'll prove it to you if I have to, but I won't be responsible for the consequences.
DR. NEUMAN: Mr. Ipkiss please! There is no such thing as a magical mask.
STANLEY: ( holds up mask ) Last chance to hide all dangerous DR. NEUMAN Alright then, go on. You're not going to frighten me.
DR. NEUMAN: Alright then, go on. You're not going to frighten me.
STANLEY: He starts spinning around.
DR. NEUMAN: Whoa, what?
STANLEY: It didn't work?
DR. NEUMAN: Does that surprise you? The mask is nothing but a reflection of you - the inner you.
STANLEY: It worked last night. And the night before. Maybe it only works at night. What kind of mask did you say this was.
DR. NEUMAN: Scandinavian. It looks like a representation of Loki, the Norse God of Mischief. He supposedly caused so much trouble that Odin banished him from Valhalla ( GASPS ) What if he banished him. into a mask?
STANLEY: ( GASPS ) What if he banished him. into a mask?
DR. NEUMAN: ( SIGHS ) I'm sorry, Mr. Ipkiss, we're out of time.

LT. KELLAWAY: fires up his engine and pulls away.
TINA: Stanley, what are you doing here?
STANLEY: Oh, Tina. Hi. You're early.
TINA: A little.
STANLEY: I just. wanted to make sure you two got together okay.
TINA: That's nice. ( sits down ) You know, I hardly ever stop by here. It's hard to believe it was just a garbage heap.
STANLEY: ( looking at the sky ) It's always beautiful at sunset. Those methane emissions really pick up the colors.
TINA: Wow. They really do. All those pinks and greens.
STANLEY: Well. I'm sure my cousin will be along any minute. He never shows up anywhere 'till after sundown. He's sort of strange that way.
TINA: No, Stanley. Stay for a second. I was thinking about what you said and I, uh, I want you to know I appreciate it. Maybe you're right. If I believed in myself a little more I wouldn't rely on guys like Dorian.
STANLEY: Dorian. You mean Dorian Tyrel?
TINA: Yeah. He's sort of my manager.
STANLEY: Tina, you've got to be careful of that guy. He's a dangerous You really mean that, don't you?

STANLEY: C'mon, Tina this is serious. How involved are you with this guy?
TINA: I can take care of myself, Stanley. I always have.
STANLEY: Oh, really? People close to Tyrel have a nasty habit of turning up dead, or haven't you noticed?
TINA: Look, this may sound a little cold but I do what I have to do to get by, okay? I'm nobody in this town without Dorian.
STANLEY: And who are you with him Tina? I'm not exactly sure who I am anymore but at least I'm trying to find out. If you really had any faith in yourself, you wouldn't be hanging on to some kind of free ride.
TINA: ( RISES ) Stanley. wait!

STANLEY: Go find yourself a new home, Milo. It looks like I'm going to be here for a long long time.
GUARD: Wake up. You gotta visitor.
STANLEY: About time you found me a ( a beat ) Hello, Stanley.
TINA: Hello, Stanley.
STANLEY: What's wrong? Your boyfriend kick you out for not delivering me on Is that what you think - that I set you up?
TINA: Is that what you think - that I set you up?
STANLEY: I don't know. But I've got plenty of time to figure it out.
TINA: You're just going to have to trust me on this.
STANLEY: Now is not the best time for me on trusting women.
TINA: I ran out on Dorian last night, Stanley. I just came to tell you I'm sorry. Sorry about You ran out on him?
STANLEY: You ran out on him?
TINA: That magic mask of yours turned him into some kind of monster.
STANLEY: He wasn't exactly Mother Theresa in the first place.
TINA: He's going to the casino opening tonight and he's planning to do something terrible.
STANLEY: A real change of pace for him.
TINA: Half this town will be there Stanley. I tried to tell the cops, but they wouldn't listen to me.
STANLEY: As long as he's got the mask, there's nothing they can do to stop him anyway. There's nothing anyone can do.
TINA: There must be some way. How does it work?
STANLEY: ( PAUSES ) It's like it brings you innermost desires to life. If deep down inside you're a little repressed and. a hopeless romantic, you become sort of a love-crazy wild And if you've got a black heart?
TINA: And if you've got a black heart?
STANLEY: Then the world's going to be a very dark place. And if I were you, I'd get out of town. Fast.
TINA: For what?
STANLEY: For what?
TINA: Lots of things. For really believing in me when I couldn't. For sharing a sunset with me. For being the first guy to treat me like I was a person instead of a slab of meat. ( a beat ) And for being any kind of romantic. Even a hopeless one.
STANLEY: ( SOFTENING ) You're welcome.
TINA: You know, that night at the club I knew I met someone special. Someone like nobody I'd ever met The Mask.
STANLEY: The Mask.
TINA: No. the guy that was inside the Mask all the time. You. Stanley Ip -
TINA: I've got to disappear for awhile Stanley. I'm not sure where I'll go but I'll let you know as soon as I can.
STANLEY: ( to the Key-Guard ) Hey! A girl's being kidnapped out there! Do something!
DORIAN: ( SARCASTICALLY ) Baby, there you are. ( he embraces her ) I was gettin' all worried about I just went out for a little while Sweet Eddy holds up a small suitcase and an overstuffed shoulder bag he got from her car.
TINA: I just went out for a little while Sweet Eddy holds up a small suitcase and an overstuffed shoulder bag he got from her car.
DORIAN: Looks like maybe a long little while, right baby?
DORIAN: You know what happened to the last bitch that ran out on me? Do ( CHOKING ) Nobody else does either. Nobody ever will.
TINA: ( CHOKING ) Nobody else does either. Nobody ever will.
DORIAN: Nobody else does either. Nobody ever will.

STANLEY: ( stage whisper ) EXT. THE ALLEY - SAME TIME Just a pile of trash. The dog's gone. Then. a RUSTLE. A filthy blanket moves. and MILO emerges from it - tail waggling as he sees Stanley.
STANLEY: Come on, boy!
STANLEY: shows Milo the guard, then whispers in the dog's ear.
STANLEY: Keys, Milo. Get the keys!
STANLEY: Good boy.
FOLLOWING MILO: He approaches the guard and stops - staring at the keys dangling from the man's mouth. Milo jumps up on the desk and bites down on
THE: key-chain. He starts to pull when.
STANLEY: Atta boy, Milo. Now let's see if we can get out of here.

THE SWEDE: So, ladies and gentlemen with a special thanks to Mayor Tilton and everyone else who made this possible, I give you. the Valhalla Casino.
DORIAN: It's almost time.
WIDER: Gun in hand, Stanley silently backs away with Milo at his side.
STANLEY: puts one hand over his eyes and slams the butt of the gun down as hard as he can on the Guard's head. THONK. The Guard drops back
DOWN: on his chair unconscious.
STANLEY: Come on.
KELLAWAY: Stanley is shocked, but quickly realizes he's got the gun. He points it at Kellaway with greater authority.
STANLEY: Hold it! I warn you! I'm seriously stressed out here!
KELLAWAY: Easy, Ipkiss. Don't be an idiot. You're in the middle of a police station. There's no way you're just going to walk out of here.
STANLEY: ( PAUSES ) You're right.
KELLAWAY: Now what are you doing?
STANLEY: Putting myself in your custody.
KELLAWAY: You are certifiable.
STANLEY: Milo immediately jumps inside and Stanley buttons up. He now looks like he has a pretty nasty pot belly, but otherwise okay.
KELLAWAY: Of course. We wouldn't want to keep Alice and the white rabbit Keeping the gun jammed in Kellaway's ribs, Stanley folds his jacket over his gun hand. We hear it cock beneath the jacket. KA-
STANLEY: Now move.

CASINO The frightened crowd mills about in terror as Dorian's thugs seal off the exits. They frisk down their captives for loot and jewelry. Orlando runs up to Dorian/Mask with canvas sacks filled with money.
ORLANDO: We scored over half a mil from the safe!
TINA: Let me go you bastard!
SWEET EDDY: All set boss.
STANLEY: Okay. When I push the red button the safety is off, right?
KELLAWAY: I'm not helping you, Ipkiss.
STANLEY: Alright, suit yourself. ( to Milo ) You stay and be a good boy.
TILTON: Hey, watch it! Oh, Arnie.
THUG: Suddenly Stanley pops up from behind the overturned barrel with a huge frying pan and slams it right into camera. CLANG.
STANLEY: plucks the gun from the unconscious Guard and sneaks into the INT. CASINO Stanley appears out of the kitchen doors and gets the attention of the nearest captive party-goers.
STANLEY: Pssst. You guys. Over here.
CHARLIE: Stanley! What are you doing here?
STANLEY: Start sneaking people out the back. Watch out for the oil.

TINA: Hang on, Tina.
STANLEY: Hang on, Tina.
TINA: Stanley, look out!
TINA: You've got it all wrong! I could care less about this creep. Nobody could replace you, Dorian. If you think a line like that's going to save your life, you're dumber than he is.
TINA: ( SOFTLY ) Okay. Maybe it's too late. Then all I want is. a kiss.
TINA: One last kiss.
TINA: No! From the real Dorian. The guy I used to love.
ORLANDO: No time, boss. This building's going down any minute.
DORIAN: .to give the girl one last He plants his mouth on Tina's kissing her roughly. Tina really gets into it. But Stanley watches as Tina slyly positions the leg that he freed up. And.
REAL TIME: The dog lands back on the ground the mask firmly in his mouth. He starts to run away but. Dorian grabs his hind leg.
DORIAN: C'mere, you ugly little mutt.
MILO: legs pumping frantically, is losing ground. At the last second, he drops the mask and jams his muzzle into it. Lightning FLASHES.
DORIAN'S: eyes widen as
BIG: Sweet Eddy up and shakes him back and forth, like a rag doll.
STANLEY: watches this, then takes a look at the TICKING DETONATOR. Less than a minute to go. He strains at his bonds forcing the rope into a
SWEET EDDY: Get him off me!
ORLANDO: C'mon! We've got the money. Let's get the hell out of here!
DORIAN: I gotta have that mask!
STANLEY: burns through his ropes. He frees himself and races to the detonator. 15 - 14 - 13 - 12
VIKING SHIP: Stanley yanks one wire after another, but the timer still ticks down 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 Stanley pulls the last wire. The timer stops. Tina exhales, relieved, as Stanley unties her.
TINA: ( kissing him ) You did it.
STANLEY: Milo! Milo, come!
DORIAN: SCREAMS as the boat slides right over him.
TINA: Stanley. we made it. We're Milo lets loose a happy "Whoof!" and leaps into Stanley's arms. Stanley removes the mask with a SCHWOOP and Milo transforms back into a regular dog.
DORIAN: I'll take that.
STANLEY: Hold it right there or you'll be looking for this on the bottom of the harbor.
DORIAN: Drop it and I'll kill you all.
STANLEY: You can have it. But she gets to go.

TINA: ( sees fire ) Stanley! The dynamite!
TINA: Beat. Stanley surfaces gasping for breath. Tina pulls him over to the barrel and Milo licks his face.
STANLEY: Back to jail, Lieutenant?
LT. KELLAWAY: Ipkiss, I'd like to lock you up for the rest of my life. But the mayor and a hundred other witnesses say Dorian Tyrel's the bad guy and you're the good guy. So no jail. Just a downtown parade at noon.
CHARLIE SCHUMACHER: standing near the crowd of post-party VICTIMS being helped by the POLICE and MEDICAL PERSONNEL. He's still hitting on that
STATUESQUE: Valkyrie change girl.
CHARLIE: So I deck this thug, grab his gun and tell Stanley, "Take cover, Buddy. I'll get these folks out sae and sound."
