ANDY: But I've got a sports show. Championship wrestling, at five.
STANLEY: ( he blows his top ) You know that's not what I meant! Look, I'm gonna put my foot down! No more playing alone. You wanna perform, you GOTTA have an audience!
ANDY: ( he points at the wall ) B-but I have them.

MANAGER: The comedy stylings of Andy Kaufman, Ladies and Gentlemen! In the b.g., Andy starts packing up his props: Hand puppets, conga drums, a phonograph. it all goes into a big bulky INT. NY NIGHTCLUB - 1975 - LATER THAT NIGHT The club is empty. At the bar, the manager cleans up. Andy eagerly comes over. Offstage, his presence is soft, placid his voice barely above a whisper.
ANDY: So, Mr. Besserman, same slot Eh, I dunno. Andy. I'm. thinkin' of letting you go.
MANAGER: ( awkward ) Eh, I dunno. Andy. I'm. thinkin' of letting you go.
ANDY: You're firing me?? You don't even pay me!
MANAGER: Look I don't wanna seem insulting. But. your act is like amateur hour: Singalongs. puppets. playing records. A stunned beat. Andy is hurt.
ANDY: What do you want? "Take my wife, Sure! Comedy! Make jokes about the traffic. Do impressions. Maybe a little blue material.
MANAGER: Sure! Comedy! Make jokes about the traffic. Do impressions. Maybe a little blue material.
ANDY: I don't swear. I I don't do what everyone else does!
MANAGER: Well, everyone else gets this place cookin'! Pal, it's hard for me to move the booze when you're singin' "Pop Goes The Weasel." Andy stares, disheartened. I'm sorry. You're finished here. An uncomfortable beat and then Andy starts crying. The manager is dumbfounded. He doesn't know what to do. Tears are rolling pitifully down Andy's cheeks. The manager is confused totally disoriented. Shamed, Andy covers his face, then runs out. Silence. The manager stares after him. having no idea what just happened.
THUG #1: Give us your wallet. Andy stares fearfully. An anxious moment. He thinks. considering his options. Then, he suddenly stammers in a thick FOREIGN ACCENT.
THUG #1: Give us your money!
THUG #1: What's in the case?
THUG #2: Shut up! Gimme that thing! The guy snatches the case. He impulsively BREAKS the lock. and clothes, congas and records fall out. The thugs are dismayed.
THUG #1: Goddamn immigrants!
THUG #2: This guy's pathetic. Let's go. Harsh glances. They angrily turn and leave. Andy takes a nervous breath, then starts picking his things off the street. He shouts after the guys:
WISEASS COMIC: So I'm getting my mother-in-law a special Christmas present: A pre- paid funeral! The mortician asked me if I wanted her buried, embalmed or cremated. I said, "Make it all three! I'm not takin' any chances!" Thank you. Good night! The comic waves and exits. APPLAUSE. George politely claps. A PIANO PLAYER jumps in with an upbeat show tune. We think there's a break. when Andy suddenly, awkwardly steps on stage. He is in character as Foreign Man. Pink jacket, tie, hair slicked back, frightened like a deer in headlights. He puts down his big case, pulls out various junk, and arranges it on chairs. The room hushes, uncertain as to who the hell this guy is. Andy tentatively grabs the mike. The stagefright is agony.
GEORGE: Pst. What's the story with this I think he's Lithuanian. None of us can understand him. George nods admiringly.
BUDD: I think he's Lithuanian. None of us can understand him. George nods admiringly.
GEORGE: He does a hell of an Elvis.
GEORGE: Hey, I really enjoyed your set.
GEORGE: So I understand you're from No. Caspiar. George is puzzled.
GEORGE: Caspiar? I haven't heard of that.
GEORGE: Oh. Hm. I'm uh, sorry. Well, look, I'm probably out of my mind but I think you're very interesting. If you ever need representation. we should talk. George hands him a BUSINESS CARD. Andy reads it then his eyes pop. He DROPS the accent.
ANDY: Mr. Shapiro, it's an honor!! George realizes it's all been an act. He laughs heartily.
GEORGE: Caspiar, huh?!
ANDY: You see, I want to be the biggest star in the world. George is surprised at this hubris.
GEORGE: People love. comedians.
ANDY: I'm not a comedian. I have no I'm a song-and-dance man. George looks up at Andy and inexplicably there is a giant MOIST BOOGER hanging from Andy's nostril. George cringes. He doesn't know what to say. A waitress brings over two plates of awful 70's HEALTH FOOD seaweed, beans, stringy paste. George frowns. Andy Mmm! I particularly recommend the Lotus root. Andy pulls out a little Handi-wipe and cleanses his hands. Then he starts arranging the food in compulsive little piles: Beans in pinwheel shapes. Sprouts in piles. George peers at the bizarre food behavior.
GEORGE: You show a lot of promise. but. my concern is I don't know where to book you. You're not a stand-up. your act doesn't exactly translate to films. help me. where do you see yourself?
ANDY: ( bright ) I've always wanted to play Carnegie George is unsure if that's a joke.
GEORGE: Yeah, ha-ha. That's funny. Andy dips his silverware in the water glass. Two dunks, then he dries it with his napkin. George stares, perplexed. He looks back up and Andy's booger has suddenly switched nostrils. See, I don't want easy laughs. Andy's about to eat but first bows his head in silent prayer. George raises an eyebrow. Andy snaps his head back I want gut reactions! I want that audience to go through an experience. They love me! They hate me! They walk out it's all
ANDY: See, I don't want easy laughs. Andy's about to eat but first bows his head in silent prayer. George raises an eyebrow. Andy snaps his head back I want gut reactions! I want that audience to go through an experience. They love me! They hate me! They walk out it's all
GREAT!: Andy triumphantly eats a bean. George peers, unable to take the booger anymore. He hands Andy a napkin and points to his nose. Andy nods, removes the rubber booger, and carefully puts it in a little box. And at that. George is won over. He smiles broadly.
GEORGE: You're insane. But you might also be brilliant. Alright, Andy. let's do it. George warmly extends his hand. Andy slowly smiles, then takes George's hand. The men shake. A moment of supreme importance.
GEORGE: Sammy, opening for David Brenner is a fine gig. You'll be on the road. get some exposure. O.S., a SECRETARY shouts out.
GEORGE: SECRETARY ( O.S. ) He says he's an associate of Andy ( back to the phone ) Sammy, think about it. I gotta go. ( he punches a line ) Hello? George Shapiro here. On the phone, a STACCATO, ABRASIVE NASAL VOICE blares.

GEORGE: ( stunned ) Who is this?
GEORGE: Look. I don't know what your problem is.
LITTLE WENDY: Now, while continuing your deep breathing, slowly open your eyes. You should feel rested, relaxed, and The students all open their eyes.
YOGI: Do any thoughts come.?

YOGI: We are all impressed. Andy smiles beatifically. This means a lot.
LITTLE WENDY: Okay. Anyone else ?
ANDY: Oh, wait! I have a question. Is there. is there a secret to being funny? Huh? The Yogi thinks hard. squinching up his face. Then. he finally speaks.
YOGI: Yes. Silence.
CAROL: I still can't believe my brother's gonna be on TV.!
JANICE: I hope he doesn't get nervous.
STANLEY: What's the difference? This thing's on in the middle of the night no one's even gonna see it. The commercial ends, and the "APPLAUSE" sign blinks. The crowd APPLAUDS. An "ON THE AIR" sign lights up.
HOST: Welcome back to Saturday Night Live! And now, as a special treat on our first show. musical guest ANDY
KAUFMAN!!!: The SNL orchestra starts the intro into a song. Andy enters the stage with a boom box, and positions himself in front of the microphone. When the vocals are supposed to start, Andy doesn't open his mouth. Instead he looks around frightened. The band stops. and starts again. Andy remains mute. The Band stops again.
LORNE MICHAELS: What's happening to him?
LORNE MICHAELS: Oh my God, he's doing nothing. It's dead air.!

ANDY: "No"? "No" to which part??
GEORGE: "No"? "No" to which part??
ANDY: No to the whole thing. None of it sounds good. George is flummoxed.
GEORGE: Andy. this is every comedian's I told you, I'm not a comedian. And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter.

ANDY: I refuse.
GEORGE: ( he explodes ) LISTEN, you arrogant putz! I've been in this business for twenty years! I know! If you walk away from this opportunity, you will never, NEVER see another one like it Long pause. Andy stares at George, amazed at this passion. Then Andy gets up and looks around the office. He stares at the awards. the gold records. emblems of success and Andy thinks then nods.
ANDY: Okay. Fine, I'll do it. But I have a few terms.
GEORGE: ( relieved ) Of course! That's what negotiations are for. Andy starts to write on a piece of paper. GEORGE ( cont'd ) What are you doing?
ANDY: Writing down my terms. George watches patiently. Andy clicks his pen, done. George smiles and takes the list. He scans it. then his face gets totally befuddled.
GEORGE: Are you makin' fun of me ? This is RIDICULOUS!
ANDY: ( blasй ) Those are my terms.
GEORGE: They're IMPOSSIBLE!! Jesus! I mean "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??! Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!
ANDY: He's a Vegas entertainer. I used to do impressions of him. We sorta. got in a fight over that. George gets a look.
GEORGE: This Clifton called me up. He's a loon! He HATES you!
ANDY: Nah, he just talks tough. But I owe him one. Andy smiles ingenuously, then turns stern. If I'm the new Fonz. ABC's just gonna have to give me what I want.
IMPRESSION ): George winces. He stares at the list.
GEORGE: Mr. Kaufman will only appear in half the episodes. Mr. Kaufman requires an undisturbed 90 minutes of meditation prior to Mr. Kaufman won't rehearse.

GEORGE: ANDY ( O.S. ) Hi George!

GEORGE: That's alright. Where.?
ANGRY GUY: Goddamn, I paid five dollars for And now! A man who needs no introduction. TONY CLIFTON! The band starts playing lounge standard "VOLARE". And then, obnoxious TONY CLIFTON swaggers out. Tony has a rubbery face, black wig and moustache, sunglasses, a padded belly, and a peach tuxedo with blue shirt and velvet piping. Tony stops, smirks at the audience, and sucks on a cigarette. He blows smoke rings at them.
TONY CLIFTON: Heh-heh. How ya all doin'? The crowd is furious.
ANGRY GUY: Fuck you! People light back up and start talking. Tony ignores the ruckus. He starts SINGING, pinched and off-key.
TONY CLIFTON: ( singing ) Whoa, whoa. Whoa whoa whoa whoa." George winces. He's horrible. TONY CLIFTON ( cont'd ) ( singing ) "I got the wings of your love, I got the wings of a dove. I got the. uh.

People BOO AND HURL THINGS. Bob starts weeping, then bolts up and runs from the And stay out, Fatso! The room erupts, outraged. George covers his face, looking ill. Suddenly, Tony snaps at him.
ANDY: And YOU. I wanna see you backstage! George is rattled.
GEORGE: Alright, I'm here. What do you Tony puts down his fork. He pauses. slowly turns around. and is Andy. George GASPS. His eyes bulge. Andy smiles innocently. He gestures to an empty seat.
ANDY: Are you hungry? George is breathing heavily, like someone about to have a heart attack. His brain melting, he shakily reaches for a chair and sits. George glances down. Lying alongside the food is Tony's rubber face.
GEORGE: I. I-I don't understand this act.

ZMUDA: Hey Andy, good show.
ANDY: Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda. Bob and I have been buddies for years. George gapes. On closer inspection, Bob is cocky, aloof, and conniving. He and Andy grin naughtily at each other.
ZMUDA: That was a really hot house!
GEORGE: So your name's not Gorsky.
ZMUDA: Don't believe everything you hear. George thinks about this then laughs.
GEORGE: This has to stay in the room. but here's the thing: Andy is Tony. And Tony is Andy! They'll deny it up and down, but I swear to God, they're the same person! It's smart business! You'll get two Andy Kaufmans for the price of one! Maynard thinks about this, quite methodically. A beat, and then he cracks a smile.
GEORGE: ( still playing the game ) What's up? George grins crazily, ecstatically.
ANDY: ( still playing the game ) What's up? George grins crazily, ecstatically.
GEORGE: Andy. THEY SAID YES! They agreed to it all! They thought your terms were a shining example of your "irreverent wit" and precisely why they want you! You're getting EVERYTHING! Whoa. Andy looks up, astonished. His space station EXPLODES, but he doesn't notice. He turns to George. and slowly smiles sweetly. Genuinely.

Henceforth, tonight, I'd like to grace you with a reading of the greatest novel ever "The Great Gatsby", by F. Scott Heh? The crowd isn't quite clear if this is good or bad. A confused murmur.
LATKA!!!: The audience ROARS approvingly. Andy stops reading and looks at the student. He smiles.
PROMOTER: Is he ever going to stop?
ZMUDA: ( dour ) Sure. When he reaches "The End."
WEAK VOICE: Do Latka. Andy looks up, shocked. Insulted, he "blows his temper."
ZMUDA: Nobody likes anarchy more than me. but this is science fiction! Andy nods uncomprehendingly.
ANDY: Let's get some breakfast.
GEORGE: What kind of show was this??! There were three-hundred walkouts! The promoter wants a refund! Andy mumbles in a pipsqueak whimper.
ANDY: I'm sorry, George.
GEORGE: You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry! And you you're the road manager! You should be watchin' out for him!
ZMUDA: ( a guilty sigh ) We might have lost our focus. George paces furiously.
GEORGE: When you play the Midwest and South, you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It's not postmodern it's rude. If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse! You give 'em But George, I like to push the And that's great. But do it in LA and New York! There you experiment! Show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage! I don't care! Hmm. Andy thinks.
ANDY: But George, I like to push the And that's great. But do it in LA and New York! There you experiment! Show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage! I don't care! Hmm. Andy thinks.
GEORGE: And that's great. But do it in LA and New York! There you experiment! Show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage! I don't care! Hmm. Andy thinks.
ANDY: How long would they let me sleep?
GEORGE: I don't know! Andy. you need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain? The audience. or yourself?
GEORGE: I'm worried about Andy. His stress level is affecting his work.
ZMUDA: ( he thinks ) Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon? Maybe that'll chill him out.
GEORGE: Bob, Andy needs to RELAX. See if you can get him away from all this. Take him to Hawaii, or Bali. Find something special. Something Zmuda mulls this over.
ANDY: I dunno about this. What will my mother think?
ZMUDA: She'll say, "Now my son is a man."
ANDY: It's so dirty.
ZMUDA: Nah. The girls sponge off between Andy nods.
ANDY: INT. MUSTANG RANCH - DAY The reception room wood paneling and black-lite posters. Music is playing. Twenty deadpan HOOKERS are lined up. Andy, nervous as a high school kid, points at one. then another. then the first.
ZMUDA: Which one? Beat then Andy becomes GERMAN, with a monocle and stiff I vill haf both! I vill haf dat fraulein. unt. the vun vith the big strudels! The two chosen girls take Andy's hands and lead him off. He reaches the door then gives Zmuda a nervous look. Zmuda smiles reassuringly. Andy gulps, and goes in. Beat. Zmuda turns to the older, jaded MADAM.
ZMUDA: This is a big day. It's my friend's first time with a prostitute.
MADAM: ( mocking ) What're you talking about? Andy comes here almost every weekend. Zmuda's jaw drops, stupefied.
ZMUDA: You're talking about. Andy?
MADAM: Oh, he doesn't always call himself that. Sometimes he's Tony, and wears a tux. Disbelief then Zmuda LAUGHS sharply. He's been conned.
ANDY: You let me win.
HOOKER: ( she giggles sexily ) What if we did.?! Andy grins and leans down.
ANDY: Hey. If I give you three-hundred dollars, will you come to LA and help me destroy a TV show?
TONY DANZA: Where is he?
ED: He just arrived.
CAROL KANE: He's an hour late.
ED: Look, I'm told this Clifton guy is a little eccentric. You're all just gonna have to roll with the punches this week. Suddenly the door SLAMS open. Tony bounds in, filthy drunk, clutching a bottle in a brown bag.
TONY CLIFTON: Taxi! Laxy! Just the factsy, Maxie! Them's all the words that rhyme with taxi!. Right, girls? Little Wendy and the Hooker sashay in, dressed as tarts. Tony feels them up, and they SQUEAL. The cast stares in Eh, why the blue faces? You musta read the script! Well, don't worry! Your pal Tony stayed up all night, writin' some fixes on it.
TONY CLIFTON: And now, the new theme song! "Oh yes, we drive a taxi,
ED: George, we've lost two days. Filming is on Friday. We HAVE to let him go!
GEORGE: ( worried ) I'm not sure how Andy's gonna take So we'll go downstairs and tell him! He points at Tony, swaggering around on the set. George shakes his head.
ED: So we'll go downstairs and tell him! He points at Tony, swaggering around on the set. George shakes his head.
GEORGE: But that's Tony down there. That's not Andy. Trust me, it's like "Sybil" Andy's nowhere on the Ed glares.
ED: Well whoever the fuck that is, I'm firing him!
GEORGE: ( he sighs ) Okay. But we'll have to warn Andy first. I think he's up in San Francisco, doing a concert. Heh? Ed raises his eyebrows.
GEORGE: Hi, Andy. How's the weather up Oh, you know the Bay Area! Always Ed looks totally off-balance. George winks at him.
GEORGE: I'm here with Ed over at Taxi. There's been some trouble with Tony.
ED: No, no, Andy, nothing like that. But. Tony's not fitting in. His style of performance is too. INT. TAXI SET, ANDY'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY Tony is on the phone. Little Wendy is busily refilling his whiskey bottle with canned ice tea. He looks up, insulted.
ED: Andy, I'm calling you up like this because I have the utmost respect for your artistry. But I need your permission to fire him.
GEORGE: There'll be other shots.
ED: Andy, I have to do it. He's a terrible actor. Andy thinks about this.
ED: Yes, Andy, I will. Andy hangs up. A relieved Ed turns to George. Thank you.
TONY CLIFTON: FUCK YOU! I AIN'T GOIN'!! Ed is stupefied. The cast stands nervously behind him.
WIDE: Ed is stupefied. The cast stands nervously behind him.
ED: We had a deal!!
TONY CLIFTON: I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else
ED: Yeah!! I talked to Andy Kaufman!
TONY CLIFTON: I don't know nothin' about no Kaufman. He's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. Been usin' my good name, to get Ed is livid. He gazes harshly at Tony Tony's burning eyes piercing through the rubber features.
ED: Get off my stage! You're fired!
TONY CLIFTON: I GOT A CONTRACT!! I'm gonna take you to the DEPARTMENT OF LABOR! Suddenly FLASH! Ed looks over. A REPORTER has a camera.
ED: Who're YOU?!
REPORTER: I'm from the LA Times. We're doing a little puff piece on Mr. Clifton. Mr. Kaufman arranged it. UP IN THE BLEACHERS - George enters. He looks down at the growing debacle, and winces. Uh-oh. ONSTAGE - Enraged, Ed blows up.
ED: Security! Escort this man off the ONSTAGE - Studio SECURITY GUARDS run over. They GRAB Tony.
TONY CLIFTON: Stop! GETCHER HANDS OFF ME! Tony scuffles. The camera FLASHES.
ED: I don't want those pictures getting This is a closed set. You'll have to give me the film in that camera. The Guard reaches for the camera. An uncertain moment. until Zmuda authoritatively cuts in, from out of nowhere.
SECURITY GUARD: ( to the reporter ) This is a closed set. You'll have to give me the film in that camera. The Guard reaches for the camera. An uncertain moment. until Zmuda authoritatively cuts in, from out of nowhere.
ZMUDA: I'll take care of this. Zmuda takes the camera. He casually starts to make his way for the exit. when Ed suddenly HOLLERS.
ED: Wait he's one of THEM! Zmuda gasps. Two guards go running for him. Zmuda barrels away, trying to escape. The guards chase. Zmuda races by George, and suddenly palms off the camera into George's arms. The guards whip by, oblivious. George grimaces, unclear about his loyalties. He sweatily peers at the timebomb in his hands. And then George thrusts it under his jacket. He bolts for the door and feverishly scampers out.
TONY CLIFTON: Stop! HELP! You wouldn't do this to Wayne Newton The guards toss Tony out the gate. He lands in a heap. In the b.g., George crazily flies by. He gets out the exit.
TONY CLIFTON: Hey. Good hustlin'. George slowly smiles.
ED: That asshole! That FUCKING
BASTARD!!: ( he SLAMS the door behind him ) We had a fuckin' deal, and THAT
SECRETARY: Um, Ed. you have a phone call
ED: I'M NOT IN! Well, um. it's Andy Kaufman. Heh??! Shaking with fury, Ed stares at the telephone. then slowly picks it up.
SECRETARY: Well, um. it's Andy Kaufman. Heh??! Shaking with fury, Ed stares at the telephone. then slowly picks it up.
ED: A long pause. then Andy's voice calmly speaks.
ED: ANDY ( V.O. ) You were in the moment. You became a producer losing his mind. ( sincerely joyful ) It was the best improv I've ever TIGHT - ED He thinks intently about this. And then. amazingly, a magnificent smiles comes over his face.
ED: Well thank you. Okay. See you next week. Andy hangs up. Ed just sits there, astounded.
ANDY: This is great! It makes Tony REAL - - three-dimensional! It's very good for his career. Zmuda reads one paragraph.
ZMUDA: "Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman? And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy Kaufman crazy?"
ANDY: ( he chortles ) Boy, they totally fell for it! I'm only acting crazy! Hmm. A few awkward glances. Then Andy grins at his meal. ANDY ( cont'd ) Boy, this is tasty. ( he shouts to a
WAITER ): Hey, can I please have some more INT. BOOKER'S OFFICE - DAY A slick BOOKER, sitting in a crowded office full of head shots. He's on the phone. He's reading the LA Times story.
BOOKER: Mr. Shapiro, this is Gene Knight, up at Harrah's Tahoe. We'd like to book Andy Kaufman for our showroom.
GEORGE: Ehh Andy doesn't really like playing casinos. The audiences don't work well for him.
GEORGE: ( startled ) Really?! You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe??
GEORGE: Look I gotta be clear with you. Tony Clifton is NOT Andy Kaufman.
GEORGE: ( frustrated ) No, I'm serious. If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
GEORGE: Fine, be my guest! Book him.
ONLY!": George is flabbergasted.
GEORGE: Gene, you misunderstood!! You're not getting BOTH of them! It's physically impossible!
GEORGE: Yeah, I KNOW what I said! But trust me, it's not gonna happen!
PUSHY MAN: You're not listenin'! It's a VERY simple concept.
PUSHY MAN: Trust me! You'll never see them on stage at the same time! The onstage ORCHESTRA hits a fanfare. LIGHTS DIM. Sharp SPOTLIGHTS meet at the foot of the stage. Suddenly Tony swaggers out, hands over his head in a gesture of triumph. Thunderous APPLAUSE. Tony beams. The music stops. George leans in, curious as to how Andy will wiggle out of Tony bows theatrically, turns back to face the orchestra, and waits. The NOISE LEVEL slowly drops but not entirely. Tony waits, and waits, and waits. until suddenly he turns towards the audience and SCREAMS
TONY CLIFTON: SHUT UP!!!!!! Everybody looks up, alarmed. The general murmur almost dies. Tony stands there, eyes flashing with anger at all the unruly people. As they quiet down. Tony turns back to the orchestra and raises his arms. The MUSICIANS lift their instruments. Silence is total except for the clank of Waiters are serving coffee. Tony spins back around, livid.
SHUT UP!!!!!!: Everybody looks up, alarmed. The general murmur almost dies. Tony stands there, eyes flashing with anger at all the unruly people. As they quiet down. Tony turns back to the orchestra and raises his arms. The MUSICIANS lift their instruments. Silence is total except for the clank of Waiters are serving coffee. Tony spins back around, livid.
PENGUINS!!!: People signal "shh"! The waiters realize Tony's addressing them, and they stare back in disbelief! This is their job! Tony's outburst is so commanding that they all freeze. The waiters stand there like statues, staring in terror. Satisfied, Tony burns back to the orchestra and raises his arms. Again, the musicians lift their instruments. In anticipation of loud music, the waiters start moving about. Audience members start whispering. Tony hears this and drops his arms and head in despair. The musicians lower their instruments. Tony waits for absolute silence. Only then does he signal the musicians to get ready again. They do. And then at that precise moment somebody DROPS a spoon. Tony jolts, as if hit by a current. He drops his hands again, turns, and gives the perpetrator a murderous look. Then he turns again, lowers his head, and waits. And waits. And waits. The man at George's table WHISPERS to his wife.
PUSHY MAN: He's never gonna start! Kaufman thinks this is funny! We've paid forty bucks for a show that's never gonna start! George grins stupidly. The silence is now deafening. Slowly, very slowly, Tony raises his arms. Slowly. the musicians get their instruments ready. Tony stands there, and stands, and stands, waiting for something. anything. to disturb the silence. In vain. Somebody COUGHS. The whole scene repeats itself. Finally finally Tony is surrounded by total silence. Then, ( only a moment before the length of this scene would become unbearable ), he begins to move. Tony pivots around, looks at the audience. And the entire room looks like Tussaud's Wax Museum. Tony starts LAUGHING hysterically. The audience's reaction is Some people LAUGH. Some BOO. Some ask perplexed questions. Some SCREAM OBSCENITIES. Some even APPLAUD. Tony is very happy. He turns to the orchestra, raises his baton and commences the downbeat! The MUSIC BEGINS. A SPOTLIGHT hits the wings. and then ANDY STRIDES OUT. George's jaw drops.
TONY CLIFTON: Thank you! Thank you! I wrote this tune for my friend Frank Sinatra. He had a nice little success with it. but forgot to thank me on the He starts to BELT "I Gotta Be Me". George squints his eyes, trying to figure out who this is. "Whether I'm right Tony's singing is awful. Andy happily accompanies on congas. The audience doesn't know what to think. Tony's SINGING reaches the end. aggressive and off-key. Let's bring it on home
GEORGE: You're so proud. You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "Look, Dad, I got an F!"
ANDY: But wasn't it funny?
GEORGE: "Funny"? I dunno. But "intriguing". "mindboggling". perhaps "headache-inducing". sure. Like, that moment, when you both came onstage. Andy excitedly jumps up and down.
ANDY: Uh-huh! See, with all these articles, people think they're insiders. They see Tony Clifton, and they say, "Ah, that's really Andy Kaufman." But that spoils it. So NOW, Tony denying being me is the truth! Tony's not me! But maybe he is! The audience will never know. They'll think they're laughin' at me but actually I'll be laughin' at them, because they're wrong and I'm George is dazed.
GEORGE: So you've got this big elaborate joke, which is really only funny to two people in the universe. You. and you.
ZMUDA: Sure! But WE think it's kickass! Now I get to be Tony. I get to dump the glass of water on someone else's But what's the POINT? How will any of this make you the biggest star in the world? Hmm. Andy contemplates this.
GEORGE: ( he turns serious ) But what's the POINT? How will any of this make you the biggest star in the world? Hmm. Andy contemplates this.
ANDY: George. I'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them. But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, I don't know what else to do. 'Cause I've always got to be one step ahead of them.
GEORGE: But I feel you're extending this philosophy to real life. It's obsessive. Nothing's ever on the level anymore. A perplexed beat.
ANDY: George, it never was. Didn't you know that?
ANDY: Look at this! An evil Russian! Ooo, here's an evil Nazi he likes to fight dirty! Hey, here's an evil Japanese guy!
ZMUDA: What is this, World War Two.?
ANDY: You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler.
ZMUDA: No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it. These he- men'll kick your ass!! They're Andy's face drops. He realizes Zmuda's right. Beat then Andy notices an issue of Sumo Magazine, with a picture of a wrestler and his cute little fiancйe on the cover. He slowly lifts it up, intrigued.
ANDY: Maybe I'll pick on someone smaller than me.!
ANDY: . And I vow to continue wrestling until I am BEA TEN, in a three- minute match, with my shoulders pinned to the mat!!
MERV: ( nonplussed ) By a woman.
ANDY: Yes! BY A WOMAN! I'm doing this because I feel that a woman cannot beat a man in wrestling. Even if they train with weights. it requires a certain mental ability And, uh I just don't feel they have that. The audience MURMURS uncomfortably. Andy laughs and No no! Women are superior in many ways. When it comes to cooking and cleaning, washing the potatoes, scrubbing the carrots, raising the babies, mopping the floors, they have it all over men. I believe An appalled silence. Merv winces. Some people start BOOING. We can tell Andy is But when it comes to wrestling, forget it! If there's a woman that can prove me wrong, come up here. I'll shut my mouth and pay her 500 Merv baitingly turns to the crowd.
MERV: Any. volunteers.?
WIDE: All the WOMEN'S hands angrily shoot up! We move through the crowd, finally picking out. a feisty woman, LYNNE. She mutters, half hateful, half laughing
LYNNE: I wanna kill that jerk.
ANDY: I'm the winner! I've got the
BRAINS!: ( he points at his head ) Now baby, don't fight nature! Get back in the kitchen where you Lynne glares. Out of the blue, and old RECORDING OF BOUNCY PIANO MUSIC starts playing. A chicken CLUCKS to the music, and Andy lip- syncs along, doing an obnoxious cock o' the walk around the INT. MERV GRIFFIN SHOW, BACKSTAGE - LATER THAT DAY Lynne is escorted by a GUEST COORDINATOR. Lynne is dazed. The Coordinator hands her a bunch of crap.
GUEST COORDINATOR: Here's your complimentary photo with Merv. Here's your Turtle Wax
LYNNE: I don't need Turtle Wax.
GUEST COORDINATOR: Every guest of Merv gets it. And here's your dinner-for-two voucher at Red Lobster. Lynne takes her junk and hobbles off. She passes Andy, who sees her and grins.
ANDY: Gosh, you scored! Look at all those Buzz off. Go patronize somebody Lynne coldly hurries away. Andy chases after her.
LYNNE: Buzz off. Go patronize somebody Lynne coldly hurries away. Andy chases after her.
ANDY: Hey, I hope you didn't take that stuff I said seriously. It was just part of the show! It's like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd.
LYNNE: Oh. So you were just pretending to be an asshole. Andy nods, pleased.
ANDY: It's what I'm good at! Lynne stares then begrudgingly cracks a smile.
GEORGE: Merv Griffin has received 2000 pieces of hate mail. Andy, Merv Griffin doesn't GET hate mail.
ANDY: That means it was a success. I woke up the audience like punk rock!
BARBELL ): Here, take this.
GEORGE: No, I'm not gonna take it. If I take it I'll break my back. He crosses his arms. Andy frowns and lowers the weight. Buddyboy, they detest you! Next time you make an appearance, women are gonna picket.
ANDY: They're having a laugh.
GEORGE: WRONG! You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
ANDY: That's because they've only seen it once. But I'll do it again, and again, and AGAIN. They'll catch on!
ANDY: I am the Intergender Wrestling Champion of the World!!! The crowd BOOS in disgust.
ANDY: Two, please. Two tickets jump out of the machine.
ANDY: Hi. am I late?
LYNNE: Hi. am I late?
ANDY: No, I'm sure we'll be fine. Andy gives Lynne her ticket. They enter the theater.
ANDY: No thanks.
LYNNE: No thanks.
ANDY: I really want one. One large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter. The CANDY GIRL makes Andy his popcorn. He pays. then heads to the exit. Okay. Let's go. Lynne is baffled.
LYNNE: Andy, the theater's that way!
ANDY: Hey, I love movie theater popcorn. but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond." Lynne stands in place. Andy smiles. C'mon. We'll go for a walk.
LYNNE: ( beat; then she laughs ) She throws down her ticket and runs after him.
LYNNE: Why did you call me? The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
ANDY: Gosh. Gee, Lynne. I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
ANDY: Hi. am I late?
LYNNE: Hi. am I late?
ANDY: No, I'm sure we'll be fine. Andy gives Lynne her ticket. They enter the theater.
ANDY: No thanks.
LYNNE: No thanks.
ANDY: I really want one. One large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter. The CANDY GIRL makes Andy his popcorn. He pays. then heads to the exit. Okay. Let's go. Lynne is baffled.
LYNNE: Andy, the theater's that way!
ANDY: Hey, I love movie theater popcorn. but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond." Lynne stands in place. Andy smiles. C'mon. We'll go for a walk.
LYNNE: ( beat; then she laughs ) She throws down her ticket and runs after him.
LYNNE: Why did you call me? The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
ANDY: Gosh. Gee, Lynne. I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
LYNNE: You were impressed with something. It's pretty odd when a man sports a hard-on that large on national Andy is shocked.
ANDY: Oh! Uh, I hope I didn't offend you.
LYNNE: I'm here, ain't I? A charged moment. Andy's eyes widen. His speech gets Do you wanna to go to Memphis and get married?
ANDY: Do you wanna to go to Memphis and get married?
LYNNE: ( incredulous ) Do I wanna go to Memphis and get Why Memphis?
ANDY: Why Memphis?
LYNNE: Why Memphis?
ANDY: ( he SPEAKS VERY
FAST ): Because Memphis is the wrestling capital of the world! I'll go in the ring, and I'll announce that I will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me! Then you'll come up, we'll wrestle and I'll let you win! Then you'll scalp me, and we'll get married on Letterman, like Tiny Tim did on Carson. right there on the show! What do you Whoa. Lynne stares into his eyes.
LYNNE: And all this will be for real?
ANDY: ( a soft smile ) If you want.
ANDY: ( screaming )
SHUT UP!: ( more BOOS ) SHUT UP! Show some respect! I want SILENCE when I speak! People BOOO louder and throw debris. Andy is pleased. ANDY ( cont'd ) If any woman can defeat me, I will pay her 1000 dollars! Then I'll shave my head bald! And then as a bonus that lucky lady will get to marry me!! Screeching JEERS and CATCALLS. Down front. Lynne jumps Look here, Andy Kaufman! I'll take you on SISSY! The mob LAUGHS harshly.
LYNNE: Look here, Andy Kaufman! I'll take you on SISSY! The mob LAUGHS harshly.
ANDY: Ooo, the little lady's upset. Well I say get back in the kitchen!
LYNNE: ( "outraged" ) No! YOU get in the kitchen. I'm gonna make you dry my dishes! The crowd APPLAUDS. Lynne grins and starts to climb in the ring. Andy's eyes are ablaze. But suddenly an oversized Southern MAN jumps in and snatches the mike away.
MAN: STOP IT! This woman's a FAKE! She's nothing but Kaufman's Andy and Lynne are startled.
ANDY: T-that's not true
MAN: It's a set-up! And I won't allow our great sport to be degraded by a The crowd angrily starts to HISS. Lynne whispers to Andy.
LYNNE: Andy. who is that.?
LAWLER: I'm Jerry Lawler, the KING of Memphis wrestling!!
CHEERS ): So if Kaufman wants to tangle, I've brought a real wrestler! She's trained and she's READY!! Kaufman, do you think you can handle. FOXY
JACKSON???!!!: At that, a striking, muscular black woman stands FOXY. The coliseum SCREAMS with excitement. People POUND their seats. The roar is deafening. Lawler gleams cockily. Lynne looks worriedly at Andy he's concerned.
TATTOOED GUY: Are you scared??? Andy sneers. He cracks his knuckles, finally walks over. and commences a WINDMILL. Absurdly, he spins his arms around and around, daring Foxy to get near him. She rolls her eyes and waits. The REF jumps out of the way. A minute has counted down. Finally, Andy stops and the real wrestling begins. Foxy lunges at him and immediately goes for a choke-hold. The crowd CHEERS, relieved. Lawler motions signals. Foxy yanks but Andy jerks away. Andy is intrigued. She's coming to play! Andy gestures to the Ref and points UP. The Ref looks away and Andy SLAPS The crowd furiously JEERS. The Ref spins around, and Andy shrugs innocence. He then runs at Foxy and theatrically pushes her into the ropes. She bounces off, stumbles back - - and Andy drops to his knees. She trips over him and hits the mat. Andy aggressively jumps onto Foxy's shoulders and pins her. The Ref counts: One! Two! Three! DING!! It's over. But Andy stays on her, shaking his ass, leering rudely. Jerry Lawler yells from the corner.
LAWLER: Alright, you won. GET OFF HER! Andy remains, flapping his arms like a chicken. THE BOOING grows. Louder. More emotional.
ANGRY VOICES: Jerry, help her! Get in there! Do Lawler hesitates then suddenly climbs in the ring and lifts Andy off! Lawler angrily PUSHES Andy down. Andy is flabbergasted.
ANDY: W-what are you DOING? I don't fight Lawler snickers and walks away. Completely overreacting, Andy grabs the mike. I'm gonna SUE YOU! Let me tell you something, Lawler! I am not a hick I'm a national TV star! And I DON'T like a dumb cracker pushing me around in the ring! I never agreed to wrestle you! So you know what I'm gonna I'm gonna hire a lawyer to sue you for every cent you've got! This was assault and battery! In a court of law, I'm gonna kick your Southern- fried rump!!! Lawler snatches the mike and bellows.
LAWLER: YEAH?! Well I got news for you, Andy Kaufman! Wrestling is a serious sport to me! I don't like anyone makin' fun of it, and I hate anyone insultin' the South! So we can settle this two ways: We can go to court. or you can get in the ring with a man, and wrestle for
REAL!: Andy watches, fuming. He is INFURIATED.
ANDY: He can't get away with this. YOU! You think I'm CHICKEN?! Andy grabs back the mike. He sticks his face in shocked
ACCENT ): You wanna "wraaastle" me?! You wanna "WRAAASTLE" me??? Okay, Lawler let's rumble! Yeah, I've only wrestled women, but they were bigger than you! In fact, they're probably smarter than you, 'cause you're from "Maaamphis, Taaanassee!" I'm from Hollywood. I have the brains. That's how I win. And Mr. Lawler, I'm gonna make you cry Andy bears his teeth. Enraged, Lawler tries to take a swing at him. HANDLERS run in and separate the angry men.
LYNNE: Is this an act or are you addicted to causing trouble??
ANDY: ( he jokingly impersonates a drunk ) I can shtop whenever I want. She's unamused.
LYNNE: Then stop treating me like a fucking I-I'm sorry. I got caught up in the She shoots him a stern look.
ANDY: ( he drops the act ) I-I'm sorry. I got caught up in the She shoots him a stern look.
LYNNE: I'm warning you, Kaufman: One morning you're gonna wake up. and your head's gonna be shaved. Andy laughs.
GEORGE: Andy, do you realize you don't do comedy anymore? Where's that sweet guy who used to do "Here I come to save the day!"? Please, enough with the wrestling! You've lost touch with reality!
ANDY: ( ingenuous ) What, you don't think I can beat He is the Southern Heavyweight Champion. He'll kill you. ( very disapproving ) First, you piss-off women. Then you piss-off the South. Then you get ( dry ) And I did the bookings. Andy shrugs, lacking a response. He eats more cake. GEORGE ( cont'd ) Andy, look. there's a job I want you to take guest-hosting the TV show "Fridays." It's not so hot. but this is a great opportunity for you. The show's live, they'll give you carte blanche, and you can get back to the business of making people laugh. Andy gets a strange gleam. He only heard one thing.
GEORGE: He is the Southern Heavyweight Champion. He'll kill you. First, you piss-off women. Then you piss-off the South. Then you get And I did the bookings. Andy shrugs, lacking a response.

ANDY: You said live?
ANDY: I'm not comfortable with the last sketch. I DON'T do drug humor!
JACK BURNS: Andy, it'll be fine! It's what we're known for! "Maui? "Wowie!"
ANDY: ( losing his temper ) You're not listening to me
JACK BURNS: Don't worry! The kids will love it
ANDY: ( he BLOWS up ) But I don't do drugs! And I don't enjoy making light of them!
ACTOR: What a prick!
STANLEY: It's on! JANICE, IT'S ON! Janice rushes in, still holding some dishes. ( THE FOLLOWING IS INTERCUT: Between the studio and the show on tv at Andy's parents. )
NARRATOR: In this next sketch, two married couples are out to dinner. Now. everybody has secretly brought along a joint So, when each person leaves the table, they sneak into the restroom to get a little high. The crowd CHEERS rowdily.

It reads "Andy, we're all praying for you. Your friends at Taxi." Andy chuckles.

SMUG COMIC: Hi. Um, we were supposed to have Andy Kaufman on our show this week - - but now our producers aren't sure if it's such a good idea.

To keep Andy, call 1-900-244-7618. To DUMP him, call.
ANDY: This is bad. I only got 28 percent! I'm like McGovern in
GEORGE: And this wasn't "Merv." This was the hippest audience on television. They've turned on you. At that. we reveal that SOMEONE ELSE is sitting next to Andy. But only the back of his head is visible. It's like you two guys wanted to destroy Andy's career! Upsetting all those people. putting out that toxic venom. What did you THINK would happen?!

ANDY: Jer', it's not your fault. You were But maybe George is right.
JERRY LAWLER: That's fine. But I wouldn't have traded it for anything. Because for one brief, shining moment. the world thought that wrestling was real. Andy gulps emotionally.
ANDY: We'll stay in touch. Next time I'm in Memphis, I'll stop by the house, and Noreen can make me her double chocolate cake.
JERRY LAWLER: Alright, buddy. Stay good. Andy and Jerry hug. A touching beat. until Andy gets a Quixotic gleam.
ANDY: Maybe I can turn it into a bit. I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged. Demand a recount.
GEORGE: Andy! You don't get it! They don't want you back. Andy's face drops.
ANDY: Open your eyes. close your eyes. open your eyes. close your eyes. open your eyes. close your eyes. Andy is repeating this faster and faster; the students are blinking their eyes faster and faster. The door opens. The Yogi sticks his head in.
YOGI: Excuse me, Andy.
ANDY: Yes, your Holiness? The Yogi signals Andy to step out of the room.
YOGI: This is very difficult for me to say. but perhaps it would be best if you didn't attend the Why?? I. I attend every year.

YOGI: It is apparently not working.
ANDY: So HELP ME! All I wanna do is

ANDY: You don't know the real me.
LYNNE: Andy. there is no real you.

ANDY: Um. no. Uh, I'm sorta busy right now. Thanks. We'll get together next week. Andy hangs up. He just sits there. confused. unsure how to react. Andy scratches his head then feels something odd. He goes over to the mirror. On the back of his neck. is an inflamed red pimple. Andy grimaces. INT. LA IMPROV, SHOWROOM - LATE NIGHT Very late a clock says 1:15. A YOUNG COMIC is onstage, performing to the DOZEN audience members left. In back walks. Andy. Unshaven, morose, he quietly approaches paternal owner BUDD FRIEDMAN.

BUDD: And now we have a treat for you late- night diehards. The star of Taxi here in person, Andy Kaufman! The sparse crowd APPLAUDS. Budd leaves, and Andy shuffles Actually, Budd, you're wrong. I found out today that Taxi's been The crowd AWWWWS sadly. Andy blinks. Yeah, that's how I felt too. though I don't know why. 'Cause for years, all I wanted to do was get off that show.

Not to mention that my wife has left me. And she took the kids. I don't know what I'm gonna do with myself. My options are sorta This morning, I noticed I've got a cyst, or some kind of boil, on the back of my neck. It's really disgusting. Look. Andy turns. The red lump is bigger, grosser. The crowd GROANS, revolted. So I was thinking, since I'm sort of a quasi-celebrity, that I could charge people to touch it. Does anybody want to pay a buck to touch my cyst? A couple stoners GIGGLE and CLAP. Andy COUGHS, then frowns. I'm serious. A pause. then a few curious people walk up to the stage. The first taker is a GOOFY BLONDE WOMAN. She starts to reach for the cyst when Andy stops her. No, no, you gotta pay first. She nods, discomforted, and reaches for her purse.

ANDY: Sir, do you have a problem?
ANDY: I, I was asked to do this material -
ANDY: ( defensive ) Hey that stuff gets written-up in the papers
GEORGE: ( to himself ) Why.? Andy, why.?
ZMUDA: I used to think you were original.
ANDY: I was very original!
ZMUDA: Yeah, exactly "was"! But now, you're creatively bankrupt. In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!! I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine. Isn't that true??? Andy shudders. The audience averts their eyes. A painful silence. "Andy Kaufman" has been destroyed.
ANDY: The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks. So I was just giving 'em what they Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just. lost a reason to love you. The guys stop walking. George gently speaks. You've gotta make the public embrace you again. You have to win back their sympathy.
GEORGE: ( sadly ) Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just. lost a reason to love you. The guys stop walking. George gently speaks. GEORGE ( cont'd ) You've gotta make the public embrace you again. You have to win back their sympathy.
ON ANDY: He nods.
ANDY: I'll come up with something.
LYNNE: Andy!!. Where are you? I've been worried sick. NOW??. Where do you want to meet?. Okay, I'll call Lynne's baffled.
ZMUDA: Look at that Grand Slam! Two eggs, two bacon, two sausage, two pancakes $2.99! How do they do it?
LYNNE: They get you on the coffee.
GEORGE: ( irritable ) Excuse me but could Andy tell us why we're here??? All heads turn. A long pause. Then Andy stiffly speaks.
ANDY: I have cancer. Beat. Zmuda nods.
ZMUDA: Hey, that's good! We can make that And we'll really drag it out. You get better, you get worse. you FORGET IT. It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this. Pause. Lynne is puzzled.
GEORGE: FORGET IT. It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this. Pause. Lynne is puzzled.
LYNNE: Andy, are you serious?
ZMUDA: ( grinning ) Serious like a heart attack! Hey, maybe I can push you around in some goofy wheelchair! Andy softly shakes his head.
ANDY: No, it's true. I have lung cancer.
GEORGE: That's ridiculous. You don't even I I got some freaky rare kind. It's called large-celled carcinoma. Lynne's eyes tear up. She hugs onto Andy.
ANDY: ( emphatic ) I I got some freaky rare kind. It's called large-celled carcinoma. Lynne's eyes tear up. She hugs onto Andy.
LYNNE: Jesus, Andy! Can they cure it?
ANDY: They don't know. they've gotta run more tests.
LYNNE: ( starting to cry ) Have you told your family?
ANDY: No, NO! Not yet. I feel bad I've jerked 'em around so many George and Zmuda glance skeptically at each other. Hmm. Confused, George leans in to Andy.
GEORGE: Andy. you look me in the eye, and tell me this is true. Andy gulps.
ANDY: George it's true.
GEORGE: If I find out you're behind this, I'll kill you.
ZMUDA: What are ya TALKIN' ABOUT?! I was the one saying I didn't believe it!
GEORGE: Exactly. That's the sort of thing you guys would work out to fuck me INT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE - DAY Andy is doing laundry. He empties the clean clothes, puts them in a basket, and carries them to the rug. Then he sits down and starts laying out pairs of socks in highly symmetrical patterns. Focused, impassive, Andy pointlessly orders the socks like the world depended on it. Lynne enters, emotionally wrecked. She stares in frustration at Andy's behavior.
LYNNE: How can you be so casual??!
ANDY: ( he shrugs ) Even if I'm dying I still need clean socks.
LYNNE: You're NOT DYING!
ANDY: Okay. You're probably right. He keeps working. Lynne loses it.
LYNNE: God, you're so detached!! Lynne storms out. Andy finishes his socks. Satisfied. he turns on the TV. ON THE TV: It's "Lassie." Little TIMMY is laid-up in bed, with a broken leg. Suddenly LASSIE runs in, holding a book. Lassie places the book on his lap. The boy smiles Thank you, girl. You're my best Timmy warmly embraces the dog. ANDY - is terribly touched.

ANDY: ( on phone ) INT. CEDARS SINAI, RADIATION ROOM - DAY powerful radiation.
DOCTOR: The cancer started in Andy's left arm and spread to his lungs. We've initiated an aggressive radiation program. see if we can eradicate the affected cells. Excuse me. I'll be right back.

STANLEY: ( angered ) How dare you make light of this!
CAROL: Dad, I cried when he broke his neck. He's not gettin' me again
STANLEY: ( impassioned ) Jesus! He's got lung cancer! A standoff moment. Carol loses it.
CAROL: See, that's exactly it! He picked lung cancer, because he doesn't smoke. That makes it weird! If he'd picked leukemia, it'd be totally believable, and we'd all be going, "Poor Andy, he's really sick." So he chose lung cancer, because he WANTS us to be scratching our heads, saying, "Is this real?"
JANICE: ( trying to convince herself ) Of course it's real. We're in a Mom, it's Cedars-Sinai! It's a showbiz hospital! Andy's studio friends probably run this place!
MICHAEL: Mom, it's Cedars-Sinai! It's a showbiz hospital! Andy's studio friends probably run this place!
CAROL: He plans these things out. He takes over, hires actors. Personally, I didn't think that "doctor" was very convincing.
MICHAEL: Did you notice his costume had the wrong shoes?
CAROL: ( excited ) Yeah! He didn't have doctor shoes! A moment of total silence. All four of them look at each other. Is there. a glimmer of hope?
MICHAEL: We all know he's talked about faking his own death.
STANLEY: Sure but what if he isn't? My son could be dying. and we're actin' like we're on Candid Camera.
ANDY: I see them. I see the white In the corner George stares. He's fighting his INT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT DAY The drapes are open. Sunlight streams in. Andy hugs the teacher goodbye, and the man leaves. George has been waiting in back.

ANDY: It's visualization therapy. He's helping me turn inward and fight the Long beat.
GEORGE: He's an actor. I remember him in "The In-Laws." Ah. Andy's eyes widen. His wheels are spinning fast.
ANDY: Uh, yes. that's true. But he's also ordained in holistic medicine. ON GEORGE - He glares, stewing. George is fed up. ON ANDY - An unspoken tension. Then suddenly, he breaks George, what am I supposed to do?! I'm sick, and I'm tryin' to get better. but everyone's lookin' at me funny! Even you come to my home and act like I'm puttin' on a skit!
GEORGE: You must take a little pleasure in Of course! But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support! I can't be surrounded by negative energy. George shakes his head.
ANDY: Of course! But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support! I can't be surrounded by negative energy. George shakes his head.
GEORGE: Andy, you're surrounded by what you create. You are the KING of negative energy.
ANDY: ( thrown ) Y-yeah? Well, then it has to stop! Because if these bad vibes get out. then everyone will be talkin' about how sick I am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then I'm dead. Andy struggles to remain composed. George sighs.
GEORGE: So how can I help you.?
ANDY: I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show. The best show anybody's ever seen!
GEORGE: Do you wanna tour the clubs?
ANDY: No clubs. I wanna reach the TOP! Carnegie Hall.! George gently smiles.

GEORGE: So who's gonna pay for it?
ANDY: Tony Clifton.
GEORGE: ( beat ) You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.

ANDY: Well, it's gettin' even better! 'Cause we found one of the original hobby horses! Do you do you think you could treat us to a few steps from "Jingle Jangle Jingle"? Eleanor starts to protest but Andy hands her the HOBBY HORSE. She blushes. Andy turns away, goes to the band, and starts conducting. They begin to PLAY "JINGLE JANGLE JINGLE." Eleanor awkwardly starts dancing in circles. Andy gets excited and conducts FASTER. Eleanor is sweating. She dances faster. Andy impatiently SPEEDS UP the MUSIC MORE. Eleanor desperately skips in circles, trying to keep up. when suddenly she grabs her heart. Eleanor stops and collapses. She's down. A horrified GASP from the crowd. The band stops playing. CREW MEMBERS run on from backstage. One checks her heart. She's not moving. Zmuda runs out, horrified.
ZMUDA: Is there a doctor in the house??! The crowd is stunned silent. Pause then one man stands. It's Michael. Straight-faced, he hurries out of his seat, sprints down the aisle, and goes on stage.

GEORGE: ( awkwardly ) You've got good days and bad days. Andy softly sighs.
ANDY: My hair is coming out.
GEORGE: ( whispers ) George silently pats Andy. Andy's energy is sapped, but he forces himself to be upbeat.
ANDY: I've got an idea for a new TV show for me to star in. It's called "Uncle Andy's Fun House" it'll be a Saturday morning thing where I can goof off with the kids. You know, puppets, magic tricks. George is choked up. He goes along with it.

ANDY: Hey. thanks for always backin' me. George clenches Andy's hand.
GEORGE: Did your doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?
ANDY: Ehhh, you know those guys. If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day. And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
GEORGE: ( startled ) Yeah! He's a psychic surgeon in the Philippines, and he's amazing! He rubs you and sucks the disease right Andy beams. George stares sadly.
