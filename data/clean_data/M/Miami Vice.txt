CROCKETT: How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?
TUBBS: Skin has to touch skin. That's the requirement for the warrant. Then he makes a credible excuse and he Her crew blackmailed and asset- stripped the last mark down to his social security.
GINA: This I gotta see. .the "make up an excuse and stop" Have faith.
CROCKETT: Have faith.
GINA: I have faith. In horoscopes and fortune cookies.
TUBBS: Switek pulling this off.? That's not faith; that's delusional.
GINA: Switek pulling this off.? That's not faith; that's delusional.
TUBBS: Damn, girl.
TUBBS: This is exciting.
RICK: That's 'cause nothing is happening.
CROCKETT: No shit.?
FRANK: ( it goes past him ) Yeah. This is their surveillance.how they video their marks? See, we jacked their fiber optics, like we piggybacked their signal. Get it?
TUBBS: They exit to.
UGO: Runnin' the Biscayne 200?
TUBBS: If a coupla new exhaust manifolds show up.

CROCKETT: Really? I did refugee relocation in Somalia. But they transferred me out after I was wounded.
GINA: Only African he ever "relocated" was a $2,000-an-hour Nigerian model for Gucci, and he got wounded when she took an NBA draft choice to the Super Bowl instead of him.
TUBBS: He did volunteer one time.
TRUDY: ( entering ) For a massage parlor bust? ( beat ) Why am I here.?
TUBBS: ( low ) .to backup Switek. But only if it gets lethal.
TRUDY: That's impossible.
TUBBS: Because you cannot kill him.
TRUDY: Because you cannot kill him.
SWITEK: all white bling, is arguing with his blade-thin, glassy-eyed, adrenaline junkie partner, ZITO. Approaching is "Miss Ukraine." High cheekbones suggest one of Genghis Khan's horsemen found her maternal ancestor as attractive as Switek finds her. Tubbs clocks three beefy Russians in a corner, one is unusually fit.
TUBBS: And there's Dmitri.
CROCKETT: The honey trap. And there's the Hello, Miss Ukraine.
TUBBS: Hello, Miss Ukraine.
TRUDY: ( to Crockett ) Eleven to seven he blows it.
CROCKETT: ( whispers ) Twenty on my man.
TRUDY: You're giving away your money,
TUBBS: ( to Zito ) You bet your partner?
ZITO: Sure. Switek versus primal impulse from the amygdala. Higher thinking versus the lizard brain. Tectonic plates of libido confront the Oh, bullshit. She cops his joint. He pushes the button.
GINA: Oh, bullshit. She cops his joint. He pushes the button.
TRUDY: What's so fucking difficult?
CROCKETT: STEVENS ( O.S. ) STEVENS ( O.S. )
CROCKETT: STEVENS ( O.S. )
CROCKETT: On the phone.
CROCKETT: Who is this?
INTERCUT: INT. BENTLEY - ALONZO STEVENS - NIGHT He's cruising at 85. He's floating in a magnolia leather interior. But it's bloodstained from his nose and mouth. He's been beaten. His white shirt is torn. He doesn't
STEVENS: ( voice cracks ) It's fucked up. I'm sorry.
CROCKETT: ( recognizing him ) ( beat ) What are you talking about? Where are you.?
STEVENS: They had me from the gate.
CROCKETT: I don't understand. I gave up nothing on you guys. Don't worry. I kept you and Rico out of it. Only the Feds. They're on their own.it's all their deal, anyway, so fuck 'em.
STEVENS: I gave up nothing on you guys. Don't worry. I kept you and Rico out of it. Only the Feds. They're on their own.it's all their deal, anyway, so fuck 'em.
STEVENS: After I check on Francine and the boys, then I'm gone. Sonny, tell Rico I'm so sorry. I wanted you to
CROCKETT: Where are you?
CROCKETT: STEVENS ( O.S. )
TUBBS: What is it?
CROCKETT: ( nods ) Something's wrong.
TUBBS: ( nods ) Something's wrong.
CROCKETT: ( nods ) Something's wrong.
TUBBS: ( dialing ) I'll try Francine.
MACHINE VOICE: ( recording ) Federal Bureau of Investigation. Our office hours are. ( Crockett punches three-
CROCKETT: ( cuts him off ) This is Detective Crockett. Miami- Dade P.D. Patch me through to your Special Agent in Charge, James Fujima? It's an emergency.
FBI AGENT: He'll be in on Monday.
CROCKETT: I said, "emergency." If he's not reachable, who's running the weekend? The ASAC?
FBI AGENT: We don't give that out.
CROCKETT: Listen carefully. An informant who is working one of YOUR cases right now called me. YOU may have a problem. So get me somebody on the other end of this telephone who knows what the hell I'm talking about.! Miami-Dade PD Tech.
TUBBS: ( into phone ) Miami-Dade PD Tech.
TUBBS: ( into phone ) Bobby G. The firefly we used to have on Alonzo Stevens' Bentley, check if it still runs; if so, launch Air Support. Locate the ( pause, listens ) I don't know.we haven't worked with him for six months.
CROCKETT: ( waits, then hears a click This is Agent James Fujima.
CROCKETT: Detective Crockett.
CROCKETT: 4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.
CROCKETT: A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force. Name of Alonzo Stevens. Now, he's YOUR informant. Stevens, called us. I haven't spoken to him for six I do not know what case you have him on. I do not know what he is talking about. But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad. Right now.
FUJIMA: How do I discuss operations over an open line?
CROCKETT: How do I know? I got the call from Alonzo on an open line. That is the hand we have been dealt at this moment, at eleven-forty-seven o'clock Friday night. Okay? I am trying to alert you, here. You know whether or not.you have a thing goin' down. I do not. But we know this guy. I think you know this guy. Normally, he is cool. Tonight he is distraught. That is atypical. That engenders foreboding. Do you understand the meaning of the word "foreboding"? As in badness is happening to your deal right fucking now?
FUJIMA: Guy's involved in a "meet".
CROCKETT: "Buy and walk"? "Buy and bust"? "Reverse undercover"? What?
FUJIMA: Meet and greet. "I flash you some of mine, you flash me some of And the deal goes down at another place at another time.
CROCKETT: And the deal goes down at another place at another time.
FUJIMA: That's right.
CROCKETT: .so there's no industrial- strength HRT weapons team out there
FUJIMA: Correct. Flash samples. Flash Haitian, Dominican, Russian, White supremacist types.
TUBBS: ( into phone ) Haitian, Dominican, Russian, White supremacist types.
FUJIMA: White supremacist types.
CROCKETT: OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs?
FUJIMA: NLR, we think. I wanna know.
TUBBS: ( sarcastic ) Oh, good.
FUJIMA: .what else, what else did he indicate to you? I need to know everything he said.
CROCKETT: He is saying they had him from the gate. He is saying to my partner and I and to his family "goodbye." What does that tell you?
SWITEK: ( keys radio; too much Sonny, we got him.
RUSSIAN #1: .sample now is okay. And we want sample load when we do deal.
ARYAN BROTHER: Sure, man.
RUSSIAN #1: What inventory you can supply.?
RUSSIAN: Never seen money before? This is called "money."
ARYAN BROTHER: Hey, Ivan! I forgot to ask you something, my brother. .they have a decent death-benefit program in the FBI?
WIDE: The three Aryan Brothers approach the steaming cars with the chopped-up occupants and take the gym bag full of cash. The Escalade driver dons night-vision goggles. They load up and drive off as we hear the "thump, thump" of Air Support and some distant sirens. Meanwhile.
ALONZO STEVENS: exits the Bentley and walks toward Crockett and Tubbs. He holds his hand out to keep them at a distance. Freeway traffic roars past. Crockett and Tubbs don't get too close, heeding Alonzo's warning.
TUBBS: ( incensed, over traffic What the hell did you do?
STEVENS: The Feeb gig was I front a coupla undercover, Russian-speakers to them. One's ATF. And broker the deal. Set up the meet with the NLR
CROCKETT: How'd they get onto you?
STEVENS: How do I know? But it was from the get-go. Knew the FBI had run me into them. Sonny, I gotta go.!
TRUDY: ( after changing channel ) Hello, Sonny.?
STEVENS: ( to Tubbs ) I gotta, I gotta go.!
TUBBS: ( voice cracks ) Alonzo, you don't need to go home.
STEVENS: ( voice cracks ) Alonzo, you don't need to go home.
TUBBS: ( voice cracks ) Alonzo, you don't need to go home.
STEVENS: They said they wouldn't hurt them, wouldn't hurt them if.
TUBBS: They lied.
CROCKETT: They been known to do that.
TUBBS: CASTILLO ( V.O. )
TUBBS: Quarter mile away. We see the Turn around.
TUBBS: ( taking cell ) We know these people.!
CASTILLO: Grieve elsewhere.
FUJIMA: We're not certain.
CASTILLO: You said Nazi Low-riders.?
FUJIMA: We're not certain!
TUBBS: C'mon, man!
FUJIMA: We think NLR. We don't know! Alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet. He wasn't deep into the crew.
CROCKETT: White gangs.? It doesn't track.
TUBBS: White gangs is tweakers and a crystal meth lab in a trailer park. Bounce around the old lady Saturday night and get your recidivist ass busted back.
FUJIMA: Not anymore. This is a distribution network out of South Florida, moving poly-drug loads, crystal meth through coke, to Nashville, Atlanta, Memphis, Cleveland. And computer fraud, identity theft. It's like that.
CASTILLO: ( to the point ) Tell them what you want.
FUJIMA: They knew about Alonzo, before he made a move on them. They had our operation. They've cut into us.
CROCKETT: We don't know.
FUJIMA: We don't know.
TUBBS: Break your encryption? Hack your e- mail? Employee databases? Somebody on the inside?
FUJIMA: We don't know. And that's the point. Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster. And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force. I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it. So the penetration could be from any one agency. What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is As in, your ass is dead in the But Miami PD wasn't part of the J.I.T. And from what Alonzo said, he didn't give you up.
TUBBS: As in, your ass is dead in the But Miami PD wasn't part of the J.I.T. And from what Alonzo said, he didn't give you up.
FUJIMA: But Miami PD wasn't part of the J.I.T. And from what Alonzo said, he didn't give you up.
CROCKETT: So what do you want?
FUJIMA: To recruit you. .I didn't want you around the crime scene because it's crawling with federal law enforcement. We don't know who's straight up, who's Recruit us to do what?
CASTILLO: .I didn't want you around the crime scene because it's crawling with federal law enforcement. We don't know who's straight up, who's Recruit us to do what?
CROCKETT: Recruit us to do what?
FUJIMA: Get into business with this crew, identify them. Illuminate their network. If you're lucky, discover their source, how they penetrated us. We'll indict and take it from How do we do that? Make a buy? That went well.
CROCKETT: How do we do that? Make a buy? That went well.
TUBBS: Reverse undercover? WE supply to They got a steady stream of supply. So, no.
FUJIMA: They got a steady stream of supply. So, no.
CROCKETT: From whom.?
FUJIMA: A Colombian producer. Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.
CROCKETT: Never heard of him.
FUJIMA: From the North Valle area. New. Low-level, we think.
TUBBS: Aryan brothers are not going to change-up suppliers. So.
CROCKETT: Transpo? How they bringing the loads in.?
FUJIMA: They're not. They collect in Miami. Montoya, the producer, handles deliveries. That's his end, and he varies the routes. We got some FLIR off an AWAC of a coupla go-fast boats, on one run, that's all.
TUBBS: Track with me, here. They knew the "Russians" were undercover Feeb? They should have no-showed. But, no, these guys show anyway, and commit murder upon federal officers. And steal all your money. What does that say to you?
CROCKETT: ( speculating ) It says, "We do not fear you." ( to Fujima ) It says, "Fuck off and die." It says, "We get down for Blow that up.
TUBBS: ( to Crockett ) We could try to run loads into these guys. ( to Fujima ) Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida. Into this group.
CROCKETT: We could try to run loads into these guys. Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida. Into this group.
FUJIMA: You need to consider a few issues.
CASTILLO: ( to Crockett + Tubbs ) .you'd be operating outside territorial United States. Your badges do not count. You have no authorization to carry weapons. If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated. And there's no backup. ( to Fujima ) And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya.
FUJIMA: I mean full disclosure.
CASTILLO: I mean full disclosure.
FUJIMA: Of course. From my side, I don't WANT to know anything about what you're doing or how you do it. So let me know if we're on.
CASTILLO: ( to Tubbs ) About the Stevens family, I'm sorry. I know you were close to I was the kids' godfather.
TUBBS: I was the kids' godfather.
CASTILLO: ( intuits ) "And" what?
TUBBS: "And" what?
CASTILLO: I got to know. There is never any room for "personal".
CROCKETT: ( for Tubbs ) He is fine. And we know the jokes. When it gets vengeful, things get messy. When they get messy the wrong people die. ( beat ) Everybody gets it.
CASTILLO: And the answer is "yes." Before she met Alonzo, once upon a time, a long time ago. You bet it was personal.
TUBBS: And the answer is "yes." Before she met Alonzo, once upon a time, a long time ago. You bet it was personal.
CASTILLO: ( to Crockett ) What'd you spot.?
CROCKETT: Three wakes off the back of those boats. Who runs three Sterling engines off a deep-V hull?
TUBBS: Sal Maguda.
CASTILLO: He any good?
TUBBS: Oh, yeah.
CASTILLO: So what's gonna persuade Montoya to change off Sal Maguda running his
BASTIDE: Odile, she say they're pregnant.
TUBBS: Yeah? Okay. Only Jean-Louis and I do the talking.
GUARDS: react, but Crockett draws down on one with an AK-47. Bastide wounds the second GUARD who had drawn down his H & K. A Third Guard begs to live in French Patois. They own the place. And Crockett sees. 800 individually-wrapped bricks of North Valle Colombian cocaine are on a table.
TUBBS: Comme on dit. ( Like they said. )
BAD GUY: You crazy? Que fais-tu?
TUBBS: Que faisons-nous? De qu'a-t-il l'air, fou! Nous voulons tous votre drugs. ( What are we doing? What's it look like we're doing, fool? We are stealing all your dope. )
CROCKETT: tosses two Willie Peters ( white phosphorus grenades ) into the boats. Tubbs fires the M-40 at a third boat, which explodes flame, followed by.
BRILLIANT DAYLIGHT: drive. Crockett reaches into a paper bag full of cell phones and grabs one. He dials up a number, grabs another and hands it to Tubbs.
CROCKETT: ( in the phone ) Hey, Sailor. ( pause ) Yeah, I'm good. ( beat ) Got a hole in the calendar.looking to charge up the cash flow. ( waits ) Yeah, later.
TUBBS: ( into phone ) Hey, Nicholas, my ace. Wha's up?
TUBBS: ( into phone ) We got idle all of an instant. You got something from somewhere that's got to go someplace, somewhen, which is not too distantly in the
NICHOLAS: It is fortuitous that you called.
CROCKETT: We're from Nicholas to meet José.
JOSÉ YERO: ( extends hand ) Sonny Burnett.this is my partner,
CROCKETT: Sonny Burnett.this is my partner,
JOSÉ YERO: As Crockett sits, he notices that at a table a few to the side is a woman. This is ISABELLA. Behind glasses, she seems immobile, filled with intelligence, well-dressed in subdued Tom Ford and staring at him. Reading him. Crockett holds the look that extra beat and turns back to business.
CROCKETT: ( to Security ) Dos café.
TUBBS: So lay it out, my brother.
JOSÉ YERO: Nicholas said you okay. That's nice. But how I know if you any Who you run loads for? Cause other than Nicholas, you knows you?
CROCKETT: JOSÉ YERO
JOSÉ YERO: Who you run loads for? Cause other than Nicholas, you knows you?
CROCKETT: ( dark ) My mommy and daddy know me.
TUBBS: And we didn't come down here to audition. Business auditions for .and know who we are and know they want their load run by us before Nicholas calls.
CROCKETT: That way we do not waste AvGas or our motherfucking time.
TUBBS: You wearing a wire?
CROCKETT: Or DEA? The Feeb? People gonna walk into this place and say, "Ola, hijo! That some crazy wallpaper. Whew.it wild! Is that a Jackson Pollack?"
TUBBS: People gonna walk into this place and say, "Ola, hijo! That some crazy wallpaper. Whew.it wild! Is that a Jackson Pollack?"
CROCKETT: "No, viejo. That was José Yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall."
TUBBS: So we can close each other's eyes right now. Real easy. Real fast. But, then, nobody makes any Slow and low, Adam A-500s. .carbon composite, stealthy, 1400 nautical-mile range, thousand ki payload.all the way to Caravels and 727's from a source country to a transshipment point.

CROCKETT: And specialize in very fast go-fast boats for coastal runs.
TUBBS: What kind of weight?
JOSÉ YERO: We don't talk weight. We talk You get longs and lats for the pickup. Open ocean. You run it in. On shore, our people receive the loads.
CROCKETT: ( interrupts ) The people on shore who handle a load we run are our people, not your people. No tweakers, dopers, first- timers we don't know. They didn't do time with us, they ain't doing crime with us.
TUBBS: What you get from us is a date. A place. "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami." At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there. Keys in the ignition. Ready to roll. You pick it up. And you drive it. Money thing is done in advance in places where there are no guns. Because when money and guns get together, there is violence.
CROCKETT: Money thing is done in advance in places where there are no guns. Because when money and guns get together, there is violence.
JOSÉ YERO: You afraid of violence?
CROCKETT: I am not John Wayne. There is no "S" on his chest. We get down if the play calls for it. But we are into business and making money.
TUBBS: And violence is extra. And expensive. So how much weight you looking to move?
JOSÉ YERO: Nothing. 'Cause how you do delivery on the beach, I don't like. Maybe this does not work.
CROCKETT: Then it don't work.
TUBBS: What happened to the last transporter you had?
JOSÉ YERO: What do you care?
TUBBS: ( to Crockett ) Do we need this.?
CROCKETT: ( rises ) Red light, green light, José?
JOSÉ YERO: ( doesn't answer, leans I'm also called "Cochi Loco." That means "Crazy pig." 'Cause I enforce security and get people to tell me what I need to know. That part of what I do, you never want to find out about. ( pause ) Other people will negotiate the money and go or not go. Not me.
TUBBS: Then what were we talking to you I had to lay eyes on you.
JOSÉ YERO: I had to lay eyes on you.
CROCKETT: Isabella watches Crockett.
JOSÉ YERO: ( to Tubbs ) You seem okay. ( to Tubbs re: Crockett ) But him? I don't like. how he
TUBBS: What do I care what you think about how he looks? You wanna fuck my partner or do business?
JOSÉ YERO: Wait by the phone. You get a call. Or maybe you don't. Until then, piss off back to where you come from.
TUBBS: .Sonny can wait.
TUBBS: Gina enters in a robe.
CROCKETT: Gina enters in a robe.
GINA: ( beat ) "Hi, Gina. Hi, Sonny."
CROCKETT: Hi, Gina. This is from Frick and Frack. What do we got?
TUBBS: ( re: bag ) What do we got?
CROCKETT: Satellite. New encryption. Supposedly sharper than the G. How good's our background?
GINA: You're so not the PD, if you got busted on a DUI, you're in serious trouble.you're bad men back to grammar school. San Quentin. Pelican Bay. Marine Corps. Statesville. Pelican Bay, where you guys hooked up. Now you're too smart and too fast to get jacked again.
CROCKETT: How will it stand up?
GINA: If they ran the rental car or lease on this place.even if it's EPIC database in El Paso.they'd have to work through the layers of bullshit three weeks deep. Then they'd find your deeper, hidden criminal selves.
GINA: ( Lazily ) What am I supposed to do after I get my nails and hair done.?
TUBBS: Reality TV and stay by the phone. That's what all wives-in-crime
GINA: Be.careful. You hear me?
TUBBS: Where we meeting 'em.?
CROCKETT: EXT. PORT-AU-PRINCE AIRPORT, RUNWAY - LEAR JET - DAWN touches down, drives towards us. Turns towards commercial aviation facility.
CROCKETT: What do we got?
TUBBS: Five minutes.
CROCKETT: "traps" the room to reveal if it had been searched while they were gone. He aligns the suitcase perfectly parallel on the bench. A matchstick goes against the closed closet door. A ballpoint pen is leaned against the telephone. From his bag Tubbs pulls a Smith & Wesson J-frame hammerless in .357 Magnum. He holsters this on his ankle. A Remington 780 shotgun with pistol grip, sawed-off to a 12-inch barrel gets slung on a bungee-cord shoulder strap under his right arm. .9mm under his shirt in his waistband and two spare magazines clipped to his belt.
CROCKETT: loads a .45 "race" gun with rounded sights and a magna-ported barrel, cross-drawn, and a blunt .45 Para-Ordnance in the small of his back. They're ready.
DISSOLVE: EXT. PORT-AU-PRINCE CEMETERY ( HAITI ) - CROCKETT + TUBBS - LATE AFTERNOON wait. Shadows on white limestone monuments. Bird songs.
LATE AFTERNOON: wait. Shadows on white limestone monuments. Bird songs.
DISSOLVE: WHITE MAUSOLEUMS - DUSK They wait. And wait. And nothing happens.
TUBBS: They watching us watching them watching us waiting for them? Or Who knows. That's it.
CROCKETT: Who knows. That's it.
TUBBS: That's it.
TWILIGHT: approach their door. Crockett stops. The tape "trap" is torn. Weapons appear in their hands. Someone's been here.
DOORS CRASH: in. HAITIAN PARAMILITARY in soccer jerseys and shorts with assault rifles.
CROCKETT: Really? So, what is this, a party?
TUBBS: We'll have room service wipe up the furniture.and bring drinks.
CROCKETT: Glad we came. This place is a lot of fun if you're Doctors Without Borders. So.?
ISABELLA: I run down the numbers. Nothing is very negotiable. Small loads? We pay three thousand a ki. We pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent. The next ten percent on U.S. landfall.
TUBBS: Define small.
ISABELLA: Two, three thousand a ki. Two thousand ki's, your end is
CROCKETT: I thought we had to meet the Man.
ISABELLA: You do.
CROCKETT: Right now.
ISABELLA: Right now.
CROCKETT: has seen something else. He indicates the pager on his TUBBS' POV: PAGER - NO SIGNAL That's what's surprising. Tubbs pulls his cell phone. Meanwhile, they're slowing down for the police roadblock. Crockett gets tense.
TUBBS: watches. His cell's SIGNAL STRENGTH INDICATOR steps down to EXT. POLICE ROADBLOCK - COPS stop the caravan. Is this turning bad?
CROCKETT: eyes his pager; Tubbs his cell phone: no signal in an urban area? Blocking signal traffic is something the CIA does over Baghdad. It's not supposed to be happening in Haiti on a dope deal.
CROCKETT: gestures to Tubbs to look up. They see.
TUBBS: checks out the first Suburban's uplink satellite dish on a hydraulic mast. The rear's converted into computer equipment sitting in ruggedized racks.
MONTOYA: Please take that seat on the Thank you.
TUBBS: Thank you.
MONTOYA: ( polite, friendly ) Excuse me because I am very busy and have many things to do, so this will be brief. Yes? ( beat; not waiting ) We will try you on a "run." One. To build trust. We do a thousand kis. In all matters, when you work for us, you must do exactly what you say you will do. ( beat ) In this business with me, if you say you will do a thing, you must do exactly that thing. ( beat ) Then? You will prosper beyond your dreams and you can live in Miami in millionaire style. ( beat ) If you are arrested, there will be lawyers made available to you in the United States. You will use them. Anything you need, you will be provided by me. It cost you nothing. You will contact and work through José Yero on logistics and communications. To do with money, you will work through my wife, More than I, in finance and business, she is very dangerous. I look forward to our doing work together. Whether we do or not, it is unlikely we will meet again. So I extend my best wishes to your ( to Tubbs ) Particularly to your beautiful ( beat ) Thank you for making this long trip to see me.
CROCKETT: in the town square, now, too. But Isabella stayed inside Montoya's Suburban. Now, she lowers her window.
ROADBLOCKS: break up. Montoya's Suburbans pull out. The security cordon deforms. It all disappears around them. It leaves only the Mercedes, a driver, and Crockett and Tubbs.
CROCKETT: holds that look.
CROCKETT: Sound deadens. His attention is on the woman in the mirror.until it's broken by Tubbs' attention to his cell TUBBS' CELL PHONE Signal strength returns. Tubbs punches in numbers.
TUBBS: ( low ) .who did we just meet?
TUBBS: You okay?
GINA: You sure?
TUBBS: You sure?
GINA: Yes. What's up?
TUBBS: Nothing. Calling to say hi. What's up with you?
GINA: To Tubbs, that's good news.
TUBBS: Okay.see you soon.
GINA: .and thanks for the flowers.
TUBBS: What flowers?
GINA: The bouquet, here. Five-hundred dollars worth of roses.yellow. There a note? You mean with the flowers.?
TUBBS: There a note? You mean with the flowers.?
GINA: You mean with the flowers.?
TUBBS: What's it say?
GINA: "Salutations from the south." I.I thought it was from you.
TUBBS: We're on our way.
GINA: ( cool ) Good idea. ( beat ) We'll grab a bite.
TUBBS: Good idea. We'll grab a bite.
GINA: .the lease, the phones, the cars.layers of false ident. Would take the FBI weeks. How long did it take them? Three hours? This means, "We can reach out and touch somebody." Like Bad .even if they could run the identities you built to EPIC, all they'll find is more cover. Trust what you built. It's quality, girl. We're cool.
TUBBS: ( cuts in ) .even if they could run the identities you built to EPIC, all they'll find is more cover. Trust what you built. It's quality, girl. We're cool.
GINA: ( leans in; holds his hand .you are trying to reassure me because you know when people get anxious, they make mistakes. You're worried about me. Do not ( into his eyes ) I am careful. I am cool. I got Trudy, backup, whatever. You worry about you. Because you are the ones who are in denied territory, not me. If your focus is on me, you'll miss something coming at you. That's how people slip up. Get hurt. And I'd die if anything happened. You worry about you. You and Sonny.are in the dangerous place. I'm fine. ( loud ) Fuck 'em. They sent us some flowers. Big deal. Thanks for the
CROCKETT: We set.
TUBBS: To the limit.
CROCKETT: You worried about the tree line, US Customs AWACS, or something else on your mind?
TUBBS: Gina in the Miami pad. You gonna give me phony denials?
CROCKETT: Gina in the Miami pad. You gonna give me phony denials?
TUBBS: ( beat ) You gonna give me phony Good. So let's go.
CROCKETT: Good. So let's go.
TUBBS: Good. So let's go.
ZITO: Negative, Opa-Locka.
RADAR OFFICER: Let me see.
CROCKETT: Neptune gonna show?
CROCKETT: ( skeptical ) Usually his thing is street dealers. Torture their families until they cough up the stash. He's ambitious.
TUBBS: Heads up.
ESCALADE: Lights off. Cruises through the parking lot past the U-Haul- It to the other side and disappears.
CROCKETT: Here's another incognito genius.
NEPTUNE: pops the lock on the U-Haul-It with a crowbar. He rolls up the door expecting millions worth of cocaine. Instead he comes face to face with the barrel of a 12-gauge.
TRUDY: April Fool, motherfucker.
TUBBS: ( Patois ) Arrete! Arrete! Freeze! ( to one ) Et vous, mo-fo!
NEPTUNE: is rolled over by Crockett. He plastic-ties his wrists and feet. Others are manhandled.
CROCKETT: "Extras" tried to relieve us of your weight. And by the by, you know of a player in Overtown who goes by the name of "Things Aquatic"?
JOSÉ YERO: I do. We don't do business with He tried to."do business".with you. Around ten. His place. Be I'll be there.
CROCKETT: He tried to."do business".with you. Around ten. His place. Be I'll be there.
JOSÉ YERO: I'll be there.
CROCKETT: Look familiar?
DOPE: Carefully stacked in the living room are the PLASTIC-WRAPPED
TUBBS: This the load you lost a while It is. He try to take tonight's And what do I do with him?
JOSÉ YERO: It is. He try to take tonight's And what do I do with him?
CROCKETT: JOSÉ YERO
JOSÉ YERO: And what do I do with him?
TUBBS: ( shrugs ) Whatever you want. Like we said, we're not into violence.
JOSÉ YERO: ( suspicious ) I walk into Neptune's house.very nice. But I also see you. and our drugs that got ripped from You don't like us finding your load? We can go and lose it all over again.
TUBBS: You don't like us finding your load? We can go and lose it all over again.
CROCKETT: How 'bout this? How'd Neptune know where to hit us? Huh? Whose Op sec's got a leak? Yours?
JOSÉ YERO: What'd Neptune tell you?
CROCKETT: He didn't. Interrogation's not in our skill set. So c'mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these Here's what this is.ask how much they want to turn back to us our
JOSÉ YERO: ( whispers in Spanish to Here's what this is.ask how much they want to turn back to us our
ISABELLA: We want it back.
CROCKETT: What's the recovery? How much are you looking for?
ISABELLA: What's the recovery? How much are you looking for?
TUBBS: ( to Crockett ) How much we looking for?
CROCKETT: What's "nothing"?
ISABELLA: What's "nothing"?
CROCKETT: Nothing. As in "free, gratis."
TUBBS: And as an investment in the "Future" of.?
ISABELLA: ( takes off her glasses and "Future" of.?
CROCKETT: A fine.business.relationship.
TUBBS: It's yours cause what's yours, is yours. And what's ours is ours. .like the second ten-percent, which is now due, Yero, my ace. What's up next? Or is this a one- time deal?
ISABELLA: ( to Yero ) Give them the shipment on the
TUBBS: Maritime. Jose will fill you in.
ISABELLA: Maritime. Jose will fill you in.
TUBBS: ( to Yero ) Lay it out.
CROCKETT: ( low ) There is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product.
ISABELLA: ( low ) And what is that? Let me buy you a drink.
CROCKETT: Let me buy you a drink.
ISABELLA: ( low ) What do you like to drink?
CROCKETT: ( low ) I'm a fiend for mojitas.
ISABELLA: ( low ) How fast does that go?
CROCKETT: It goes very fast.
ISABELLA: Show me.? Can I talk to you for a second, Wha's up.?
TUBBS: Can I talk to you for a second, Wha's up.?
CROCKETT: ( low ) I know what I'm doing.
TUBBS: .secure satellite comms. encrypted e-mail, the longs and lats for the transshipment point.all that? It's all cool. But I need a vector, not a location. 'Cause ships move. That's why they call them ships. Ship stops? It's trying to be an apartment building. At sea that attracts attention. That's bad.
ISABELLA: The wind whips her hair behind her, now. The two are small against the smooth 50' long hull. Crockett hands her wraparound shades for her eyes. She doesn't want them.
CROCKETT: ( through headset ) So where's the best place for Bodeguita del Medio. It's the only place for mojitas.
ISABELLA: Bodeguita del Medio. It's the only place for mojitas.
CROCKETT: Where's that?
ISABELLA: Off a little alley with cobblestones. Hemingway went The Keys?
CROCKETT: The Keys?
ISABELLA: Havana? Cubans don't like us or my Are you afraid? Good. And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.
CROCKETT: Havana? Cubans don't like us or my Are you afraid? Good. And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.
ISABELLA: Are you afraid? Good. And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.
CROCKETT: waves her over to join him behind the wheel. He holds out his left hand to steady her. He brings her to him. Both lean against his high upholstered chair. He holds her to his side. Indicates the wheel.
CROCKETT: Light touch. Everything comes to you through the wheel.
CROCKETT: stays on the throttle, throttling back when the props are out of the water so you don't redline the engine and forward when reentering. The swells are now four feet. They launch off each, get airborne, cut into the next.
ISABELLA: My cousin is the harbor master. You must not bring in drugs. You cannot be armed. If you're carrying, it has to go. Or stow it inside. No one will go near your You do business in Cuba with your I never do business in Cuba. And nobody goes to Cuba but me. And he is not my husband.
CROCKETT: You do business in Cuba with your I never do business in Cuba. And nobody goes to Cuba but me. And he is not my husband.
ISABELLA: I never do business in Cuba. And nobody goes to Cuba but me. And he is not my husband.
CROCKETT: Were you born in Havana?
ISABELLA: Angola. My mother was being a surgeon there. She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too. .those days, in those days.she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world. She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado.we still have the house. We will go there.
CROCKETT: Where's she now?
ISABELLA: She's dead.
CROCKETT: Your father?
ISABELLA: Angolan Military. Went back to the fighting. Disappeared. Who Go ahead and ask.
CROCKETT: How's he not your husband?
ISABELLA: I am no one's wife. I live in my own house. I do not live in a man's house. He has a wife. We are together. I am free. Because of banking and finance and travel. And I can do anything I want.
CROCKETT: can't help it. He looks right at her. She lifts her face to the spray. Some clouds part and light strikes her. And Crockett wants to possess her; to protect her. He wants no one else to have her. He wants no harm to come to her. And this is an impulse that takes him over to the core of who he is. And, as we MOVE IN CLOSER, Crockett has to turn sees this. She's quizzical. Crockett looks back at her. Their eyes connect.
ISABELLA: sees this. She's quizzical. Crockett looks back at her. Their eyes connect.
CROCKETT: his left arm around her shoulder, his right on the wheel. She rocks back against his body. They rip across the seas.
CROCKETT: ( shouts over noise ) ( shouting back ) Later! Do you dance?
ISABELLA: ( shouting back ) Later! Do you dance?
CROCKETT: I dance.
CROCKETT: hears voices from the interior.
ISABELLA: My aunt. She's ancient. She looks after the place. This was my mother's family's
ISABELLA: Tell me everything.
CROCKETT: I insist.
ISABELLA: I insist.
CROCKETT: ( flip ) ( beat ) Macon, Georgia is where I was born. Wound up in a juvenile facility. I was 14. Then the military. Then prison. Because I was dumb and angry. Then I read. Then I got smart. Then I discovered what I know, now.it's all business. ( to Bartender ) My friend, two more. ( beat ) What was your mother's name.?
ISABELLA: Blanca.a rubio like you. I see her in a dress.an old photograph from Lucinda somebody's wedding.everybody is with couples. Husbands and wives. They all pose. My mother is alone because my father had to go back to the fighting. .she looks right into the camera. She is the most beautiful woman in the room. By herself. In a party dress. And she looked like she knew she would die alone. She spoke many languages. We were in Luanda when she died. I went to her friends in Mali. They sent me to the Ecole Polytechnique in Geneva to study mathematics, where I met Montoya in the discos. He had banking there.I was seventeen and very much into the clubs. And he sent me to University for an MBA in Finance. Your mother?
CROCKETT: Died in childbirth, having me.
ISABELLA: To mothers. And all that we owe You know how improbable this is.?
CROCKETT: You know how improbable this is.?
ISABELLA: "Probable".applies to an event that may be real. Doesn't apply .'cause we have no future.are of today and not tomorrow.
CROCKETT: .'cause we have no future.are of today and not tomorrow.
ISABELLA: ( laughs ) That's right.
CROCKETT: .and therafore there is no
ISABELLA: Crockett's hand is around her waist and slips down her hip as he pulls her closer and takes off her glasses and she puts down her drink and kisses him at the bar and Crockett's eyes dwell on her and she looks back at him and, now, knowing what he's thinking.
AFTERNOON: The water is like sheet metal as clouds allow only a sliver of light to illuminate the sea while rain greys-out most of it. Minute crimson is a freighter heading to the stone harbor. Fabric billows in the wind. PULL BACK into the room to Crockett and Isabella.
ISABELLA: enters. She touches his back. He turns to her with a smile.
CROCKETT: ( soft ) Let's talk deliveries. .and a different kind of deal.
ISABELLA: Like "three thousand a ki?" That's And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx. But, three per ki was OK for openers.
CROCKETT: Like "three thousand a ki?" That's And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx. But, three per ki was OK for openers.
ISABELLA: And why should continuing excellence cost more?
CROCKETT: Cost less. That's the point.
ISABELLA: Is it December?
CROCKETT: What do you mean?
ISABELLA: Did Christmas come early this Better than that. We become partners. Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki. You pay us zero. Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash. "And why," you're thinking, "would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping? Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?" And the answer is, "of course" but also "no. It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can."
CROCKETT: Better than that. We become partners. Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki. You pay us zero. Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash. "And why," you're thinking, "would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping? Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?" And the answer is, "of course" but also "no. It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can."
ISABELLA: Good samba dancing.?
CROCKETT: Zero risk.
ISABELLA: 'Cause you don't lose loads?
CROCKETT: 'Cause we guarantee every load. Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good. Your operations will, from now on, run And you're our thirty-percent What if I tell you that your ideas are too big for your skin? That merely to propose this is a dangerous thing?
ISABELLA: And you're our thirty-percent What if I tell you that your ideas are too big for your skin? That merely to propose this is a dangerous thing?
CROCKETT: Then I would say to you, this has been fun.
ISABELLA: The range should be between fifteen and seventeen-point-five percent of the P.O.E..to even consider it.
CROCKETT: I need thirty. Calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front.
ISABELLA: Available cash is not an issue for What if I pushed to twenty-one.?
CROCKETT: What if I pushed to twenty-one.?
ISABELLA: What if I pushed to twenty-one.?
CROCKETT: I would say you're. .four percentage points away from a deal.
ISABELLA: Maybe I'm only one.
CROCKETT: We'll do it at twenty-two. .and now what?
ISABELLA: And now I make you breakfast
CROCKETT: Rain and wind rip across his face. He left Isabella in SATELLITE PHONE rings. Crockett picks it up. It's Tubbs.
SATELLITE PHONE: rings. Crockett picks it up. It's Tubbs.
CROCKETT: ( into phone ) On my way back.
TUBBS: ( mutters ) The meet with Castillo and the fed got set up. It's in 45 minutes.
GINA: What's up, Sonny.?
TUBBS: Where'd you go?
CROCKETT: Hit a couple of jazz clubs. Fell back to her place.
TUBBS: Verdado where?
CROCKETT: Verdado where?
TUBBS: Verdado where?
CROCKETT: It's in the suburbs outside Havana.
TUBBS: Havana, Cuba.?
CROCKETT: No. Havana, Louisiana. Don't we have a meet?
TUBBS: .where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus You're not makin' a move on her.?
CROCKETT: You're not makin' a move on her.?
TUBBS: You're not makin' a move on her.?
CROCKETT: We're makin' moves on each other.
TUBBS: Oh, that makes it okay, then.
FUJIMA: Who said, "go exploring"? We want this staying on track.
CROCKETT: ( to Fujima ) Who's the "we"? There's you and there's us. And all we got from you was bad intel. "Low-level producer." Yeah, right.
FUJIMA: What are you talking about?
CROCKETT: Montoya. We went to meet the village priest. It turns into Alice in the fucking Vatican and here's the Pope.of the North Valle Colombia dope trade.
TUBBS: His operations are kingpin size and first-class. His security is ex- Eastern bloc, ex-SAS and Israelis. Their comms are satellite uplink with mainframe encryption, significant Sig Int and in their zones of activity, they have signal- jamming capability.
CROCKETT: Yeah. CIA-level stuff.
TUBBS: And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to Mega-tonnage and mega-cash flow.
CROCKETT: Mega-tonnage and mega-cash flow.
FUJIMA: Out of.?
CROCKETT: Haiti and Puerto Rico. Money through Dubai and Geneva maybe.
TUBBS: Their loads are poly-drug. "E" from Holland, methamphetamine precursors from Jordan, Afghan "H." Mid-ocean transshipments. His real business is: he's a network.
CROCKETT: And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
TUBBS: So we want to change-up the mission Identify and indict the white supremacist group of importers. End of story. Everything else I'm hearing is speculation masquerading as intel. What's this?
FUJIMA: ( no ) Identify and indict the white supremacist group of importers. End of story. Everything else I'm hearing is speculation masquerading as intel. What's this?
CROCKETT: Keys to the boat. Go do this motherfucker yourself.
FUJIMA: Who are you talking to?
TUBBS: He's talking to you, bro. What he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization.
CROCKETT: ( re: Fujima ) Hey, fuck him.
TUBBS: Chill out Sonny.
CROCKETT: We're the ones doing the death- defying shit? And he wants us to give that up? For what? A chump-change bust so he can get his picture in The Miami Herald to impress the slug farm in DC.
FUJIMA: ( to Castillo ) Control your men.
CROCKETT: I'm my own man. And anytime you want to see how much man I am?
CASTILLO: ( low ) That's. It. ( to Tubbs ) Where are you on this?
TUBBS: With Sonny. 110%.
CASTILLO: Then that's it. Change the mission statement. Crockett stays in. He keeps working up the ladder. The local importers get a pass for the time being.
FUJIMA: I don't know.
CASTILLO: Yes you do.
FUJIMA: I got to talk to my ADO.
CASTILLO: No, you don't, Jim. 'Cause if I close this down, you got nothing to make a phone call about. And my guys don't have a week for a Feeb bureaucratic process. Every hour longer they're in there, they risk exposure. So, right here, right now, they're back in or I pull them out and close you down. What's it going to be?
FUJIMA: He leaves. When he's out of earshot.
CASTILLO: ( to Crockett ) You fuckin' better be right.!
TUBBS: ( low ) What is going on.?!
CROCKETT: As in.?
TUBBS: There is "undercover." And there is "Which way is up?"
CROCKETT: You think I am in so deep I forgot?
TUBBS: I am asking. You to me.
CROCKETT: Do you believe.I have forgotten I am a cop?
TUBBS: I would never doubt you. And do you doubt I will slot anyone complicit in the death of Maria, Alonzo and those children? Anyone.whoever they are.
CROCKETT: No, I do not.
LONDONO: in pajama top and boxer shorts, smoking a cigar. In a sweatsuit is Isabella, delivering a financial report. It's from memory. Nothing is written down, in the tradition of the elite section of Swiss private banking in which clerks commit portfolios to memory. There are no documents.
ISABELLA: .and we're looking at Nigerian Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
MONTOYA: Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
ISABELLA: Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
MONTOYA: Not French registry?
ISABELLA: They've been targeted. And Pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now.
MONTOYA: José doesn't like the deal in South
ISABELLA: ( cuts in ) ( shrugs ) They want 22% of the value on loads they run into South Florida. It's the Juarez cartel model. They guarantee the loads. The upside is our risk goes to zero. That frees-up capital.
MONTOYA: But what does your intuition tell My "intuition".? My intuition made him breakfast the other morning in Havana.
ISABELLA: My "intuition".? My intuition made him breakfast the other morning in Havana.
MONTOYA: They're serious. They're cautious. They'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery's handled.they'd walk away, rather than compromise operational security.that's good. But they have to be watched A good deal, like this with us, for Burnett will be good only temporarily. He'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever. Life is dust, make it while you can. He's ambitious. So I predict a few good runs. Then there'll be a renegotiation.

MONTOYA: That's my girl. On the next load, José wants to front them silver. But they them in He thinks they are wrong. What do you think?
ISABELLA: ( revealing nothing ) I think José suspects anybody he doesn't intimidate. And people, who are good at what they do? They have egos, too.
MONTOYA: ( careful ) What would you do.?
ISABELLA: ( equally careful ) I like the diminished risk. It frees up capital reserves. I like working with self-interested businessmen who are competent. You can predict their behavior.. On the other hand.if what you wish, mi corazon, is la plumba.the lead? Then let's do that. Accept their deal. After the load is received.we will close their eyes forever. Let's try a few runs with these partners, I think. I will tell
MONTOYA: Let's try a few runs with these partners, I think. I will tell
CROCKETT: emerges from behind an SUV. He came to meet her plane.
ISABELLA'S: expression changes, but she masks it. Businesslike, she walks across the tarmac. There are two Suburbans. One for her; one full of security. Crockett and her meet. No show of affection. Her Secretary, carrying her briefcase, accompanies her towards the second Suburban.
CROCKETT: Hola, chica.
ISABELLA: Hola, viejo.
NIGHT: deplaning his G-4 crosses to his armored Suburban.
MONTOYA: ( to an Assistant ) Do you have him? José, about the Americans.
INTERCUT: INT. BARRANQUILLA CLUB, OFFICE - JOSÉ YERO Montoya thinks.
JOSÉ YERO: ( in Spanish ) They are "wrong." I do not trust ( in Spanish ) ( in Spanish ) Too good at what they do, I don't know. Something I don't like. They are wrong.
JOSÉ YERO: ( in Spanish ) Too good at what they do, I don't know. Something I don't like. They are wrong.
GINA: sees Crockett's carriage with this woman. It's different. Intuitively, she exchanges a look with Tubbs. Crockett makes introductions. Then, they move away to dance to a fast samba in perfect synchronicity. And, they're also SEEN by.
JOSÉ YERO: He watches them, too. His yellow eyes are lit by strobes. His eyes locked onto Isabella.dancing with Crockett, their bodies close. And in the way he looks at them, hurt, like a betrayed lover, which he isn't and never could have been.we know now, the core of his antagonism.
JOSÉ YERO: Transshipment point is here at 17:00 hours on the 23rd.
TUBBS: Uh-uh. No predetermined places and times to meet. Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal.
JOSÉ YERO: You give yours to me. We position all the assets hauling our loads.
CROCKETT: Now how we do it, blood. It risks signal interception and other bad things like people who don't need to know where we're at knowing.
TUBBS: At ten to three on the 27th, I will satellite page him with a website and encryption code. He will have ten minutes to log on and receive his new heading. Ten minutes and thirty seconds, website disappears and he can drive his fucking boat up to Iceland.
JOSÉ YERO: Malaysian registry. Small Give them their codes and heading.
CROCKETT: JOSÉ YERO
JOSÉ YERO: Fifty-gallon drums. Thirty-two. A hundred kilos in each. You transship that to the Malaysian Importation value? At twenty-two thousand a ki.
TUBBS: Importation value? At twenty-two thousand a ki.
JOSÉ YERO: You work that out with La Senora. You will get sixteen fuel bladders of crystal meth precursors from the Malaysian ship. For collection in North Miami. You warehouse it. Release it when we say. I'm sure you have friends with fast If you see a few new faces, don't get jumpy.
CROCKETT: If you see a few new faces, don't get jumpy.
TUBBS: And José, my ace, lots of transshipment. Lots of action. Skies are crowded. And the JIT has assets on land, air, and sea. So any intel you got that can come our way and contribute to the good and welfare.?
JOSÉ YERO: Sure. Check your e-mail.
TRUDY: returns the look with a stare that says, "Don't fuck with me". José raises his eyebrow and after noting the two handguns holstered in the waistband of her hiphuggers.
JOSÉ YERO: ( to El Tiburon ) You know what Escobar used to do?
EL TIBURON: JOSÉ YERO ( goes on ) ( beat ) ( imitates Pablo ) ( pause ) ( beat ) ( beat )
JOSÉ YERO: ( goes on ) In the '80's, air routes came into favor. It required many pilots. The best were American. Former crop-dusters. They didn't fly by the book. Tell one: "Put that 747 down on this fifteen-hundred-foot runway." Somehow, he'd do it. Great pilots. But Pablo had a rule. After they flew six loads.this good pilot who facilitates so much good business. he would come back to Medellín or Barranquilla to pick up the next load? ( beat ) And no one would ever see him again. He'd disappear. ( imitates Pablo ) "You a good pilot? Make a lot of money for Pablo? Thank you very much." And then Pablo would kill his ass. After six loads. ( pause ) And who was Pablo Escobar? A provincial who got busted-out by the white collars from Cali. When the gringos got him, he was nobody. We're three times better than Pablo ( beat ) The means we kill these sonsabitches three times sooner. ( beat ) And do you know why Pablo Escobar did that?
EL TIBURON: JOSÉ YERO
JOSÉ YERO: He didn't like pilots.
NIGHT: Isabella hands out banana leaves wrapped and tied around cooked rice and barbecued pork. Gina and Tubbs walk away down the beach towards phosphorescent waves.
ISABELLA: I forgot the napkins.
CROCKETT: And the chopsticks and fortune What's the best fortune you ever They're all the same. "Financial security is around the corner." "Your friends love you."
ISABELLA: What's the best fortune you ever They're all the same. "Financial security is around the corner." "Your friends love you."
CROCKETT: They're all the same. "Financial security is around the corner." "Your friends love you."
ISABELLA: In Kowloon, once, I got one that said, "Live now because life is
CROCKETT: Do you have assets somewhere else? Bank accounts?
ISABELLA: .to fall back on. You know, a fail-safe. Insurance.
CROCKETT: .to fall back on. You know, a fail-safe. Insurance.
ISABELLA: Do I need it?
CROCKETT: ( shrugs ) Everybody needs it. Ask Prudential. Or Allstate.
ISABELLA: ( laughs ) 'Cause whatever can go wrong,
CROCKETT: Something like that. The odds catch up with you. The odds are like gravity. You can't negotiate with them. So.at some point, you should cash out, take your money and run.
ISABELLA: ( smiles ) Sure. As far away and as fast as you can.
CROCKETT: Sure. As far away and as fast as you can.
ISABELLA: Whenever. Maybe later, maybe
CROCKETT: Whenever. Maybe later, maybe
ISABELLA: Would you find me.?
CROCKETT: Of course.
ISABELLA: Where would I go?
CROCKETT: Zanzibar. The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands Is this the protective male talk?
ISABELLA: ( smiles ) Is this the protective male talk?
CROCKETT: ( deadly serious ) This is the talk of a man.if he were your husband.he would never put you at risk. He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
ISABELLA: And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you A few more moments, still in this business. Then I'd find you.
CROCKETT: A few more moments, still in this business. Then I'd find you.
ISABELLA: Would you? Because if you couldn't, I would be very lonely. I would have left the only world I know and have known since I was But none of this will happen. So it doesn't matter. Because we are on the Guajira Peninsula. And all you see around you.look around. is Archangel de Jesus Montoya- Londono. He is my man. And you are a smuggler moving a load.
CROCKETT: .in the morning.
ISABELLA: I'll be on board by noon. What did you think? This deal with you is my deal. I am responsible.
CROCKETT: Go ahead.
TRUDY: Too fast. Too many moving parts.
CROCKETT: Zito joins them.
SWITEK: Same. But it's your call, boss.
CROCKETT: What's your take?
TUBBS: What's the point? It's going down.
CROCKETT: Call the US Coast Guard: "Come and arrest our ass." And Switek resumes romancing Miss
TRUDY: If we were for real, and knew our shit, we'd fade this one.
CROCKETT: Then you should.
TRUDY: ( no ) If you're down, we're down for the
PLAID HOUSEDRESS: stares at her from the back corner of the double-wide trailer. With her is an overweight autistic Boy of about 11. He plays in the corner and watches a small TV with a coat hanger for an antenna. The Old Woman pays Gina no attention On her face is zero affect. There are other sounds in the WIDER: GINA and we see she is tied to a chair that is bolted to the floor. Her clothes are disheveled and ripped. She tries to focus. Then somebody's thick arms are fitting something around her neck. A blindfold goes over her eyes. Around her neck is a C-4 "necklace" like the one we saw on Stevens' wife in the beginning of the film. The arms and back belong to the deep- chested Aryan Brother we saw from the Stevens' house and Coleman's double-wide. MOVE IN ON GINA. He reaches below the frame and does something. Gina writhes away from him in the chair. He laughs. He backs away from her to camera.and holds something in his hand.
A CAMERA: He takes a digital picture.
CELL PHONE: in the hands of the deep-chested Aryan Brother. Three girls in cutoffs and halters are making sandwiches and laughing in the b.g.. Then:
ARYAN BROTHER: El Tiburon.
COLEMAN: EL TIBURON ( in Spanish )
EL TIBURON: ( in Spanish ) Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.
COLEMAN: ( perfect Spanish ) All I want to know is the where and the when. Spare me mini moves, progress reports and bullshit.
EL TIBURON: ( in Spanish ) Okay. You got the "item"?
COLEMAN: I got the item.
EL TIBURON: ( in Spanish ) And our friend don't like the rest of the people bringin' the merch to ( in Spanish ) How many?
COLEMAN: ( in Spanish ) How many?
EL TIBURON: ( in Spanish ) Two main players plus three.
COLEMAN: ( in Spanish ) My end?
EL TIBURON: ( in Spanish ) 25% discount on the load.
COLEMAN: ( in Spanish ) Make it 40%.
EL TIBURON: ( in Spanish ) Make it 35.
COLEMAN: Coleman hangs up.
CAPTAIN: ( loud hailer ) Me-a salama. Ila l-liqa.
TUBBS: Yeah. Whatever.
CROCKETT: JOSÉ YERO ( O.S. ) ( phone filter )
CROCKETT: ( into phone ) You got something to say, José, let's hear it.
JOSÉ YERO: I confess I have succumbed to my weaknesses. An inability to see another's point of view. I've discussed it with professionals. Even with one of your friends. She's here now. So I want you to deliver my product, how I want my product
CROCKETT: What friend?
JOSÉ YERO: Mrs. Rico. But don't worry. She is safe. To insure that, I am keeping her close to me. It's always good to keep people your friends care about close to you. So, I will tell you when you're 10 minutes out where to drop the load into the hands of my people. You have 35 minutes to enter Government Channel. Head up the River. We will watch you. Then I will call And you can reach out for La Senora in Barranquilla or wherever 'cause I don't give a shit.
CROCKETT: Proof of life. How do I know Mrs. Rico's alive?
JOSÉ YERO: 'Cause she will tell you.
ISABELLA: That sonofabitch!
TUBBS: ( turns on Isabella ) You set this up!
ISABELLA: ( sarcastic ) Of course! That is why I placed myself here, with you, knowing Yero would pull this crap.
CROCKETT: Yero doesn't know she's here!
SWITEK: ( entering ) Cigarette and the two Starkeys are coming in. ( senses ) They grabbed Gina.
TRUDY: They grabbed Gina.
ISABELLA: It's all bullshit. Jesus is out of communication in Fals de Iguazu. José knows that. Whatever he's going to do, he has to do it fast because he's acting on his own. And he will need a story.
TUBBS: They will kill you. And then they will kill your wife, too.
ISABELLA: They will kill you. And then they will kill your wife, too.
CROCKETT: Yero, by himself?
ISABELLA: Maybe. Maybe with the crazy
ZITO: We're half loaded.
TRUDY: Gina. Like Alonzo's wife. Cochi Loco's got her.
CROCKETT: Dump the rest. Let's get the boats up that river.
CROCKETT: José Yero changed-up the drop plan on us. He's grabbed Gina.
CASTILLO: Where's the new drop point.?
CROCKETT: They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last What do you think?
CASTILLO: What do you think?
CROCKETT: It's a rip and a hit.
CASTILLO: ( to someone else ) Get me Air Support. ( to Crockett ) We'll be airborne and assault the You can't.
CROCKETT: You can't.
TUBBS: They'll kill Gina.
CASTILLO: They may have already, so we protect the living. Proof she's Supposedly it's coming.
CROCKETT: Supposedly it's coming.
TUBBS: ( into phone )
TUBBS: They're proving it's right now. And that she's alive right now.
TUBBS: Smell. Bad smell. Trailer. She's allergic to diethylene.she in a meth lab?
CROCKETT: Just came in. She's still alive.
CASTILLO: Safe house is empty. Air Support's set to jump when we know your drop point. Gina?
TUBBS: ( takes phone ) She's sending a message. Meth Lab. Trailer park. Anything with interesting antenna arrays.?
CASTILLO: There's three between Miami International and the glades. I'm gonna try for her, but this is triage. Protect the maximum number of lives. You need to know that.
STRYKER: jam over the swells into Government Channel, NOT SLOWING this time, even though the limit is 15 knots. Barely missing sport fishing boats, slower recreational craft.
TUBBS: Trudy and I are goin' for Gina.
ISABELLA: If they attack you.
CROCKETT: ( finishes ) .it's gonna be an L-shaped ambush. They're not gonna open up until they got the party favors, 'cause all they'd get is a lot of police scrambling to a gunfight. They will wait till they got the goods before they do the deed.
TRUDY: ( into radio, to Castillo ) Have eyes on her. She's alive. Moving in.
ARYAN BROTHER: You order Chinese?
ARYAN BROTHER: Too late. Door's opened.
TUBBS: rips Long-Hair through the door, down the stairs, where two SWAT slam him into the ground. He struggles. A baton slams twice across the back of his neck. He's out. Handcuffed, and Tubbs and Trudy are in the interior.
TUBBS: HOLD IT!! PUT DOWN THE DETONATOR!
HOLD IT!!: Bulked-out Aryan has a handgun in one hand, detonator in the other. Eyes wide. Standoff. The Old Woman in house dress is SCREAMING. Her retarded Son sees Tubbs/Gina as a threat to his mother.grabs butcher knife.rushes forward FROZEN. Aryan doesn't move. The FARQ-like necklace of C-4 around Gina's neck.
TRUDY: PUT DOWN THE DETONATOR!
GINA: struggles against plastic ties, to hear, to see, as.
OBESE SON: shouts, surges past bulky Aryan, heading for Tubbs.
TUBBS: prepares for the autistic son, not seeing behind him.
ARYAN BROTHER: Shoot me, she dies. Hey, fuck it, man. We can all go.
TRUDY: ( cool ) That's not what will happen. ( that stops him ) What will happen is. ( as she's aiming her Car- .what will happen is, I will put a round precisely through the medula at the base of your brain, at an entry-point mid-distance between your upper lip and the bottom of your nose, and you will be dead from the neck down. Your finger won't be able to twitch. Do you believe that?
ARYAN BROTHER: BLAM. That's all he gets out. Trudy does exactly that. Aryan Brother falls like a felled tree. Tubbs retrieves the detonator. Trudy unties Gina. Carefully, Tubbs pulls the sensitive remote detonator from his hands.
TUBBS: puts his coat over Gina. As she half leaves, turns to the fallen AB.
GINA: She kicks him in the head. Tubbs grabs her to pull her off.
TUBBS: He's dead!
TRUDY: ( on radio, to Castillo ) .got Gina. She's okay.
CASTILLO: ( into loud hailer )
ENCRYPTION: The technicians are eating in the next room. We hear the
YERO: ( in Spanish ) Isabella. The gringos are police. She's their informant.!
YERO: EXT. STREET + BRIDGE - YERO'S SUBURBAN pulls out, racing to get away from the firefight. But BRIGHT LIGHT freezes it.heavy rounds slam into the engine, crack the block, stream sprays, it seizes up. Suburban crashes into a car at the curb. Yero bails out.
PA: ( loud hailer ) Freeze! You're under arrest. Down on your knees. Put your hands on your head.
ON TUBBS: aiming down at CAM. The assault rifle unloads in three-shot OVER TUBBS DOWN TO YERO IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT The pavement, the car and Yero are cratered by the 7.62mm rounds. Yero goes down. Dead.
SWITEK: is shot in the calf, spins, goes down, gets up, limps to cover, keeps firing.
ISABELLA: runs from cover into the clear with her handgun firing at the crazy whites, furious at the betrayal by Yero. She's shouting in Spanish. It's insane.
CROCKETT: sees Isabella, moves.
COLEMAN: sees Isabella, swings his assault rifle onto her as.
CROCKETT: CROCKETT RUNS and sees Coleman because he's turned he's exposed his legs and Crockett slows and blows Coleman's legs out from under him. Coleman's on the ground, scrambling for his rifle to kill Isabella. Dark-Haired NLR is pulling the trigger on Crockett when BOOM.
CROCKETT RUNS: and sees Coleman because he's turned he's exposed his legs and Crockett slows and blows Coleman's legs out from under him. Coleman's on the ground, scrambling for his rifle to kill Isabella. Dark-Haired NLR is pulling the trigger on Crockett when BOOM.
TUBBS: fires the M40 grenade launcher loaded with shot. Dark-Haired NLR is nearly cut in half.
CROCKETT: goes to Isabella, pulls her into the shadows away from dockside, keeping her low, seemingly away from the police. OK, how will they get out of here?
ISABELLA: thinks this is it. She's dead. SWAT, shotguns and assault rifles, approach.
CROCKETT: Touch the windshield with your hands. Let 'em see your hands are empty. Steady.
SWAT SERGEANT: ( approaching ) Don't move! Don't move! Keep your hands where I can see them. Yeah. Hey, Robert.
CROCKETT: Yeah. Hey, Robert.
SWAT SERGEANT: Are you okay?!
CROCKETT: Yeah. Going to Miami General. Check out Gina. Everybody's okay. Everybody's fine.
ISABELLA: stares at him. Incredulous. For the first time she realizes he's the police and has been undercover. And now she hits EXT. HIGHWAY - MERCEDES swerves across three lanes, up on two wheels, almost rolls, cuts off a semi, which barely recovers, and spins out onto the shoulder, off the shoulder, down into the gravel. It comes to a stop and.
CROCKETT: No reply. Isabella wonders where he's taking her, what will happen to her, but she won't ask.
ISABELLA: What are you going to do with me? Are you taking me to jail? You think I will turn into your informant, is that it?
CROCKETT: CUT TO:
CROCKETT: No part of it wasn't real.
ISABELLA: I know. And now?
CROCKETT: It still is. I'm so in this, I don't know which way is up. All I know is I won't let anything bad happen to you. Just like I said. And I know we can't ever see each other again. And we never will.
ISABELLA: You said time is luck.
CROCKETT: Luck ran out. This was too good to last.
