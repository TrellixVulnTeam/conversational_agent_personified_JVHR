"HEADHUNTERS": by Jules Bass
THIRD DRAFT: November 4, 2007
ALICE: "By tomorrow, we will have flown to She turns to face her TENTH GRADE FRENCH CLASS. Though Alice's make up, earrings and practical flats are simple, there is an inherent elegance to their combination that hints at a more complex, if uncharted, interior.
PAUL: "I will have completed the assigned translation by the end of C'est bon! Amber?
ALICE: C'est bon! Amber?
AMBER: I will have failed French again by the end of the year. Alice pauses, regarding Amber with a pained sympathy.
ALICE: En francais si'l vows plait?
EMMA: So, the definition of the derivative of the function "f" at point "x" is..?
KYLE: Um. I guess I'm a little lost. If optimists see a glass as half full, Emma's is in a constant state of cheerful, blonde overflow, even when a level of wilfulness is required.
EMMA: Try to follow along. I really want you guys to get this! David? DAVID gazes back dumbly, stuck in an erotic fog.
IS: INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HOME ARTS LAB - DAY TWO GIRLS ( 17 ) laugh conspiratorially, dredging woven pot holders through an egg mixture and dropping them into a sputtering pan, as the rest of the CLASS makes French toast. The girls sneak looks at MEG KELLY ( 30's ) who tears recipes from a Gourmet magazine at her desk at the front of the room. Dark hair pulled into a pony tail, face unadorned by makeup, Meg's natural sexiness is muted by an air of indifference. She glances up when the pan erupts in flames and the girls leap back with a shriek, shakes her head. The girls attempt to knock the pan from the burner with the handle of a broom when a pot lid bangs down, instantly snuffing the flames. They shrink back as Meg waves the lid, clearing the smoke.
MEG: Do me a favor, and let's just try to get to vacation. The class bell RINGS!
RICHARD: Got practice until five thirty, then I'll be by.
ALICE: I'll see you then. Thanks. They kiss again and Richard takes off for the athletic fields, passing Meg as she comes from the school, waves.
RICHARD: Hey, Meg! Bon voyage! Alice offers a binder to Meg as she arrives at Alice's car.
ALICE: I finished our travel binders! Meg takes the binder, looks it over.
MEG: Remind me again why we're taking phonebooks to France? Alice gives her a look.
ALICE: Where's Emma? She knows we're meeting, right?
MEG: Forgot her purse. ( watching the students )
ALICE: Oh, that's right. I keep forgetting your life is completely over. So sad. I'm really going to miss you.
MEG: Well, that was a close call! They turn to see Emma. crossing the parking lot holding a quality knock-off designer handbag over her head.
EMMA: Well, that was a close call! They turn to see Emma. crossing the parking lot holding a quality knock-off designer handbag over her head.
MEG: Look at her. The only teacher in Racine County that wears four inch heels in six feet of snow.
ALICE: She always looks great, doesn't Damn her.
ME G: ( WITH AFFECTION )
EMMA: ( ARRIVES )
MEG: Where'd you find it?
EMMA: Second floor girl's bathroom. Right where I left it. This
MORNING: ( SEES BINDER )
ALICE: Emma, we're a team.
EMMA: I'd just be sitting around the condo, trolling e-Harmony.
MEG: The fact that you have trouble finding a date
EMMA: I'm telling you, it's this town!
MEG: Gives me less than no hope.
EMMA: You know what we should do, Meg? When we're over there? we should all treat ourselves. Find a real salon. Total spa treatment. And I'm gonna get my hair done. Just like this! She holds up a European tabloid she's pulled from her purse, stabbing a finger at a photograph: CORDELIA WINTHROP SCOTT ( 30's ), a blonde heiress deflecting paparazzi in couture. NOTE: EMMA and CORDELIA are Played by the same actress.
ALICE: Look at us. Meg and Emma turn to Alice, smiling.
ALICE: Come on. Please. please.
FINN: She wants to see Paris, too!
MEG: Finn, if Edith goes to Paris with me, she can't go to Daddy's with Finn's brows come together as she considers this, then reaches for the dog.
FINN: EXT. MEG'S HOUSE - NIGHT GLENN ( 30s ), in a police uniform, watches Meg squeeze her children tightly.
MEG: ( TO SEAMUS )
GLENN: Seam, why don't you take your sister to the car while your mom and I talk.
FINN: Can we get on the radio?
MEG GLENN: No. No. just as KARYN ( 30's, also in uniform ) emerges on the passenger side to meet them.
GLENN: And no lights!
KARYN: Hey, Meg! Meg lifts her chin in greeting, but that's it.
GLENN: I uh. I heard from my lawyer. She said you'd signed your papers. Meg watches her kids climb in the car with Karyn.
MEG: You and me? ( a nod to the car ) You and me, Meg. A beat as they look at one another, hold.
GLENN: You and me, Meg. A beat as they look at one another, hold.
SEAMUS: Seamus reappears, charging up the walk to pull Meg down to his level, hugging her.
ANSWERING MACHINE: You have no messages. Leaning on the lip of the kitchen's bar, Emma presses the record button on her answering machine, then speaks with a put-on, coolly sophisticated,'jet-setting accent.
EMMA: Hello. You've reached the home of Emma Lindgard. I'm afraid I won't be able to return your call right away, as I'm currently traveling. In Europe. But, please, do leave a ". .She was known as 'The People's Emma turns at the counter to see Princes Diana touring an African encampment with children on the television.
TV ANNOUNCER: ". .She was known as 'The People's Emma turns at the counter to see Princes Diana touring an African encampment with children on the television.
EMMA: She hangs up the phone and sits herself down at the coffee table where a game of solitaire is laid next to a microwaved Lean Cuisine dinner. She turns up the volume with the remote and gathers the cards, shuffling. Eyes glued to Princess Diana on television, Emma suddenly shoots her hands three feet wide, rifling the cards in perfect vertical formation like a seasoned cardsharp.
RICHARD: Special delivery.
ALICE: That's it! I am good to go!
RICHARD: I'm proud of you, you know. Alice takes her glass and presses Richard down onto the bed, climbing on top of him.
ALICE: Like Christmas when I was a kid. There's no way I'm going to be able to sleep tonight
RICHARD: Good for me. They kiss.
ALICE: I mean, how long have I been talking about this?
RICHARD: Mmm. You were reading Colette. In the teacher's lounge. First time we met. Long time. Alice pauses as this lands somewhere deep inside.
ALICE: ( BRIGHTENING )
RICHARD: Let's try it on.
ALICE: But, we can't even celebrate
RICHARD: What are you talking about? We're
CELEBRATING: But, I'm leaving. I'm. I'm getting on a plane in the morning.
ALICE: But, I'm leaving. I'm. I'm getting on a plane in the morning.
RICHARD: ( LAUGHS )
BACK: ( stops, sobers ) Wait. You're serious. Are you serious? You're serious.
ALICE: Let's do this when I get back. In a week.
RICHARD: Can you hear yourself?
ALICE: Honey, listen, it's just the timing. I wasn't planning on this
TONIGHT: Whoa. I planned tonight. Tonight was my plan
RICHARD: Whoa. I planned tonight. Tonight was my plan
ALICE: And it's great. This is great. You're great. But, Richard, I feel like I just need to do this one thing first. Then I can do the next. Then I can do this. ( off his silence ) Can you understand? There's a world I haven't even seen yet. Alice, hopeful, searches Richard's inscrutable expression a beat, then he turns away and gets up, ring in hand.
RICHARD: I thought we'd be seeing it ( pockets the ring ) Have a great trip, Alice. He heads for the door.
ALICE: ( STRICKEN )
RICHARD: ( without looking back ) Maybe I'll see you in a week. Alice listens to his footfalls and the slam of the front door, then falls back on the bed, striking her head on the open suitcase, wincing.
ALICE: ( MISERABLE )
EMMA: Are we there?!
CUSTOMS AGENT: Bien venue. Alice looks up from her imprinted passport, smiles hugely.
ALICE: Merci .
EMMA: There it is! Esprit de Corps! Alice looks to where Emma points, seeing a small sky-blue flag at the end of a long staff held by MADAME VALERY ( 40s, pinched ) their harried tour guide in a suit of the same blue.
ALICE: Excuse me, are you Madame Valery?
MADAME VALERY: ( GESTURING )
ALICE: I'm traveling with my friends, Meg Kelly and Emma Lindgard
MADAME VALERY: ( FLAT )
EMMA: Well, that's great!
ALICE: We're so excited! Madame Valery eyes Alice unfolding a map from her binder.
MADAME VALERY: ( WEARILY PREDICTIVE )
MADAME VALERY: ( over bus's P.A. ) On your right. Alice, squashed beside Meg on the over-crowded bus, whips her head up from her guidebook.
ALICE: This is ridiculous.
EMMA: Hey, Alice! Meg! thumb at CARL and DEEDEE ( late 60's, both stout ) beside her.
CARL: Waited a long time for this! But, we finally made it!
EMMA: Alice, that's like you! ( back to couple ) We're here celebrating my friend Meg's divorce!
ALICE: Try to remember that! We'll double back for the Chagalls!
ALICE: ( READING FAST )
DEEDEE: Well, that saved us a climb.
EMMA: ( waving her camera ) I got it! I got it!
EMMA: Alice, I'll e-mail it to you. Meg looks up, catching Alice eyeing their surroundings.
MEG: ( re: Mona Lisa ) At least she's smiling.
ALICE: ( snaps to, smiling ) What? No. I'm. I'm just a little tired.
EMMA: ( a happy idea ) Hey! I'll bet you have jet lag! We'll probably all get it! Meg raises a glass of wine.
MEG: To jet lag. Emma and Alice raise their glasses to toast as WAITERS plunk down identical plates of steak frites before them.
EMMA: To Alice! They clink glasses and Alice is suddenly jostled, just as she's about to sip, by Carl as he turns from the table behind her, spilling her wine.
DEEDEE: Oh, Carl!
CARL: I am so sorry!
ALICE: ( mopping her front )
IT'S OKAY: He was just looking for the catsup-
DEEDEE: He was just looking for the catsup-
CARL: If you're not using it. As Emma passes the bottle of catsup, Meg offers Alice her napkin, and waiters sweep their plates away, replacing them with creme brulees.
ALICE: Oh! No. Wait. Pardon, Monsieur
CARL: ( RECEIVING CATSUP )
ALICE: Pardon, Madame, but. Madam Valery slowly raises her eyes from Alice's hand.
MEG: Are you apologizing?
ALICE: They've taken our dinners away Madame Valery taps her watch and then her clipboard.
MADAME VALERY: There were stragglers at the. museum. Now, I am behind schedule.
EMMA: Toujour le suck-ez vous.
ALICE: I researched at least a million
TOURS: Well. This is the one we could A beat as they consider the room and their lot in life.
MEG: Well. This is the one we could A beat as they consider the room and their lot in life.
EMMA: Five nights? Here?!
MEG: And, Alice, you said yourself, we'll hardly ever be in our room.
EMMA: Here's your outhouse, Meg. Go Alice joins Emma at the bathroom door.
MEG: Okay, Emma. Let's just unpack she turns for the luggage, nearly falling over at the weight of Emma's suitcase as she reaches to lift it.
ALICE: Emma, what have you got in here?
EMMA: Just the stuff you put on my list ( off her look ) And a couple options. The bag slips from Meg's grasp, crashing onto the foot of the bed which collapses, catapulting Alice onto the cot which flips up over her, knocking Emma into the tiny bathroom.
MADAME VALERY: The Pont des Arts has it's name for the vast number of art students that come here to paint this famous city view. Meg and Emma, the worse for wear, trail Madame Valery at a distance with Alice who now leads her own handful of tour members, Carl and Deedee among them.
ALICE: It's called the Pont des Arts because the Louvre was formally known as the Palais des Arts. Madame Valery stops ahead, turning back to take in Alice and her cluster of appreciative followers.
MADAME VALERY: People! We must keep together!
DEEDEE: "Point zero. Dez roots dee France."
ALICE: It's from right here that all the highway miles in all of France are measured. They also say that if you stand on this exact spot, you are be destined to return to France in the future.
MEG: Oh, I'm in! Come on. Everyone! Together, they all step forward, arms entwined, laughing.
EMMA: I want a picture! Of all of us! Alice looks up as Emma breaks away, to see Madam Valery leading her dwindling group from the great church. Madame Valery sends her charges to the bus, then heads straight for Alice as Emma tries to enlist a JAPANESE COUPLE to take a group photo with her camera.
MADAME VALERY: My head count was short in the I'm sorry. I was explaining about
ALICE: I'm sorry. I was explaining about
POINT ZERO: Madame Valery sizes Alice up and taps her staff as the group forms around them, joined by the Japanese couple.
MADAME VALERY: This flag? I do not carry it for my pleasure.
ALICE: We were just on our way inside
MADAME VALERY: Well, now you may head to the bus.
ALICE: But, we haven't been
MADAME VALERY: Which is why you must follow my okay. We will. I promise. But, these people haven't seen the
ALICE: okay. We will. I promise. But, these people haven't seen the
MADAME VALERY: There are many churches on the But, this is Notre Dame! They need to see this
ALICE: But, this is Notre Dame! They need to see this
MADAME VALERY: I assure you, they will see everything they need to see
ALICE: ( LOSING IT )
MADAME VALERY: You seem quite the Paris expert, for someone who has never been.
EMMA: Ill bet she knows more about it than you! The Japanese wife frames the action with Emma's camera.
ALICE: I might not have ever been here before, but.
CARL: We've waited thirty years
MEG: You tell her, Carl.
ALICE: You keep rushing us through, like this is some kind of race
MADAME VALERY: Perhaps, if Madame is not satisfied with my tour she could conduct her What'd she say? Alice's eyes narrow in regarding Madame Valery and all fall silent a beat; a crowd anticipating fireworks. CLICK! The Japanese wife snaps a picture of the standoff,
EMMA: What'd she say? Alice's eyes narrow in regarding Madame Valery and all fall silent a beat; a crowd anticipating fireworks. CLICK! The Japanese wife snaps a picture of the standoff,
CROWD: Madame Valery, nonplussed, reaches out to reclaim her flag, but Alice jerks it further away, while the Japanese woman snaps picture after picture.
DEEDEE: Carl, we're getting on the bus! Madame Valery lunges for the stick.
EMMA: That was fantastic!
MEG: "A" plus! Alice, cheeks flushed, watches Carl waving goodbye from the
ALICE: Now, the real tour can begin!
MEG: Let's kick this town's ass! Alice marches forward as a few drops of rain fall.
EMMA: I think it's starting to rain
ALICE: Who cares? We're in Paris! What's a little rain?
PHOTOGRAPHER 1: They glance over at a few PAPARAZZI sharing the protection of the overhang on the far side of the entrance, as a camera flashes in taking Emma's picture. Emma smiles, blinks, confused as another photographer admonishes the first.
PHOTOGRAPHER 2: You're wasting your film. That's not her.
EMMA: What're they saying? Alice looks about in equal confusion, but stops short when she sees the opulent restaurant behind the window's glass.
ALICE: Meg and Emma turn to gape as well at the DINERS and elegant tables inside as the rain hammers down.
EMMA: You think they'd let me use the INT. LE MEURICE HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT Meg and Emma step into the lobby, a palatial world of marble, gold and flowers, as Alice confers with the DOORMAN.
EMMA: ( CONTINUED )
ALICE: ( TO DOORMAN )
EMMA: Meet you in there. Emma heads for the ladies room, gaping at the lobby.
MEG: Get us a table? Alice, we can't afford to eat here
ALICE: My treat.
ME G: You can't afford-
ALICE: ( hooking Meg's arm ) We're going to do one thing right in Paris. I don't care how much it They turn for the dining room, passing the front desk where CORDELIA WINTHROP SCOTT ( dressed similarly to Emma, though at ten times the cost ) unleashes her ire on the CONCIERGE.
CORDELIA: And, just how do you propose I am to travel tomorrow, then?
CONCIERGE: I am sorry, but, there is nothing A MANAGER enters from the back.
MANAGER: Mademoiselle Scott, I have checked and there is no sign of a package
CORDELIA: Marvelous. I'd like to see someone who speaks English, please. If there is such a person in France. The concierge and manager look to one another and back.
MANAGER: This is not English we are INT. LE MEURICE HOTEL LADIES ROOM - NIGHT Emma swings through the door into the black marble bathroom, grabbing a towel to swipe at her wet hair. She stops abruptly, examines the towel.
EMMA: These are cloth! She takes the towel into one of the stalls, closing the door behind her just as Cordelia strides in, stops at the counter.
CORDELIA: ( ACID DISGUST )
CORDELIA: ( INTO PHONE )
PERFECTLY HIDEOUS: Alice and Meg look at one another in the mirror, overhearing Cordelia, as they pick up towels to dry off.
ALICE: EMMA ( 0. S. ) Yeah. I'm here.
EMMA: Did you see those are cloth?
MEG: No, Emma, I mean, exactly like you.
EMMA: Well, she sounded awful. And kind of mean. Alice, Meg and Emma, punchy and a little drunk, enjoy wine from enormous glasses as they finish their meals.
ALICE: ( draining her glass ) She should be ashamed. Can you imagine having a room here and then not staying in it? An ANXIOUS WAITER races in, refilling Alice's glass.
EMMA: ( PERFECT MIMIC )
MEG: We should just take it. Her room.
EMMA: And her trip to Monte Carlo!
MEG: Alice, how fast can you get a binder going on a trip like that?
ALICE: ( LAUGHS )
MEG: What's so funny about that? We got in here.
EMMA: ( MIMICKING )
WAITER: ( whispers to other ) She is a monster!
MEG: Emma, you could be her!
EMMA: ( MIMICKING ) ( DROPPING IT )
MANAGER: Pardon, Mademoiselle Scott? The three look up at the manager in surprise.
ALICE: I'm so sorry. Were we being too No, no, we are all very happy to see Mademoiselle Scott smile. A WINE STEWARD hustles up to the table with an ice bucket stand and a bottle of Champagne.
MANAGER: No, no, we are all very happy to see Mademoiselle Scott smile. A WINE STEWARD hustles up to the table with an ice bucket stand and a bottle of Champagne.
EMMA: Our misunder?
MANAGER: Your dinners as well. With our The three women exchange glances as the steward begins to open the bottle and the manager bows, backing away.
EMMA: Excuse me, Monsieur?
MANAGER: Oui, Mademoiselle? Emma smiles, broadly, batting her eyelashes as the steward pops the Champagne cork.
EMMA: ( PERFECT BRITISH )
ME G: Alice sees but one the thing: The Eiffel tower illuminated on the other side of a bank of French doors.
HOLY: Alice sees but one the thing: The Eiffel tower illuminated on the other side of a bank of French doors.
EMMA: Alice sees but one the thing: The Eiffel tower illuminated on the other side of a bank of French doors.
ALICE: A view! There's a view. Alice races to push back the window sheers, revealing a staggering panorama of the city, the Seine, and the Eiffel tower in the pouring rain. The entire city of light is reflected in her eyes.
MEG: There's whole other room in here!
ALICE: Wait. What are you guys doing? Emma launches herself onto the enormous bed.
EMMA: This is the room we were supposed to have!
ALICE: On what planet? Come on. We were only going to take a look!
MEG: So, we're looking. ( pops the Champagne ) And we like what we see.
ALICE: Meg takes the bottle and crawls up with Emma.
EMMA: Alice, take a break, would you? We
ALICE: ( pats the bed ) Alice, how many do chances do we get? For something like this? Alice considers, looks out the window at the streaming rain.
BUT: ( pats the bed ) Alice, how many do chances do we get? For something like this? Alice considers, looks out the window at the streaming rain.
MEG: ( pats the bed ) Alice, how many do chances do we get? For something like this? Alice considers, looks out the window at the streaming rain.
ALICE: Okay. But, just until it stops raining. Then we go.
MEG: ( makes room for Alice ) Alice climbs up and together, the three pass the bottle of Champagne as they study the ceiling's ornate plasterwork.
EMMA: I'm glad I got pictures!
ALICE: I did surprise her
MEG: Surprised me!
EMMA: Really loved that flag, didn't she?
ALICE: Poor Carl and Deedee.
EMMA: Do you think that if you sleep in a bed like this every night your dreams are different? Alice rolls to her side and the view of the Eiffel tower.
MEG: Well. We'll never know. Seen from the bed, the light atop the Eiffel tower breaks through the dissipating clouds to swing a searching arc through the night sky.
MATCH DISSOLVE: The Eiffel tower gleams gold and orange in the morning sun.
ALICE: ( ANSWERING )
EMMA: What time is it? Alice's eyes fly open as she snaps awake.
ALICE: Oh, yes. Yes.
EMMA: ( SHAKING MEG )
MEG: Oh, shiii
ALICE: We'll be right down. Merci. She hangs up.
EMMA: We were only joking! We didn't mean to!
MEG: We'll tell them it was a mistake!
EMMA: Cordelia, your car is here.
ALICE: Cordelia, your car is here.
MANAGER: Mademoiselle Scott!
ALICE: Just keep moving. The three women increase their pace, but the manager catches up to them with an express envelope.
MANAGER: Mademoiselle Scott, this came for you this morning. The package you were seeking? Emma merely blinks at the offered envelope.
MEG: Take it. Just take it.
EMMA: ( SNATCHING IT )
MANAGER: I'm afraid there may still be some

WALK: ( LAUGHS ) ( STOPS FAST )
MANAGER: ( LAUGHS ) ( STOPS FAST )
ALICE: ( STOPS FAST )
ALICE: It's fine. It's fine. We'll just have him drop us off. Alice and Meg look out the back window at the manager who waves them farewell, the doorman shooing photographers.
MEG: They really do think she's her. RIP! Alice and Meg spin to Emma as she spills the envelope 's What? I want to know where we're We're going back to our hotel Emma holds up an itinerary with a big mischievous grin.
EMMA: What? I want to know where we're We're going back to our hotel Emma holds up an itinerary with a big mischievous grin.
ALICE: We're going back to our hotel Emma holds up an itinerary with a big mischievous grin.
EMMA: No. We're going to Monte Carlo!
ALICE: No. We're not.
MEG: ( TAKING ITINERARY )
EMMA: Alice, what's "prive?" Is that like an airline?
ALICE: Emma, for crying out loud. Meg, you want to help me out here?
MEG: Hold on. I'm reading.
EMMA: See? Meg wants to go. Don't you, Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 35.
ALICE: No, Meg, doesn't. Meg looks up from the itinerary, shrugs.
MEG: Trip's paid for, whether that girl takes it or not.
ALICE: Oh! And somehow that magically makes taking it right?
EMMA: What's the worst that could happen?
ALICE: I can think of a lot of things
MEG: You're in charge. You want to go back to that hotel, okay by me. A beat while Alice looks between Meg and Emma, trapped.
EMMA: ( FULL-ON CORDELIA )
ALICE: Okay. We go. We take a look around. We get on a train and come right back.
MEG: Anything goes wrong, we say it was a language thing, that we didn't
UNDERSTAND: Now, I like that idea, because it's They fall silent as the steward appears with glasses of Champagne, wait for him to retreat.
EMMA: Now, I like that idea, because it's They fall silent as the steward appears with glasses of Champagne, wait for him to retreat.
ALICE: Go, look, come right back. It's a good plan. Alice, Meg and Emma clink glasses.
ALICE: Okay! What do we want to do first? Check out the palace, or the beach?
MEG EMMA: Beach! Palace?!
EMMA: Well, bon jour me.
TRAVEL: ( laughs at himself ) But, you are here. ( off her blank look ) Forgive me. Jean-Pierre. Michand. With the foundation He pauses in shaking Emma's hand as his eyes land on Alice with friendly curiosity, a charge.
EMMA: Oh, I'm sorry! This is Alice Perry and Meg Kelly. Two of my dearest friends. Visiting from America!
ALICE: ( SHAKING HANDS )
EMMA: I'll say. Emma sneakily indicates Jean-Pierre's empty ring finger to Alice and Meg as he consults his wristwatch.
MEG: We won't keep you
EMMA: Invitations for the week?
AUCTION: ( THE WATCH )
EMMA: His Highness?
ALICE: You are very generous, and we'd love to, but, I'm afraid Cordelia has other plans this evening Jean-Pierre turns, charmed by Alice's perfect French, and alarmed by this news.
BUT: We're very sorry
ALICE: We're very sorry
EMMA: What's he saying? Which prince? Jean-Pierre looks imploringly between the three.
ALICE: ( ANGUISHED )
MEG: No, I can't. I can't stand it. Emma reads to Alice and Meg from the brochure in the seating area of their luxurious suite, enjoying none of it, nor the incredible balcony view of Monte Carlo's marina and bay.
EMMA: "With your help The Michand Foundation is able to sow the seeds of education, transforming lives, families, and villages, one child at a time." She didn't say anything about a school!
MEG: Schools, with an "s." More than Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 40
ALICE: ( MISERABLE )
MEG: That horrible, irresponsible girl! I've never stolen a thing in my life, now I've taken a trip from school children.
ALICE: In Africa. Meg hangs her head.
EMMA: Reykjavik! That takes some nerve! They're counting on her for a charity auction and she doesn't even show up!
ALICE: Only she did. Emma reaches for a gigantic wrapped fruit basket.
EMMA: She did?
MEG: Do not touch that!
ALICE: You, Emma. If you're Cordelia. They've seen you. You're here.
EMMA: Well, I can't go to that thing I don't have anything to wear. The phone RINGS! and Emma snatches it up before Alice can.
ALICE: Okay. But, just for tonight. And, that's it. CLICK! Alice and Meg look to Emma, holding the now open briefcase, eyes wide.
EMMA: Lucky guess?
ALICE: ( CLOSING IT )
MEG: INT. LES CASINO DES MONTE CARLO - NIGHT The gaming hall's towering ornate doors are opened by TWO DOORMEN for Alice, Emma and Meg to make their big entrance in Cordelia's couture chiffon, silk and organza. Heads held high, backs straight, they strike a remarkable tableaux as they pause in unison at the top of the room's raised landing to survey the swirl of roulette wheels and the
EMMA: Don't you feel like we've won something already? Jean-Pierre comes to greet them with PRINCE DOMENICO DA SILVANO ( 30's, movie-star handsome ), both in tuxedos, offering a hand to escort Emma down the few steps.
EMMA: Jean-Pierre assists Meg and Alice, Meg clutching the top of her dress, Alice anxiously keeping the skirt of hers in place with a hand as she steps down.
DOMENICO: MADEMOISELLE SCOTT
MADEMOISELLE SCOTT: Please, call me "Cordelia."
EMMA: Please, call me "Cordelia."
DOMENICO: If you will call me "Domenico."
EMMA: I shall certainly try. Domenico escorts Emma out onto the casino floor as Jean- Pierre touches Alice's elbow.
MEG: ( aside to Alice ) I may as well be topless.
ALICE: Please. I'm mooning everyone behind us.
EMMA: Oh, but, I really wasn't planning on playing this evening. I so much prefer to watch Emma looks to Alice and Meg for help as Jean-Pierre leads them to the far side of a low railing to view the game.
DOMENICO: ( A WINK )
ALICE: ( TO JEAN-PIERRE )
ALICE: They're playing for money? ( turns to Meg, flat )
IS: They're playing for money. Together they turn to see Emma happily arranging the cards she is dealt in her hands.
DOMENICO: Cordelia, why don't you do us the honor of setting this evening's Emma glances over to Alice and Meg who look back at her, ashen, and turns to the players who smile expectantly.
EMMA: Oh. Um. Okay. She takes her handbag into her lap, opens it, looks.
DOMENICO: He signals an ATTENDANT over as Emma's shoulders relax.
EMMA: ( BIG GULP )
MEG: A riot. Domenico casts a glossy chip into the pot.
DOMENICO: Mademoiselle Scott starts us at ten thousand a hand. Alice and Meg freeze, their champagne glasses sliding from their hands, while Emma's eyes grow as large as all the zeroes on Domenico's chip.
DEALER: Mademoiselle Scott? It is your Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 46.
MEG: ( takes bottle from waiter ) I should probably keep this.
DEALER: ( PRODDING )
EMMA: She moves her hands to the stacks and stacks of chips beside her, and pushes them to the center of the table.
ALICE: Great. I'm just. Excuse me. Alice slips around the railing and heads for Emma as two players fold in near tears, leaving just Emma, Domenico and a DOWAGER ( 60's ) in the game.
EMMA: ( WHISPER BACK )
ALICE: Emma! That isn't Monopoly money!
EMMA: Relax. I've got it under control
ALICE: And this isn't the mathletes finals in Kenosha!
EMMA: Jean-Pierre, would you be a dear and get Alice some water?
ALICE: I will see you, Cordelia. Domenico pushes his own mountain of chips to the pot in the center of the table and Alice buries her face in her hands when the dowager folds her cards.
DOMENICO: I will see you, Cordelia. Domenico pushes his own mountain of chips to the pot in the center of the table and Alice buries her face in her hands when the dowager folds her cards.
EMMA: ( whisper to Alice ) Now, go sit down and try to be cool, would you? Jeeze! Let me handle this. Alice moves back to her stool, tries to smile as she takes the water Jean-Pierre offers.
MEG: What'd she say? What'd she say?
ALICE: ( SICK )
DEALER: Mademoiselle. Your Highness. Your 0 cards, please.
DOMENICO: Ladies first.
EMMA: After you. Please. Domenico can hardly contain his gloating as he reveals his three aces.
DOMENICO: I am very sorry, Cordelia. A beat, then Emma shrugs.
EMMA: Well. It is just a game after all. She turns her cards over and fans them on the table felt: A royal flush in the suit of hearts, ace high.
DOWAGER: You must play often, Miss Scott.
EMMA: Oh, a little, online. But, this is so much more fun!
DOMENICO: Not even a last drink in the bar?
EMMA: It's been such a splendid evening, I am reluctant to press my luck any Yeah. Good call, Cordelia. DING! The elevator arrives and the doors open as Domenico leans in towards Emma.
MEG: Yeah. Good call, Cordelia. DING! The elevator arrives and the doors open as Domenico leans in towards Emma.
DOMENICO: Then you must promise to dance with me at my party tomorrow. Emma evades Domenico by stepping onto the elevator.
EMMA: Oh, Delmonico
DOMENICO: I would not miss it for the world. Meg collects the buckets from Domenico and steps on.
EMMA: I would not miss it for the world. Meg collects the buckets from Domenico and steps on.
MEG: Great meeting you, your Highness. Good times. Really. Jean-Pierre places his buckets in Alice's hands, a certain frisson to the simple exchange.
EMMA: Before Alice can respond to Jean-Pierre, Emma takes one of the buckets from Alice and hands it back to him.
SO GENEROUS: ( CONTINUED )
ALICE: She really believes in education. The doors start to close.
DOMENICO: And, welcome to Monte Carlo. The doors close, leaving Jean-Pierre and Domenico to gaze fondly where the three women had just been. They both sigh and turn for the bar, when they hear shrieking from the elevator as it rises above them.
SHOP GIRL: Would you like these put on your account, Mademoiselle Scott?
ALICE: No. Thank you, we'll be paying
CASH: But, it would be darling if you could have them sent round our Wait. You know what, on second thought, I'm not getting these She pulls the pair of jeans from her pile of clothes.
EMMA: But, it would be darling if you could have them sent round our Wait. You know what, on second thought, I'm not getting these She pulls the pair of jeans from her pile of clothes.
MEG: Wait. You know what, on second thought, I'm not getting these She pulls the pair of jeans from her pile of clothes.
EMMA: But, they looked amazing on you!
MEG: Where was I ever going to wear them? Seriously?
EMMA: You wear them here! Anywhere! Alice, you tell her Alice opens her mouth, but stops herself as the three wander the crowded market stalls heaped with fountains of flowers in every color, breads, fresh produce, trinkets and souvenirs.
ALICE: No. I'm not going to tell you what to do.
MEG: Thank you. It's silly, anyway. They're just jeans. I want to find something for the kids
EMMA: Oh, Meg! Look! For Finn!
ALICE: Even better! Alice holds up a pair of pink satin toe shoes, swinging them from their ribbon laces.
RICHARD: ( REMEMBERING )
GLENN: Hey, Richard! Richard glances up to see Glenn crossing the parking lot with Seamus and Finn, pushing a cart piled high with groceries.
RICHARD: And that's two with sausage, extra sauce, no onions
SEAMUS: Thin crust.
RICHARD: Got it. Richard picks up Alice's suitcase.
FINN: Are you going to France, too?
RICHARD: No. I just Glenn turns, noticing the suitcase for the first time.
GLENN: Whoa! Hold on! You're going to surprise Alice?
FINN: I love surprises!
RICHARD: What? No, I-
GLENN: Oh, man, I win! Richard blinks as Glenn claps him on the shoulder.
RICHARD: Glenn, listen
GLENN: Don't worry! I won't blow it for you! I won't call anyone, ruin the
SURPRISE: ( PLAYFUL PUNCH )
RICHARD: ( confused, but flattered ) Sure! That's why Alice loves you. You get how much this trip's meant to her; now, you're just putting the icing on the cake. The big gesture, you know? Not too dominating: Supportive. Loving! ( shakes his head ) You're the man, Richard. Big Glenn pulls Richard into a big happy bear hug.
GLENN: Sure! That's why Alice loves you. You get how much this trip's meant to her; now, you're just putting the icing on the cake. The big gesture, you know? Not too dominating: Supportive. Loving! ( shakes his head ) You're the man, Richard. Big Glenn pulls Richard into a big happy bear hug.
RICHARD: Glenn. She said, no.
MEG: Oh, no. No. I'm sorry. I'd like to. But. The woman is confused, vaguely insulted.
BERNARD: She is only a visitor. Without a kitchen. But, it is a beautiful fish. Maybe next time. Meg turns to find Bernard beside her.
MEG: Well, thank you. She smiles at the woman and starts to walk away, only to find Bernard falling into step with her.
BERNARD: You are American. Meg glances at Bernard and away, uncomfortable, but curious, drawn by his warmth and the familiar greetings he exchanges with various vendors as they walk.
MEG: From Wisconsin. Yes. Bernard reaches a handkerchief from his jacket for Meg.
BERNARD: You cook in Wisconsin? Meg uses the handkerchief to blot the remaining tomato juice.
MEG: I try. But. We don't have even half of this at home. She points to a tray of miniature lobsters.
BERNARD: Ah, langoustines. Many ways to
PREPARE THESE: I'd go for a saute, being a Midwestern gal.
MEG: I'd go for a saute, being a Midwestern gal.
BERNARD: ( IMPRESSED )
MEG: ( IMPRESSED )
BERNARD: With sea water. Amazing.
MEG: So, you cook. Bernard dips his head modestly.
BERNARD: As you say, "I try." ( offers his hand ) Bernard. Rochand. Meg shakes his hand and returns the handkerchief.
MEG: Meg. Kelly. Thank you again for
YOUR HELP: And, how long are you in Monte Carlo, Meg? Meg's brow furrows slightly and she turns to head back.
BERNARD: And, how long are you in Monte Carlo, Meg? Meg's brow furrows slightly and she turns to head back.
MEG: I need to find my. . My friends are around here somewhere.
BERNARD: I will help you find them. We can
WALK TOGETHER: ( CONTINUED )
MEG: ( LAUGHS )
BERNARD: Yeah. But, I'm gonna walk myself. Thanks, though. She slips into the moving crowd, leaving Bernard to watch as she meets Alice and Emma further up the street. He holds a beat, then turns when called to by a vendor.
MEG: Yeah. But, I'm gonna walk myself. Thanks, though. She slips into the moving crowd, leaving Bernard to watch as she meets Alice and Emma further up the street. He holds a beat, then turns when called to by a vendor.
RICHARD: It's been two days and it didn't occur to you to call anyone?
MADAME VALERY: She refused to follow my instructions. She sabotaged my tour. Ruined it for everyone!
RICHARD: Wait. Alice did? Alice Perry?
MADAME VALERY: She took my flag!
RICHARD: But, if their luggage is still there, then they're missing
GLENN: Missing? What the?
RICHARD: How do I get in touch with the Hey, I'm the police!
GLENN: Hey, I'm the police!
RICHARD: Are you the police in France?
MADAME VALERY: The police? Monsieur. Nothing could keep her from seeing Paris her way. Believe me. She was very What's she saying?
RICHARD: What's she saying?
BUT: What's she saying?
GLENN: What's she saying?
MADAME VALERY: You are the husband, yes? Richard hesitates, looks to Glenn.
RICHARD: ( FIRMLY )
MEG: Alice, she's fine.
ALICE: Actually, sometimes Richard and I go to Madison's on Saturdays
MEG: ( stops dancing, laughs ) The gay bar?
ALICE: ( shrugs, matter of fact ) They've got the best music.
MEG: I am so butting in on that. Alice laughs and spins, crashing directly into Jean-Pierre.
EMMA: Ooh! Thank you! I'm so thirsty! Nikolai remains planted, holding his tray with a smile, watching with bright eyes as Emma drinks. She lowers her glass and her full attention snags on Nikolai, really registering his presence now as she searches his warm, gentle eyes.
ALICE: What? Oh, yeah, of course. Meg dances by herself, having a great time, taking in the room, the music and the people, when a handsome MAN begins to match her moves, insinuates himself. She smiles but shakes her head as she moves away, turning her back to evade him. Another gorgeous MAN sidles up to Meg, joining her solo dance, wiggling his eyebrows invitingly.
MEG: No, thanks. She moves off only to be met by GIORGIO ( 40's, sexy, Euro- suave ) who smoothly steps in.
NO: ( GRINNING WIDE )
GIORGIO: ( GRINNING WIDE )
EMMA: Don't you need to, like, circulate?
NIKOLAI: Ya znal, chto naydu tebya. Emma blushes as though showered in compliments.
EMMA: ( FLAT )
PENELOPE: ( FLAT )
EMMA: ( CONTINUED )
PENELOPE: Do you not know who I am? Emma's smile falters as she glances furtively about.
EMMA: Um. 'Course I do. Hi.
PENELOPE: Penelope. Penelope Penrose. Penelope's chin quivers as she reads Emma's blank look.
EMMA: Hospital? What happened?!
PENELOPE: You did! You happened! Alice swivels around at the raised voices, spots Penelope facing Emma.
ALICE: Excuse me! She dodges away from Jean-Pierre, hooking Meg's arm in passing, yanking her away from Giorgio as she heads for Emma.
PENELOPE: Don't pretend you don't remember! Third year at Le Rosey! You threw my luggage in the pool. Set fire to my mattress. You cut off all my
HAIR: What? That's awful!
MEG: What? That's awful!
PENELOPE: While I was sleeping
EMMA: She did that to you?
ALICE: ( CORRECTING )
PENELOPE: That was just the first night.
ALICE: Say you're sorry, Cordelia.
EMMA: Alice, no. Wait a minute
PENELOPE: ( to Alice and Meg ) she turned all my friends against me. They had to send me away. To live with the nuns Emma grabs Penelope by the shoulders.
EMMA: Now, you listen to me, Penelope Penrose. You have no idea how long I've waited for this moment. Penelope flinches, preparing for a beating.
PENELOPE: ( SMALL )
EMMA: You were so smart. So clever and
BEAUTIFUL: I was ugly
PENELOPE: I was ugly
EMMA: No, Penny. I was ugly. I was a Penny Pignose. That's what you called me
PENELOPE: Penny Pignose. That's what you called me
EMMA: Because, I knew I could never compete! Not with anyone as special as you.
PENELOPE: You thought I was special? Emma looks at Penelope, nods emphatically.
EMMA: You want to know what I've waited for all these years, Penelope Penelope shakes her head almost imperceptibly.
DOMENICO: ( raising a glass ) To friends! old and new! Emma seizes Penelope's hand from across the table, placing it in Domenico's as she drunkenly sings the old Girl Scout song.
EMMA: "Make new friends and keep the old, one is silver and the other's Alice and Jean-Pierre lean toward each other intimately' across the packed, lively table of PARTY-GOERS.
ALICE: People like me?
ALICE: And that works? Jean-Pierre blinks, then bursts out laughing.
ALICE: No. I'm sorry, I didn't mean. I've seen the pictures of the schools. The work you do is
ADMIRABLE: And I'm afraid I talk about it because I myself am not that ( a hand on her arm ) I'd rather know about you.
ALICE: ( TRAPPED )
MEG: Okay, wait. You're a man, right?
GIORGIO: You heart feels betrayed.
MEG: ( telling a secret ) I feel like I failed.
GIORGIO: I tell you this: A man.he will always love the mother of his Meg blinks, taking this in.
MEG: ( LAUGHS )
GIORGIO: To break the spell. You must! Then you will be free. A plate of beautifully arranged langoustine is placed on the table in front of Meg.
MEG: Oh, I'm sorry, 'I didn't order She looks up to find Bernard standing in chef's whites.
BERNARD: ( smiles, nods ) Madame Kelly. He heads toward for the kitchen before she can say anything. Emma pours sloppy glasses of Champagne for her companions as though playing a game of tag, spilling wine.
EMMA: And you're my friend.and you're my friend. . .and you're my She turns with the bottle to find Nikolai who has materialized beside her on the long banquette.
NIKOLAI: Ti takaya vaskhititel'naya. Emma sets the bottle down to concentrate on Nikolai.
EMMA: You're not from here, are you?
NIKOLAI: ( points to himself ) EXT. STREET - PRE-DAWN Alice and Jean-Pierre walk along, side by side, their hands nearly touching, among the rest of the restaurant party. Alice looks up, taking in the bowl of pre-dawn sky, and glances over at Jean-Pierre who watches her.
ALICE: The stars are still out. Ahead, Emma breaks away from Penelope and Domenico, leaving the two to walk on together as she comes back toward Alice.
ALICE: I thought she was right behind us
BERNARD: Papa, sit down. Rest.
MEG: ( SLY SMILE )
BERNARD: You enjoyed your meal?
MEG: Adding the fresh orange; nice. Bernards nods, accepting the compliment.
BERNARD: Next time, you cook.
EMMA: Meg! What are you doing? Come on!
ALICE: We were. We're going to watch the sunrise. Meg hesitates, turning between her friends and Bernard.
BERNARD: ( SMILES )
ALICE: The guy from the market?
EMMA: He is so cute! And a cook!
MEG: Chef .
EMMA: And you're single now! Meg slows to a stop, stands a beat.
MEG: ( QUIETLY )
ALICE: You know, Julia Child didn't take her first cooking class until she was thirty seven.
MEG: ( SMILES )
PENELOPE: It's coming, Cordelia! The sun!
MEG: We'd be getting up now.
ALICE: If we were home.
EMMA: But, we're not.
PHOTOGRAPHER: The spell is broken by a TRIO OF PAPARAZZI who spring to life by the hotel's entrance.
PAPARAZZI: Cordelia! Cordelia!
EMMA: Oh, good! I want a picture! Of the three of us! All of us! The paparazzi swarm from the steps towards Emma.
SPLASH!: EXT. CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT - DAY A 747 airliner touches down on the tarmac.
RICHARD: Excuse me. Pardon me. Richard skirts around a man with a newspaper to retrieve the bag and heads for customs. As Richard exits, the man folds his newspaper to its bold headline: SCOTT MAKES A SPLASH!, and a huge photograph of Emma, Alice and Meg laughing together in the fountain.
EMMA: Alice, have you seen my sandals?
ALICE: Okay, there's a two o'clock and a four o'clock train to
EMMA: Train? Where are you going? Alice looks up and takes in Emma's costume.
ALICE: Where are you going?
EMMA: I'm going to the beach. With Meg enters through the suite's door carrying a bakery bag.
MEG: Breakfast is here! There's this fantastic bakery around the corner. I've already had three brioche. And I saw the greatest little shop for the kids, but they weren't open
YET: ( off Alice's look ) What's going on?
EMMA: I don't know. She's talking about train schedules. Emma trails off as she and Meg and Alice look between each other in confusion, each processing for a beat.
ALICE: We need to start packing, right? If we're going back to Paris
EMMA: Back to Paris?
ALICE: That was the plan
MEG: What plan?
EMMA: We're not staying for the auction?
ALICE: We were just going to come down, take a look around and
MEG: That was before we knew it was for a charity. Remember the kids?
EMMA: In Africa.
ALICE: The ones we stole a trip from? The kids who are paying for this room?
MEG: Alice, what's with you? We'll pay for the room
EMMA: We're rich!
ALICE: So, I'm the only one worried about the fact that we're lying to everyone we've met?
MEG: Lying? To who? Jean-Pierre?
EMMA: You're the one who said we had to go to the casino
ALICE: And now I'm apparently the only who's worried we might get caught.
MEG: She's in Iceland.
ALICE: One of her friends is bound to find out, or her family
MEG: What friends?
EMMA: I've got friends. The doorbell rings and they turn their heads in unison, then look to each other with sudden alarm. A beat. Emma goes to the door, finding Penelope, also dressed for the beach, who holds up the newspaper with it's fountain photo.
PENELOPE: Have you seen?
EMMA: Oh, my god! We look great! ( ushers Penelope in ) Alice, look! Alice takes the paper, Meg reading over her shoulder.
MEG: ( LAUGHS )
PENELOPE: Penelope, could you excuse us?
ALICE: Penelope, could you excuse us?
PENELOPE: Oh. of course. Where? Alice shows Penelope to the bedroom, closes the door and spins to face Emma and Meg.
ALICE: ( HUSHED PANIC )
EMMA: Doesn't it mean we have to stay?
MEG: Oh, this is so typical. Just because it's not on your map, 'cause you didn't plan it. We all agree to take this adventure and then you won't jump.
ALICE: I won't? Jump? Meg drops into a chair, mumbling an aside to herself.
MEG: Now I know how Richard must feel. Alice comes to a full stop and gapes at Meg, stung.
ALICE: ( FEEBLE APOLOGY )
MEG: ( FEEBLE APOLOGY )
ALICE: Well, you're sure one to talk. Meg's eyes flick up to Alice.
EMMA: Okay, you know what? Let's just pack. It's not fun anymore. Alice, if you think we should go, then that's what we're gonna do. You're in charge. Meg scoffs, an exasperated exhale.
ALICE: No way. Not anymore I'm not. You want to go to the beach? Go to the beach. You want to go the market? Go! "Liberte, egalite, What does that mean? Alice snatches up her purse and heads for the door.
EMMA: What does that mean? Alice snatches up her purse and heads for the door.
ALICE: It means everyone should do exactly what they want.
MEG: Alice, wait! Where are you? You're not going back to Paris?
EMMA: Alice, wait! Where are you? You're not going back to Paris?
ALICE: ( RIGHTEOUS ) ( CONTINUED )
MEG: ( off Emma's look ) Don't look at me like that. The door opens, and Alice re-enters, striding across the room for the desk, not looking at either Emma or Meg.
ALICE: I just. My guide book. She picks up her book and crosses back to the door.
CARL: She glances up to find Carl and Deedee from the tour.
DEEDEE: We thought that was you!
ALICE: Oh! Carl! Deedee! Alice is surprisingly overcome and impulsively throws her arms around both of them.
DEEDEE: Well, we're sure surprised to see you, too!
ALICE: But, what are you doing here? How did you?
CARL: Well, when we saw how you stood up to that Madame Valery! If Alice can do that, we thought, what the heck's holdin' us back? This is our honeymoon!
DEEDEE: I was scared, but then, well, you only live once! And as long as we've got each other
CARL: We've got everything, right? Alice blinks, unaccountably teary eyed.
ALICE: Yes. That's right.
CARL: Sometimes you've just gotta follow your heart. Be bold: Let the rest take care of itself.
CARL: Tell the girls we would have loved to see them, but
DEEDEE: Italy calls! And Greece! We're even thinking of hitting Turkey! Imagine! We'll send you postcards.
ALICE: Enjoy every second of it!
DEEDEE: You, too, honey!
CARL: Bon voyage! The car pulls away, Carl and Deedee turning in their seats to wave at Alice through the rear window. Alice waves until they are out of sight and slowly lowers her hand, standing alone in the street. A beat. Alice sighs and pulls out her guide book, unfolding a map as she looks up to gather her bearings. She takes in the quiet street, the view of the ocean, then looks back at the map in her hands. She straightens up, a new look of purpose on her face, and crosses the street to toss her guide book and map in the trash can on the corner, striking out unaided down a narrow twisting street hung with vines and flowers.
ALICE: is Go. Go home.
EMILE: Just one. He leads her to a table along the wall and holds out a chair. Seated, Meg follows him with her eyes to the kitchen where Bernard works furiously at the stove, tossing the contents of a sauce pan with an expert flick of his wrist. Bernard glances out to the dining room, seeming to sense Meg before knowing he'll find her there.
MEG: Just one. He leads her to a table along the wall and holds out a chair. Seated, Meg follows him with her eyes to the kitchen where Bernard works furiously at the stove, tossing the contents of a sauce pan with an expert flick of his wrist. Bernard glances out to the dining room, seeming to sense Meg before knowing he'll find her there.
GIORGIO: Where is Meg? I do not see her.
EMMA: No. I. I don't think she's 0 coming. I'm sorry.
PHOTOGRAPHER: Cordelia! There she is! Cordelia! The trio of paparazzi putter alongside in a small boat, peppering the yacht with their camera flashes. Emma looks out at them, without her usual animation.
NIKOLAI: Ty v poryadke? Emma turns to find Nikolai standing beside her in white tie, a piece of cake extended in one hand, a fork in the other. Emma's eyes light up as if a switch has been thrown and the flash of a camera records her huge, dazzling smile.
EMMA: He bows slightly, offering the cake.
NIKOLAI: Ya sa-meey shas-li-veey che-lo-vek na zem-le, pa-ta-mu chto u me-nya yest' tee. Emma hangs on every incomprehensible word.
EMMA: Oh, Niki. I'm so glad you found Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 81.
MEG: Seamus. He's ten. Built a website for his fourth grade class. Now he's got actual clients. And that's Finn, the prima ballerina. She'll be six in June Emile examines photographs of Seamus and Charlotte from Meg's wallet while she refills their glasses at the kitchen table and Bernard works at the stove.
EMILE: Elle est coquin, oui?
MEG: Oh, she's no chicken. She's not scared of anything
BERNARD: ( LAUGHS )
MEG: No idea where she gets that. Meg lifts her glass with a sly smile as Bernard brings plates of food to the table.
ALICE: I'm open! I'm open! Alice sails down the makeshift soccer field as one of the kids passes the ball to her, chased by the others. She dodges and kicks the ball through the goal to score. Her "team" jumps and cheers, as do a collection of spectators who have gathered to watch this tall red headed woman in a summer dress racing around the dusty lot with a band of kids.
BERNARD: But, she is perfectly safe.
MEG: Yeah. No. No way. Bernard straddles a beat up moped, motor running, as Meg shakes her head emphatically.
BERNARD: I can not take you, if you will not get on.
MEG: What do you want me to tell you? I'm not getting on that thing. Bernard fixes her with a level look, which Meg mimics.
BERNARD: ( AMIABLY )
MEG: Hold on.
MEG: How do you say "faster?"
IS: ( CONTINUED )
BERNARD: The best chefs of Monte Carlo. They come here to drink and show off. The end of every night. HENRI ( 60's, a bear in chef's whites ) lumbers towards them.
HENRI: No! No! No! We are only cooks allowed here!
BERNARD: Ah, but, this is why we've come! I have finally found someone who can teach you how to cook!
HENRI: ( turns to the table ) A chef from America! Come to flip INT./EXT. CAR - NIGHT - MOVING Jean-Pierre drives an open silver sports car full of PARTY GOERS down the twisting streets, when he sees the commotion and crowd around the dirt lot. Then he spots Alice running-around.
ALICE: I'm up! I'm up! Let's go! She sets off down the field with the kids.
EMMA: It doesn't seem fair. Leaving you to clean up all alone.
NIKOLAI: Ya ryadom.
EMMA: It must get kind of lonely sometimes. Not being understood.
NIKOLAI: ( HEAVILY ACCENTED )
EMMA: ( SOFTLY )
ALICE: That seems a shame.
ALICE: To Dubai. I leave the day after. What is today? Friday? I leave tomorrow. You could come too. You
ALICE: But. Jean-Pierre. ( a near confession ) You don't know me.
ALICE: Before this, I'd never even been to Jean-Pierre blinks and Alice laughs, as much at herself.
ALICE: But, thank you. She turns and opens the door with her key as Jean-Pierre smiles ruefully.
RICHARD: Excusez-moi.I'm looking for the train. To Monte Carlo. Behind him, Cordelia strides through a set of doors to stop directly at Richard's back as she searches the terminal and hisses into her cellphone.
CORDELIA: Yes, Daddy, I'm here. No, I do not see a driver. Yes, I am looking! The attendant points over Richard's shoulder to an exit. Richard begins to turn in Cordelia's direction, but the attendant corrects him, pointing the other way.
RICHARD: He picks up Alice's suitcase and heads off just as a UNIFORMED DRIVER approaches Cordelia.
DRIVER: Mademoiselle Scott?
CORDELIA: Where have you been? The driver leads her away, neither she nor Richard having taken note of the nearby newsstand and its display of today's front page: Emma on the yacht wearing Cordelia's necklace.
ME G: Well, this is me. Back to the old Grimaldi suite.
BERNARD: ( WITH REGRET )
MEG: Thank your father for me?
BERNARD: I will, Meg.
MEG: Thank you. Meg hugs him briefly, awkwardly, then turns for the steps.
BERNARD: Goodbye, Meg. Meg stops, holds a beat with her back to Bernard. Then she turns and marches to him with purpose, seizing his face in both her hands and kisses him passionately. She releases Bernard, who staggers against the moped, catching himself just before going over, as she turns again for the steps, an enormous smile on her face.
IS: INT. HOTEL DE PARIS - SUITE - DAY Alice sits on the edge of the bed with the hotel phone, idly looking out at the sparkling bay and anchored boats.
ALICE: ( leaving a message ) Well, I wish you were there. Or here. I wish you were here, Richard. I do. Because I keep thinking, no matter what I see, I'm only seeing half of it. Because we're not seeing it together. Meg lets herself in the front door and heads for the bedroom, stopping when she overhears Alice on the phone.
MEG: ( SOFTLY )
ALICE: Oh. Hey ( taking Meg in ) Hey! You bought the jeans! They look great!
MEG: ( tearful, comic ) Alice, I am so sorry! For what I said. About you. And Richard. I didn't mean any of it! I love you. I don't know how I would've gotten through the past six months if it weren't for you
ALICE: No. It's okay. You were right ( bursts into tears ) Oh, Meg! I made a huge mistake!
MEG: Richard asked me to marry him
ALICE: Richard asked me to marry him
MEG: Wait. What? When?
ALICE: I told him we should wait a week!
MEG: No. You didn't
ALICE: I did! He surprised me!
MEG: I'd imagined him asking me a million times, but then when he did, I just panicked. suddenly all
ALICE: I'd imagined him asking me a million times, but then when he did, I just panicked. suddenly all
MEG: But, Alice. You were going. We were on our way.
ALICE: I thought he was asking me to make a choice. But, he wasn't. He wasn't doing that at all. It was me. Because I couldn't believe he loved me just for who I was. France or no.
MEG: Honey, Richard knows you. It might feel like it's over. But, it's not.
ALICE: ( CRYING )
EMMA: ( hands off paper ) Thanks. I couldn't find. I musta left my key someplace. ( on a cloud ) But, what does it matter, really? When I already have everything I'll ever need. Alice exchanges a look with Meg as Emma swans across the suite to tear open on the fruit basket, pluck out an apple, and drape herself across a chaise.
MEG: I'm trying to follow you
EMMA: I'm in love! I am! Oh, you guys, I'm in love with Niki. Nikolai. Nikolai. And, I don't care if he is just a busboy. Or waiter. Whatever he is. Alice unfolds the paper, taking in the image of Emma wearing Cordelia's necklace.
ALICE: I thought we said no jewelry
EMMA: No? What jewelry?
MEG: Alice holds up the newspaper.
EMMA: Ooh, that's a good one!
ALICE: The necklace, Emma! Emma's face clouds as she distractedly reaches a hand to her bare collar bone, then flicks her eyes up to Alice.
EMMA: The yacht! There! I left it on!
MEG: Are you kidding me?!
EMMA: Oh, hey. What's she doing here?
DESK CLERK: Mademoiselle Scott! Cordelia looks at him with typical, withering disdain.
CORDELIA: The driver was late. The clerk's smile falters, fades.
CORDELIA: ( ANSWERING )
CORDELIA: Beijing? Oh, I want to come! Will you wait for me?
CORDELIA: I can be there in, say, a day
CORDELIA: ( INTO PHONE )
CORDELIA: ( INTO PHONE )
CORDELIA: He nods, not quite with his hand out, but waiting.
MEG: They're locked!
ALICE: Emma, help.
MEG: You're first. There's a door on
ALICE: You're first. There's a door on
THE ROOF: The roof?!
EMMA: The roof?!
MEG: Why'd they have to park so far out, One point five million Euros, Emma!
ALICE: One point five million Euros, Emma!
EMMA: I said I was sorry! You think I would have worn it if I knew how much it cost? Busy fighting, none of them notice as Nikolai's boat passes fifty feet off their side.
MEG: What am I going to tell my kids?! How am I'm going to explain to Glenn that we're in a French jail?
ALICE: For the auction, Emma!
MEG: My kids'll be in college when we get out! They won't even know me.

EMMA: The necklace!
ALICE: The necklace!

RICHARD: Alice? Who is this guy? Alice breaks Richard's vice grip with a bright smile.
ALICE: I told you, that's Jean-Pierre!
RICHARD: Is there something I need to know? Alice looks at Richard, reading his face, and smiles.
ALICE: No. There's isn't. She leads Richard through the ballroom entrance only to be stopped by an ATTENDANT.
ATTENDANT: Pardon, Monsieur, invitation?
ALICE: He's with me! As Alice pulls Richard through to the ballroom, Nikolai steps to the reception table behind them, producing an elaborate invitation from inside his jacket.
