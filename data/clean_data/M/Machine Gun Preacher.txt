PRISON CORRIDOR - RURAL PENNSYLVANIA - DAY - ( AUGUST/1998 ) And we see SAM CHILDERS coming down a corridor toward us, dressed in jailhouse orange and flanked by a guard. He's stocky, 32 years old, with a biker's handlebar moustache. On the surface he appears good- looking. even handsome if the light is right. but his face is tricky. always changing. behind the quick smile, around his dark eyes, in the taut muscles of his neck we see violence.

DONNIE: You wanna taste? Sam smiles that wicked smile and we go
DONNIE: Right there. With the green light.
DONNIE: Hey, man, you there?! Open up. Donnie KNOCKING again and the door cracks an inch. and we see a black man with a SHAVED HEAD on the other side looking out.
SHAVED HEAD: Fuck are you?
DONNIE: It's me, man, c'mon. Fuckin cold out I don't know you.
SHAVED HEAD: I don't know you.
DONNIE: Yeah you do, man. I saw you the other day. I'm Bobby's friend.

BOOOM!: INT. DOPE HOUSE - SAME DOOR SPLINTERING OPEN! concussion like a fucking pipe bomb wood splintering through the room like shrapnel Sam and Donnie
DONNIE: Don't fuckin move! INSTANT PANDEMONIUM! JUNKIES hopping off the couch, scattering like rats deeper into the house SHAVED HEAD darting out of the room Sam leveling the MOSSBERG in his direction BOOOM! the room flashing like a fucking supernova.

SHAVED HEAD: ( indicating a closet ) In there. Sam KICKS him toward the closet
SAME: Hurry the fuck up. SHAVED HEAD crawling to a small safe in a closet, spins the combo, opens it and pulls out six ounces of uncut cocaine.
SAM: SHAVED HEAD grabs a stack of hundreds, hands it to Sam and CRACKKK! he SLAMS the butt of the Mossberg into SHAVED HEAD'S face and he hits the ground on his back Sam standing over him shoves the barrel of the shotgun into his mouth
DONNIE: C'mon, let's go! But Sam's not moving. just staring down at SHAVED HEAD. and we're watching something here. a terrible intelligence taking over. something bloodless and inhuman coming over Sam in this moment. and he chambers a slug into the shotgun.
SAM: See that nigger's face when I put it in his mouth?
DONNIE: Cook that shit up, man! I wanna hit when I'm going a hundred miles an hour in this Sam juices a needle and spikes Donnie's arm. Donnie feeling the rush. pressing on the gas and howling like a wild man. both of them wired out of their heads. BLASTING down this dark, country road. and then they see.
A HITCHHIKER: Up the road, standing in this bitter cold with his thumb out.
SAM: Look at this sorry fucker.
SAM: Cold enough for ya out there, boy?
DRIFTER: Where you goin, man?

DONNIE: We can take you far as McClure.
DRIFTER: Take me to Dunshore. Sam looking back
SAM: We ain't goin to Dunshore, boy. Said we can drop you at McClure. Suddenly silver flashing A BLADE out of nowhere pressed into Donnie's neck from the backseat the Drifter pulling him tight against the seat rest, pressing it into his throat
DONNIE: What the fuck?!
DRIFTER: Keep drivin! Dunshore or I'll cut his fuckin throat.

DONNIE: SLOW THE FUCK DOWN! But Sam's not letting up. pressing down on the peddle hard. 90. 100. 110 mph Donnie YELLING trying to keep the car on the road MUSIC BLARING like some wild ride to hell and then SAM SUDDENLY JUMPS IN THE BACKSEAT wrestling with the drifter fighting wild elbowing him in the face and somehow the blade is in his hand now and Stick, stick, stick, stick, stick, stick! He stabs him six times in the gut. The drifter HOWLING in pain.

PAIGE: He comin or ain't he?
LYNN: I don't know.
SAM: I don't got no good shoes, Lynn. And she comes into the room, sits on the bed next to him, puts an arm around his shoulder.
LYNN: He don't care what kinda shoes you wearin, baby.
PASTOR KRAUSE: The point of receiving God's word is life. Life upon life. And to accept the blood of Jesus is life upon life upon Praise be to God!
CONGREGATION: Praise be to God!
PASTOR KRAUSE: He breathes his spirit into darkness and makes something good. He sees our shadow and says, `let there be light!"
CONGREGATION: PASTOR KRAUSE
PASTOR KRAUSE: . now proclaim his saving grace! If there are sinners here looking for God raise your hands! A few hands shoot up
FRONT ALTAR: And now we see Sam on his knees in the baptismal tank. The water almost up to his waist. Pastor Krause kneeling behind him.
OMITTED: EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY - ( JUNE/1999 ) Months later and the snow has thawed. it's summer. and we see Sam with other CONSTRUCTION WORKERS finishing their day, packing up their tools, cleaning up. We notice that his gaunt cheeks have filled out and he looks healthier. And now a CONTRACTOR comes up to Sam, hands him a check.
CONTRACTOR: Thanks for your help, Sam.
SAM: You need me to stay on, I can.
CONTRACTOR: We're movin inside next week.
SAM: I can drywall, tile, whatever you got. Know my way round some electrical too.
CONTRACTOR: Sorry, Sam, I gotta cut the crew. Just ain't enough work.
SAM: She asleep?
LYNN: Think so, in our bed. she's funny.
SAM: Job's done.
LYNN: I thought that was goin through August? Sam shakes his head, and they're quiet. both of them sitting here on these steps. the burden of this life catching up to them in this moment.
WOMAN: I got somethin in Pitt, but you gotta have some college for that.
SAM: I'm a hard worker and I learn real fast.
WOMAN: But you got no education, Mr. Childers.
MECHANIC: . don't deal bikes. Probably have a better shot if you take it over to Pitt. Or maybe down to Philly.

DONNIE: Ahhh, shit, man. Shoulda come to yer ole buddy first. Donnie smiling, inviting him back into this world. And we're watching Sam, threshold moment here, considering.
SAM: Sorry I'm late.
LYNN: Somethin will come through. I promise. And we hold on Sam, his troubled eyes. Completely out of options. And we see that for this man the inability to provide for his family is crushing.
LYNN: Two touched down near Harrisberg.
SAM: Come on! Let's go. Lynn following him
SAM: Get Paige, grab a blanket. Lynn darting into a bedroom, scooping Paige out of her bed.
LYNN: ( yelling, over the wind ) What are you doing?! He kicks a hole in the planks, turns to Lynn and Paige
SAM: GET IN! Paige crawling through the opening. into a shallow trench underneath the trailer. Lynn squeezing in behind her. Sam staying outside. no room for him. the trailer starting to buck VIOLENTLY in the tempest. thin walls contorting around him. . and Paige starts to cry terrified Sam laying down on the floor next to the opening, close enough so she can hear his voice.

CONTRACTOR: Tried to ring ya but your phones down.
SAM: Tried to ring ya but your phones down.
CONTRACTOR: Tried to ring ya but your phones down.
SAM: Sam climbs down, moves to the truck, shakes his hand.
CONTRACTOR: Looks like ya made it through pretty We're alright.

LYNN: What are you doin, Sam Childers? Months later and we're with Lynn and Paige, their eyes shut, as Sam leads them both by the hand.
PAIGE: I wanna peek.
SAM: Keep em closed. Sam finally stops them.
PAIGE: Where are we?
SAM: We're home, little girl. REVERSE to see a modest two bedroom house at the end of this driveway. Their new home.
PAIGE: That's ours?
SAM: Sure is. Go check it out. Paige sprints for the house as Lynn hugs Sam, softly starts to cry into his shoulder.
LYNN: It's beautiful.
SAM: That's everything.
LYNN: You get what's in the trunk?
SAM: Lynn looking up, seeing how dirty Sam is from the move.

LYNN: You gimme a little shake. She snaps him again and he feels the sting.
SAM: C'mon, Lynn. She snaps him again but he grabs her and they fall into each other against the counter. laughing. and he kisses her. playful at first and then it becomes more passionate. and just as it starts to lead somewhere we go.
PASTOR KRAUSE: Today we are blessed with a special guest. It's my pleasure to welcome Pastor Relling from the Kilangire Christian Ministry in Uganda, Africa. Pastor. Polite applause as a tall, white South African man named PAUL RELLING steps up to the pulpit, and in a deep Afrikaner accent he
BEGINS: Thank you Pastor Krause, and thank you brothers and sisters for inviting me into this house of the Lord.
RELLING: Thank you Pastor Krause, and thank you brothers and sisters for inviting me into this house of the Lord.
LYNN: Paige, go get some more beans. Paige heads to the kitchen.
SAM: Thinking about Africa. Paige comes back in carrying the beans.
PAIGE: They have tigers over there?
SAM: ( JOKINGLY )
LYNN: What about Africa?
SAM: Just thinkin bout that fella today.
PAIGE: He talked funny.
LYNN: Just from a different place than us, baby, that's all.
SAM: Was thinkin maybe I'd go over there. Help em out fer a few weeks.
DAISY: To see the tigers.
PAIGE: To see the tigers.
SAM: He was talkin about puttin box beam roofs on school houses over there.
LYNN: What about finishing that job in Boswell?
SAM: I'll only be gone a few weeks. Be back before you know it.
SAM: You Ugandan Army or what?
DENG: What's that?
SAM: What's that?
DENG: Sudanese People's Liberation Army. We are freedom fighters.
SAM: Name's Sam Childers.
DENG: I am Deng. There is a certain reserved nobility in this man, in the way he carries himself and speaks. An unwavering strength and self-reliance born from a lifetime of war and struggle.
SAM: ( re: Deng's weapon ) Givin ya problems?
DENG: Yes. A bit.
SAM: Lemme have a look. Deng hesitates, then hands his AK over to Sam who pops the mag out and studies it.
DENG: Lemme have a look. Deng hesitates, then hands his AK over to Sam who pops the mag out and studies it.
SAM: Lemme have a look. Deng hesitates, then hands his AK over to Sam who pops the mag out and studies it.
DENG: Thank you.
SAM: No problem.
DENG: Are you military?
SAM: No, not me. I ain't the military type. Ain't so good with bein told what to do.
DENG: When did you learn about weapons? Sam considers the question for a moment. then simply says.
SAM: Long time ago. Different life.
DAN: Some of us are going into Kampala tomorrow night. Find ourselves a little fun this weekend. You in?
SAM: I was thinkin bout goin up north.
DAN: You crazy? There's a civil war going on up there.
SAM: I know.
SAM: Hey, Deng, you wanna Coke? Sam offers him a can and he takes it.
DENG: Thank you.
SAM: Got a question for ya.
DENG: I wanna go into Sudan this weekend. Need someone to show me around. You The others are going into Kampala.
SAM: I wanna go into Sudan this weekend. Need someone to show me around. You The others are going into Kampala.
DENG: The others are going into Kampala.
SAM: That ain't my speed no more. I wanna see some country. Deng looks at him, surprised by the request.
DENG: You want to see?
SAM: They always drive this fast?
DENG: Traveling is the most dangerous time in Sudan. If the rebels find you on the open road it would be very bad. An awkward silence as Deng stares out the window. Sam wanting to connect here, but Deng is reticent.
SAM: You got kids, Deng?
DENG: No. I have no children.
SAM: Where you from?
DENG: A little village called Aweil. Many hours from here.
SAM: That's where your family is? And Deng simply says.
DENG: My family was killed by LRA.
DENG: The Muslim North has tried to kill the Christian South for 30 years. Two million have lost their lives. Deng sweeping his hand, indicating the mass of refugees.
DENG: Cholera and Malaria are everywhere, there is little food and not enough UN soldiers to protect everyone. Even here they worry the LRA will attack at night. And another SPLA soldier comes up to Deng
DENG: ( ARABIC ) SPLA SOLDIER 1 ( ARABIC )
DENG: I'm sorry, Sam. I'll be five minutes.
SAM: Course, do what you gotta do. Deng leaves and now Sam is completely alone, taking in this mire of humanity all around him. And suddenly there's COMMOTION! two aid workers coming into this tent carrying a WOMAN on a stretcher. One of the aid workers looking around a white woman mid 30's her name is AGNETE CLOSSON, Regional Director of Doctors Without Borders. She sees Sam across the tent.
AGNETE: Excuse me. You. Can you help please? Sam moving to her
SAM: What happened to her face?
AGNETE: The rebels cut off her lips because she argued. These are Kony's orders.
SAM: Who's Kony? Agnete, suddenly suspicious, takes an appraising look of Sam.
AGNETE: Who are you with?
SAM: I'm with Deng over there.
AGNETE: What organization are you with?
SAM: Working with a Christian group down South. Just up here takin a look around, seein a bit of the country.
AGNETE: This isn't a tourist destination, this is a war zone. You stay in this area, you'll be killed.
DENG: Some say Joseph Kony is a wizard. A shapeshifter. He calls himself a He pulls a baggy of tobacco from his pocket and begins to roll a . but I say he is Satan, who devours his own people.
SAM: Kony is the leader of the LRA?
DENG: He is the one we have been fighting for years. But there is very little we can do. Our weapons are old, and our boots are full of holes. We have been forgotten by the rest of the world. And now Deng turns to Sam.
SAM: S'cuse me?
DENG: What are you looking for in this place?
SAM: Ain't lookin for nuthin. Deng staring at him, skeptical.
DENG: And then you will get your picture and go back to your life and all this will just be a story you tell your friends.
DENG: They are night commuters. They come from deep in the bush. Their parents send them out because it is safer to sleep here than in their own homes.
SAM: Because death comes at night in the villages and refugee camps. And we continue to watch this great migration of children. now streaming into this town. a few of them finding a dark corner just below us. unrolling their reed mats. huddling up against each other for the long night.
DENG: Because death comes at night in the villages and refugee camps. And we continue to watch this great migration of children. now streaming into this town. a few of them finding a dark corner just below us. unrolling their reed mats. huddling up against each other for the long night.
DENG: ( CALLING AFTER )
SAM: Get up. let's go. The children looking up, surprised to see a white man here.
DENG: What are you doing?
SAM: They ain't sleepin out here. Tell em they're comin inside. ( to children on the ground ) Ya'll get up. let's go. And Sam starts to move up the block further, wanting to gather up more children, but Deng stops him.
DENG: Sam, there are too many. And he looks up the street and we see more children here than we thought. hundreds of young kids huddled on the streets.
SAM: I can help these here.
DENG: ( ARABIC )
DENG: The LRA attacked a village last night. Sam looking up to him.
BOOOOM!: A muffled burst in the distance Sam, Deng, and the other soldiers running out of the village toward the explosion.
PAIGE: You see any tigers over there?
SAM: Naw, didn't see no tigers.
PAIGE: But they do have them over in Africa.
SAM: So I hear, but not where I was.
PAIGE: Sure am glad you're home.
SAM: Me too, bug.
PAIGE: I'm thinkin of a plane.
SAM: It's late, you better get to bed. And he grabs her and carries her into the bedroom, plops her onto the bed.
PAIGE: C'mon, plane. I'm thinkin of a plane. Sam giving in, playing their little game as she gets under the You said plane, I'm thinkin of a train.
SAM: You said plane, I'm thinkin of a train.
PAIGE: You said train, I'm thinkin of a brain.
SAM: You said brain, I'm thinkin of a.
PAIGE: Ok, you got me.
SAM: Ok, you got me.
PAIGE: You coulda said drain, or mane. like horse's hair. Sam bending over, kissing her forehead.
SAM: Sweet dreams, bug.
LYNN: You comin to bed?
SAM: In a bit
LYNN: You ok?
SAM: Just a long flight. She senses more but knows this man well enough not to push. and so she simply turns away.
LYNN: Baby, whatcha doin? He looks up.
SAM: Makin plans.
LYNN: You been to bed yet? He gathers up a couple of the papers, moves to her.
SAM: I had a vision last night, Lynn. Crazy as it sounds, God spoke to me. He hands her a sheet of paper CU to see it's a crude drawing of I'm gonna build a church.
LYNN: A church?
SAM: Right across the street. Not like Faith United or Calvary Fellowship. Place that ain't gonna turn you away if you a drug addict or a prostitute or whatever. Place for sinners, just like me, who wanna hear the word of God. Lynn studying him, trying to judge how serious he is here. And Sam looking back at her, his eyes like we haven't seen them before. How we gonna pay for a church, Sam?
LYNN: How we gonna pay for a church, Sam?
SAM: We got money in the bank. Business is good. Besides, I own a construction I'm gonna give us one heck of a good deal on the build. She smiles, shaking her head, catching his enthusiasm.
LYNN: Yer crazy.
SAM: `Lil bit.
LYNN: What's that? He hands her the other paper CU to see it's a another drawing.
SAM: That's the orphanage I wanna build. In EXT. RURAL ROAD - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - DAY - ( MAY/2003 ) Eight months later and we're looking at a simple, cinder block church which is under construction. A scattering of pickup trucks parked at the site and a flurry of activity. WORKMEN pouring cement, laying sheetrock, etc. And Sam in the middle of this crew, putting the finishing touches on a timber frame which is about to be raised.
SAM: That's me. The Biker extends his hand, they shake.
BIKER: Hey bro, Ben Hobbes, knew each other long time ago.
SAM: Yeah, Ben, how you doin?
DAUGHTER: Daddy, I'm gonna go.
BIKER: OK, sweetie. She runs off.
SAM: Sure do.
BIKER: Hey, nuthin fer nuthin, Sam, but rumor has it you was puttin up a chapel over there in Central City.
SAM: That's right. Gonna minister to anybody who's lookin for The Lord.
BIKER: That's good, man. Maybe you can do somethin bout your old friend, Donnie.
SAM: What about em?
BIKER: He ain't doin so good, bro. But hey, good seein ya' man.
SAM: I'm here for that boy right there. You gonna get in the way a that? A TENSE BEAT not sure how this is gonna go and then the CRACKHEAD shakes his head "no"
DONNIE: I can't do this.
SAM: Look at me. God don't make trash, boy. Now he ain't givin up on you, so don't give up on him, you hear me? And somehow Donnie finds strength in his words, and in Sam's hand touching his head, and he nods.
DONNIE: Welcome to Shekinah Fellowship Church.
LYNN: It's five-til and he still ain't here. Sam hearing this, moving to his feet, toweling off his hands.
SAM: You call him?
DAISY: You like this dress, Sam?
SAM: What, mom?
DAISY: You ain't never seen this one. I bought it a long time ago. Been keepin it for a special occasion.
SAM: It's nice.
DAISY: I never told you this but when I was pregnant with you, now this was way back, probably 1960, when yer daddy and I was still in Grand Rapids, a Pastor prophesied over me. Pulled me right up on stage and laid his hands on my belly and told me I was gonna have a Preacher for a ( smiling at the thought ) Yer daddy and I were so proud.

DAISY: Yes you are. You were born to it. Just took you a little ways to get here.
SAM: ( to the band ) Thank you, Tommy. You boys is soundin pretty good up here. Sam turning to the crowd, clearing his throat, clearly nervous.

DENG: Small penis. And Deng smiles brightly. Sam realizing he's been played. And Deng starts to LAUGH. A deep, guttural, infectious laugh. Sam joining him, and we sense that at this moment these two have become friends. And gradually their laughter subsides, and it's quiet again.
SAM: Can I ask you a question?
DENG: Of course.
SAM: You believe in God? Deng considering this for a beat, and then.
DENG: I was raised to believe there was a God in heaven.

And now the women begin to move in unison. singing an ancient Acholi song as one of the older orphan boys beats a small drum in They are saying that fire brings strength and ashes abundance.

SAM: I think that old `78 broke down five times on that trip.
DONNIE: Sounds about right. Shoot, we had more fun tryin to get there than when we finally did. Sam and Donnie share a laugh.
SAM: I'm glad I'm walkin with the Lord and all, but sometimes I ain't sure I'm gonna be able to do what he wants me to do.

Sam, Lynn, and Paige taking it all in. starting to sense the dimensions of this massive house. the waiters in their pressed jackets offering them food. the extravagance. like nothing they've ever seen. . Bill pulling Sam off from the crowd so it's just the two of them. taking an envelope from his jacket and handing it to him.
SAM: Thank you, Bill.
BILL: Forget it. Now c'mon, can I get ya a mojito or somethin?
LYNN: Why we leavin so soon? Shannon appearing in the doorway in the b.g., calling after.
PAIGE: Why we leavin so soon? Shannon appearing in the doorway in the b.g., calling after.
SHANNON: Everything alright?. Lynn turning to respond, but Sam keeps her moving forward, down the driveway, past the line of parked BMW's and Mercedes to their truck at the curb.
SAM: Get in the car.
LYNN: What's wrong? As they load into the truck.
SAM: Sonuvabitch is cryin pour-mouth to me and he's livin in the damn Taj Mahal.
LYNN: I asked him for five-thousand dollars to feed a buncha motherless babies and you know what he gave me? ( taking out the check, wadding it up ) Hundred and fifty bucks. That's it. Handed it to me like it was gold bouillon! Sonuvabitch spent more than that on salsa for his party.
SAM: I asked him for five-thousand dollars to feed a buncha motherless babies and you know what he gave me? ( taking out the check, wadding it up ) Hundred and fifty bucks. That's it. Handed it to me like it was gold bouillon! Sonuvabitch spent more than that on salsa for his party.
LYNN: What are you doin?
SAM: I've had it with these people and all their bullshit about wantin to help. And he starts pulling out weapons. shotguns and assault rifles. stuffing them into an oversize gun bag.
LYNN: Sam Childers.
SAM: Stay outta my way. And for the first time in years this woman is scared. He lets go of her wrist and continues to fill the bag and we go
SHOP OWNER: . I'm sorry, twenty-five hundred is the best I can do for them gun. REVERSE to see Lynn's car parked at the curb, Sam pointing to it.

NINETEEN: ( ARABIC )
SAM: Who's this guy?
DENG: That's our leader.
SAM: John Garang? Deng nods as we go.
GARANG: They call you Preacher. Is this what I should call you?
SAM: Sam is fine.
GARANG: I hear what you have done for the SPLA and I am grateful.
SAM: We can thank God for his blessins.
GARANG: Yes, we can. How many children do you look after, Sam?
SAM: Couple hundred with us here. Feed another thousand a day from nearby villages. Anyone who shows up hungry gets a meal. And they continue through the camp. A few of the children running up to Garang, touching the cuff of his shirt, then sprinting away.
GARANG: What you are doing is noble, but too dangerous. I must advise you to stop risking your life in our struggle.
SAM: Until someone starts fightin for these children, I'm the one that's gonna do it.
GARANG: You are stubborn, aren't you?
SAM: As a mule. Garang smiling, an instant affinity for this man.
GARANG: You and I come from very different worlds, but we are not so dissimilar. And another child runs up to Garang, touching him, and then sprints away giggling.
SAM: Talkin bout peace in a room somewhere is a waste of time. You gotta go out and make it.
GARANG: You are correct, but we must fight them at every level. Part of my battle is waged in those rooms. We must talk of peace, but keep our rifles ready for war. Sam turning to him, coming to an understanding here. Realizing that both of them are warriors in the same fight.
DONNIE: You say prayers or somethin?
PAIGE: Already did.
DONNIE: Ok then, sweet dreams.
PAIGE: Ain't you gonna read me a book?
DONNIE: Ahh, Paige, you know I don't read so Then let's play a game.

DONNIE: Dad usually kisses me on the forehead before he leaves. You can do that.
PAIGE: Dad usually kisses me on the forehead before he leaves. You can do that.
DONNIE: Sure I can. And Donnie does just that, bends down and kisses Paige on the Sweet dreams. And now we see Lynn in the hallway having just witnessed this through the cracked door, keenly feeling Sam absence in this moment.
SAM: Keep em closed! A little bit more!
BETTY: ( ARABIC )
ROSE: ( stern, Arabic ) Michael! Cover your eyes! No peeking!
SAM: . keep comin'. The children inching forward, following his voice, until.
BETTY: ( ARABIC )
DENG: Some of the child soldiers say there is a bounty on your life. That Kony is offering money for your nose and ears. Sam, no reaction, just keeps swinging the children.
SAM: He ain't the first old-boy who wanted to see my head hanging on his wall. Keep yer soldiers where they're needed. I can take care of myself. Deng clearly worried for his friend, but doesn't press the issue. And now Sam notices William off from the group, sitting on the ground by himself, not playing.
DENG: All we know is that his family was killed and that he and his brother were taken into the LRA.
SAM: Where's the brother?
DENG: Nobody knows.
NEW ANGLE: Sam approaching William, kneeling down next to him.
SAM: Hey buddy, you don't wanna play with the other kids? William, no response.
SAM: I don't see nuthin. Deng checking a handheld GPS unit
DENG: This is it.
SAM: Hold on. . and we see what he sees CHILDREN hiding behind a bush.
SAM: Deng, tell camp we're comin back with two. A.J., Nineteen go get them kids. A.J. and Nineteen move off as Sam pops the rear hatch on the SUV and pulls out a MEDICAL BAG.
SAM: What's he sayin?
DENG: A.J. is dead.
SAM: ( BEAT )
DENG: ( yelling to Nineteen, Arabic ) Don't move!
SAM: Ask him if he saw the shooter.
DENG: ( yelling to Nineteen, Arabic ) Did you see him?! Nineteen responds.
SAM: You got `em?

DONNIE: They're good. Paige cooked us all dinner the other night. Chocolate-chip pancakes.
SAM: By herself, huh?
DONNIE: Yep. I helped her with the stove is all. She did everything else. Pretty good too. And now we see Donnie's DOPE WORKS sitting on the table in front of him. He's using again.
SAM: Goin fine.
DONNIE: Hey, maybe I'll come with you one of these trips. I'd like to get outta here for a spell. See what it's like.
SAM: Sounds good. And it's silent between them. both of these men lost in their own worries for a moment. and then.
DONNIE: Ask you a question?
SAM'S VOICE: DONNIE'S VOICE
DONNIE'S VOICE: You think God will forgive us for the things we've done? And we're watching Sam, this question hitting him like a freight train. Unable to answer.
AGNETE: In the camps. The children. They say there is a white preacher who hunts the LRA. This place does not need more killing, Mr. Childers.
SAM: I'm just tryin to help these people. Same as you.
AGNETE: War upon war does not fix what is broken here. The history of this country is filled with righteous killers. That is how it always begins, with men thinking they are killing for the right reasons.
SAM: I got a 200 kids who are gonna sleep safe tonight and wake up tomorrow mornin to a bowl of hot food. Right or not, that's all the reason I need.
AGNETE: And what about the rumors I have heard about you supplying weapons to the SPLA? Sam turning to her, face-to-face, starting to get pissed.
SAM: You fight the evil in this place your way, I'll fight it mine.
AGNETE: Do not delude yourself, Mr. Childers. You're a mercenary, not a humanitarian. Sam, finished with this conversation, slams the lift-gate closed on the truck and starts to climb in.

SAM: What's goin on?
DENG: An LRA convoy has moved north over the border. They're heading for Ed Duim.
SAM: That's where they sell em on the black market, ain't it?
DENG: Far ahead we see three sets of HEADLIGHTS coming towards us on the road just bouncing white dots on the horizon and silently they begin to check their mags and weapons preparing for battle and the headlights get closer Deng not slowing down and we realize we are on a collision course with this convoy and finally we see MUZZLE FLASHES in the distance and
SAM: Let's go! Sam and Nineteen leaning through the open windows as Deng drives leveling their AK's and firing
KRAKAKAKAKAK! KRAKAKAKAKAK!: And now the approaching convoy LIGHTS UP with RETURN FIRE! Sam and Nineteen hanging out the windows blasting back Deng stepping on the gas, accelerating toward the convoy like some hellish game of "chicken"( reminiscent of Sam and Donnie's wild ride with the Drifter in scene #29 ) and we watch as the headlights barrel towards us at full bore BULLETS POPPING across the windshield of the truck SAM AND NINETEEN IN CONSTANT FIRE MODE THE SOUND DEAFENING headlights blown out on both trucks and now we're plunged into total blackness - - only the wild-strobe of machine gun fire lighting up the night as these trucks slam towards each other and finally

DENG: ( ARABIC )
SAM: Put her in the truck. And Sam continues with the group. assessing each child's health. tenderly running his hands over their broken, starved bodies. somehow calculating which ones are worse off and pulling them out of . and he reaches the last child and we see that the SUV is now PACKED with children. huddled into every available corner. 10 children in total. There's no more room.
DENG: ( ARABIC )
SAM: Let's go! ( to the children, holding up

SAM: I want you to look at this. See that? Twelve year old boy had both his arms cut off by LRA. An employee approaches the bank manager with something to sign, looks down at the photos. The Bank Manager becoming uncomfortable.
BANK MANAGER: Sam. It's not necessary.
SAM: Look at this John, when we found this little girl her breasts had been hacked Bank Manager not looking at the photograph.
BANK MANAGER: Sam, this isn't necessary.

SAM: Most of you want me to stand up here and make some sense outta this. That's why you come here today. You want me to tell you that God has his plan for all of us, and when he wants to call us back home he's gonna do it.
PAIGE: Mom, who are those men? THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD we see a FLATBED TRUCK parked next to the house and 7 or 8 MOVERS pulling heavy machinery out of the barn.
LYNN: S'cuse me, what are you doing?
MOVER: Loadin up. And she makes her way into.
LYNN: Hey, s'cuse me. And now she sees Sam going through a cabinet in the back.
SAM: Ain't ours no more. Best go through and make sure they ain't takin nuthin that belongs in the house.
LYNN: And she sees two men start to dismantle the "Childers Construction Company" sign that she painted herself years ago

SAM: It's all done, so save yer breath. where's the keys to the safe? Sam grabs papers from the counter and hands them to Lynn. She quickly pages through them, can't believe what she's reading.
LYNN: You sold the business for $27,000?
SAM: I need a new truck for the orphanage.
LYNN: A new truck? You sold our business for a new truck? Sam finds the Keys.
SAM: What's the combination? What's the fucking combination.
LYNN: Paige's birthday. Sam starts to spin the combination but hesitates.
SAM: What are the numbers?
LYNN: You fight for everyone but us. She moves past him, spinning the combination and cranking open the vault. Sam grabbing a couple stacks of cash.
SAM: You can make it up with the ministry.
LYNN: What ministry?! They see what you've become, Sam. They see how far gone you are. You need to get quiet with The Lord. And he looks to her.
SAM: Fuck the Lord.
LYNN: Don't say that. Don't turn yer back on . He turned his back on me! on Donnie! on every one of them kids over The good you're doin is destroyin this What good have I ever done? Sam standing here, weighing something in his mind. A choice he must make here. and finally he moves past her.
SAM: . He turned his back on me! on Donnie! on every one of them kids over The good you're doin is destroyin this What good have I ever done? Sam standing here, weighing something in his mind. A choice he must make here. and finally he moves past her.

SAM: What good have I ever done? Sam standing here, weighing something in his mind. A choice he must make here. and finally he moves past her.
LYNN: Please don't leave. But he's gone.
DENG: Welcome back. But Sam says nothing, and Deng sees that his eyes are deserted. Inevitable. And Sam moves past him without saying a word.
AGNETE: STOP THE TRUCK! STOP!! The truck grinding to a halt. The driver becoming terrified, trying to jam the truck into reverse
DRIVER: WE ARE GOING TO DIE! THEY WILL KILL You move and they'll shoot! calm down! I will talk to them. Agnete climbing out of the truck as we go
US!: You move and they'll shoot! calm down! I will talk to them. Agnete climbing out of the truck as we go
AGNETE: You move and they'll shoot! calm down! I will talk to them. Agnete climbing out of the truck as we go
AGNETE: It's ok we are a relief convoy Agnete and the LRA LEADER meet in the middle of the bridge
MILITARY: And suddenly the LRA LEADER slams her in the gut with the butt of his rifle and she collapses. The other Rebels swarm all over the convoy, pulling out AID WORKERS and DRIVERS, forcing them onto their knees in a group.
DRIVER: PLEASE DON'T KILL US! On your knees or we will take your legs! Everyone terrified some of them sobbing Agnete looking up, trying to talk to the LRA LEADER
AGNETE: We are only a relief convoy
LRA LEADER: Shut your mouth!
KRATAKRATAKRATAKRAK!!!: A firestorm of lead Sam, Deng, and the rest of his team coming onto the bridge shooting rebels scrambling for cover but it's too late dropping as they try and sprint away and in an instant it's all over. Agnete sees Sam, rushes toward him, but when he looks at her she freezes. He is completely unrecognizable to her in this moment a killer's thousand-yard stare barely human more like a machine than a man. And he moves past her down the bridge, to the LRA LEADER on the ground who is still alive. And he puts the barrel of his rifle against the rebel's head and.
BOOOOM!: He's dead. Just like that. And he continues walking up the bridge. And we see Agnete, Deng and the other soldiers having just witnessed INT. INFIRMARY - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT William coming in quietly, moving next to one of the captured Rebels from the previous scene who is shackled to a bed, injured. Two SPLA soldiers here standing guard.
WILLIAM: ( ARABIC )
DENG: Do you hear that, Preacher?
SAM: There is no more laughter. The children do not play here anymore. They are scared once again.
DENG: There is no more laughter. The children do not play here anymore. They are scared once again.
SAM: I don't need your help. And Sam turns away. After a beat Deng walks off, leaving him alone once again.
WILLIAM: I remember my parents when I sleep. I see them in my dreams sometimes. Sam looking to William. this small boy sitting above him. telling his story.
PAIGE: ( quiet, into phone ) INT. SAM'S TUKUL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT Sam on his sat phone
SAM: Bug? You there?
PAIGE: Yeah, it's me.
SAM: Yeah, it's me.
PAIGE: You ok?
SAM: I'm ok, Bug. And there's a long pause. so much to say but no words to say it. each of them holding their phones to their ears and just listening. and finally Sam says.
PAIGE: You said tree. I'm thinkin of a knee. Sam smiling to himself. and we realize this man is coming back to life when he says.
SAM: You said knee, I'm thinkin of bee.
PAIGE: I love you too, Daddy. Lynn hearing this and tears roll down her cheeks as we go.
WILLIAM: Excuse me.
WILLIAM: Is it true an LRA commander was captured last night? Soldiers nodding their heads "yes."
WILLIAM: Are you going there?
WILLIAM: Can I ride with you?
WILLIAM: I want to ask the commander something.
WILLIAM BOLTS: Sprinting through the bush running for his life rebels see him yelling for him to stop chasing him down shooting their rifles into the air and he hits the ground in the fetal position too terrified to continue eyes clamped shut as 4 or 5 rebels surround him guns pointed at his head caught.
SAM: Have you seen William? Betty shaking her head "no", and we see the worry on Sam's face. intuitively knows something is wrong.
DENG: Some of the soldiers said he was asking about the commander that is being held at Sam closing his eyes, knows instantly what William has done.
SAM: Get em on the phone, see if he's shown up at the base yet.
SOLDIER: He ran from us.
COMMANDER: He is worth nothing with no feet. Put him with the others until tomorrow.
DENG: They have not see the boy.
SAM: Ok. Get Nineteen and Marco we're gonna go look for him.
DENG: It will be light soon. What do you want to do? Sam looking at a topo map on his lap.
SAM: Let's go through Maridi, see if they've seen anything.
DENG: The village outside of Akot says an LRA caravan came through there an hour ago. They were headed for Ed Duim.
WOOOOSH!: An RPG streaks toward the lead LRA truck and KABOOOM! the truck is blown off it's axles the other LRA trucks pulling off the road and suddenly we're in a withering firefight the roar of heavy weapons at full-tilt.
NINETEEN: Sprinting through the bush edging around the LRA trucks finding a position on their weak side and locking an RPG into a launcher shouldering it aiming WOOOOSH! the missile streaking toward the second LRA jeep and
KABOOOM!: It's blasted into the air onto it's side rebels scurrying away from the wreckage still firing an absolute hail of lead AK's barking in every direction
KRATAKRATAKRATAKRATAKRAKKK!: One of the rebels standing up firing an RPG WOOOOOSH! MARCO crouched behind the new orphanage truck firing sees the white streak coming at him dives just as
SAM: Go! Go! Go! Go! And we see Deng coming out of the bush to his right and then Nineteen to his left and they charge on the remaining rebels Sam providing covering fire a curtain of lead cutting through the enemy and just like that it's over Sam waving behind him
DENG: ( to Soldiers, Arabic ) Take them out.
SAM: Cut them loose!
DENG: ( to soldier, Arabic ) Cut the ropes! Sam moves to the second TRANSPORT TRUCK, rips the canvas back to
FIND: 50 MORE CHILDREN SHACKLED IN THE BACK OF THIS TRUCK Holy fuck indeed. He's been here before. 100 kids and he only has one good vehicle. and we watch him standing here. staring at these tiny faces looking back at him. a moment. lost in indecision until one of the kids stands up near the back.
IT'S WILLIAM: Sam sees him and suddenly he knows exactly what he needs to do.
SAM: C'MON, LET'S GO!. get em out of there and line em up! C'MON! And we've seen this before. Sam going through these children. assessing their health. one by one. separating the worse off from the others. forming two group. turning to Deng and Nineteen and motioning to the smaller group ( about 15 children ).
NEW ANGLE: Sam and Marco moving from one dead LRA rebel to the other. rolling them onto their backs. going through their belts. pulling out extra ammo clips and grenades.
NEW ANGLE: At the SUV, now jammed with children. Sam talking to Nineteen, Marco and the others.
NINETEEN: What about you, Preacher?
SAM: ( to the soldiers ) Go on. Get outta here. The soldiers load onto the SUV and drive off, leaving Sam and Deng standing here in the middle of these 85 children. Waiting for the war that will surely come.
THE END: Joseph Kony and his Lord's Resistance Army continue their reign of terror in Sudan and Northern Uganda. Amnesty International estimates that Kony and the LRA are responsible for over 400,000 murders and more than 40,000 child abductions. These children are tortured, raped, sold into sex slavery, and forced to take part in ritualized killing by LRA The Islamic Government of Sudan continues to provide weapons and safe haven to Kony and the LRA as part of a deal to wage a proxy war against the predominately Christian South. Without pressure from the United States, this support will continue and more innocent children will be slaughtered. Now you know.
