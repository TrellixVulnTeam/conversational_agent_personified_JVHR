LUKE: Are you all right?
ALEXA: I'm sorry. I'm from Utah.
LUKE: It's okay.
ALEXA: Are you alone out here?
LUKE: Oh, wow. I'm really sorry.
LUKE: Uh, what is it?

ALEXA: So, this "Survival Quest" is your Yeah. It's my third try. Kind a' lame, huh?
LUKE: Yeah. It's my third try. Kind a' lame, huh?

LUKE: It's just something I really wanted to do.
ALEXA: His shoes. Fishing lures. The electric drill.
LUKE: She smiles, grateful, eyeing his torn t-shirt and shorts.
ALEXA: You're all wet and muddy. Why don't I hang those up to dry?
LUKE: Thanks. I'm okay.
ALEXA: I'm propositioning you.
LUKE: Oh, wow. You are?
JANINE: It's remarkable. Sort of retro. I thought you were gettin' a pickup?
LUKE: I changed my mind.
KEENAN: It's awesome. It's pleather.
LUKE: Fuck you. You think it's stupid.
JANINE: Oh my God. You got laid. Finally! Who is she?
KEENAN: I didn't say a word! I swear! You know Janine. She's got X-ray Camping! A total stranger.

KEENAN: See ya', hottie.
JANINE: Could find something to call me, other than what every guy in the world would say?
KEENAN: "Sweetheart?" "Babe?"
LUKE: Look, I know it's dopey. But don't you recognize it? It's painted and the muffler's switched out, -but this was my dad's.
KEENAN: Ten years. A little dried out.
LUKE: First off, that woman. We didn't go all the way, you know?
KEENAN: Yeah? Okay, so?
LUKE: You think technically I'm still a Were you inside her?

KEENAN: You know enough of my secrets to get me shot. Sharon's mom on Thanksgiving? What the fuck dream is there you can't tell me?
LUKE: It's about part of me gettin' smaller. An important part.
KEENAN: You have gotta' be fuckin' kiddin' me. You're not thirteen!

MAX: No skin off my ass. But a few days, weeks, your whole transmission could blow.
LUKE: Ah, Jeez. I shouldn't got this.
MAX: Four hundred seventy-five horsepower. Twenty-eight inch wheels. It's a classic. Let me dig around out back. Maybe we got a used set.
LUKE: That'd be great. Thanks.
MICHELLE: What's wrong with it?
LUKE: Oh, just needs a new gasket and a couple T-sprocks. The flanges are sheared off. No big deal.
MICHELLE: You have to watch my brother, Max. He's sellin' you "T-sprocks?"
LUKE: There's no such thing. Last week he sold Mrs. Gustafson a whole set: six hundred bucks. My name's From New York. Poli-Sci transfer. I sort of asked around campus.

LUKE: No, Puck Ass, but people just call me Luke. We're beatin' his frat boy team in street hockey. Pisses 'em off.
MICHELLE: I'll talk to Max. Tell him to just replace the gasket.
LUKE: Thanks. So, what do you think? I'll just sit there while you eat. I won't even talk.
MICHELLE: Look, I just split up with this total amoeba.
LUKE: Oh, I'm a paramecium. That's way more evolved. I'm practically pond Maybe I'll give you a call when the truck's ready.

KEENAN: Whoa, first date. Definitely the 'new Luke!'
LUKE: No! On me.
KEENAN: You're startin' to creep me out. Listen, I think I know what's goin' on, okay? "Acute Adolescent Anxiety." It's from the stress of college, girls, grades. It's really common.
LUKE: I'm not an adolescent. Where'd you get this crap?!
KEENAN: The Net. I found all the symptoms right off: panic attacks, "Localized Alopecia" -that's hair loss. This doctor wrote back, "Any chance your friend, Luke, just lost his virginity?"
LUKE: You told, -you gave him my name?!
KEENAN: He's a doctor, back East. He's sending this information pack. Look, I started thinkin' you're goin' bipolar on me or somethin'. Come on, man, BREASTS?!

LUKE: I came to apologize.
MAX: Get out a' here! She's not home, Will you tell her I came by?
LUKE: Will you tell her I came by?
MAX: No. She's honest with you, so you bolt? And then what, you wake up feelin' sorry for her?
LUKE: No! Is that what she thinks? I left 'cause a' what she said? That's crazy! She's like the most incredible girl I ever met!
MAX: Amazes even me, a guy's capacity to be a world-class asshole. Fortunately, I'm familiar with the Will you please just tell her I came by? Forget it. I'll catch up with her on my own.
LUKE: Will you please just tell her I came by? Forget it. I'll catch up with her on my own.

LUKE: Look, I'm gonna' see her again, -if she'll see me. I don't care what the fuck you say about it.
MAX: Oh, really?
LUKE: Yeah, really.
MAX: You get near her, I'll feed your nuts to the neighbor's dog!
LUKE: What kind a' dog is it?
MAX: I mean, is it a pitbull, or what?
LUKE: I mean, is it a pitbull, or what?

SYDNEY: Workin' late, huh? Luke?
LUKE: Yeah, four AM. It sucks.
SYDNEY: Sometimes you guys are just unfathomably stupid.
LUKE: Excuse me?
SYDNEY: Why in the world do guys say "it sucks" as if it were a bad thing? I mean, every guy's dying to get a blow job, right? So, you think they'd treat those words with profound respect, like holy scripture. "What an unbelievable sunset, honey: doesn't it just SUCK?,". "You won an Olympic Gold Medal?!, that BLOWS!"
LUKE: I guess you're right.
SYDNEY: It must be great at your age. That river of testosterone coursing through your veins, the damn about to burst! How about we just lock this place up and go for an Olympic No thanks. Jeez, lady.

LUKE: What's the matter? Don't you like being touched? Don't you like being a guy?
SYDNEY: What's the matter? Don't you like being touched? Don't you like being a guy?
LUKE: No. I mean,. What? Sorry, but you're just bizarre.

LUKE: Holy shit. It's that lady from the store! Grey and black at the bar.

JANINE: We've only been together six months. And he's such a guy's guy, everyone's buddy, but, alcoholic parents, six months in "Juvey."
MICHELLE: Wild past, huh?
JANINE: I think the only reason he's even alive right now, is okay, partly 'cause he's so damn smart, but mostly 'cause there's this one person, he knows, absolutely, no matter what, won't bale on him.
MICHELLE: No. He doesn't trust me at all. Luke. He's a rock.
JANINE: No. He doesn't trust me at all. Luke. He's a rock.

JEREMY: The brunette? You kiddin'? I'd give my left one to be with her.
SYDNEY: Yeah? So could he.
MICHELLE: Your friends sorta' like each other, huh?
LUKE: Super-glue. Thirty seconds together, you can't pull 'em apart.
MICHELLE: How'd they meet?
LUKE: Keenan sold her a bike. I don't think they've been apart more than six hours since.
MICHELLE: You're not s'posed to say that. That's a total pathetic, loser thing to say. But I'm gonna' take it as a huge compliment.
LUKE: Beautiful. Unpretentious. Why'd you say 'yes?'
MICHELLE: Luke sneers, not his favorite compliment.
LUKE: Okay, two words. What're you most passionate about?
MICHELLE: Friendship. Trust. You?

KEENAN: How would he even do that? Go all the way, I mean?
SYDNEY: He's a Z. You become Morphescent when you get turned on. You can change all the way when you have an orgasm.
LUKE: With who?
SYDNEY: I'm available.
LUKE: No way!
SYDNEY: Well, excuse me. Truth is, at this stage, you don't really need anyone
LUKE: Sydney wearily sips a highball. She looks to Keenan for help. Keenan flashes the international sign for jacking off.
SYDNEY: It's a lot to absorb, I know. When you're ready, give me a call. Your first time, you shouldn't be alone.
LUKE: Michelle. And I really like her, dad. But,.
LUKE: I'm not doin' it. I don't care what she says! I can control this I didn't know what was goin' on before. I do now, so, it's not gonna' be a problem. I just need to stay focused!

LUKE: Yeah. I'm fine. Thanks. Perfect.
MICHELLE: ( slightly suggestive )
LUKE: Me too.
JANINE: What is goin' on?!
KEENAN: We just need to be alone. We got a big game tomorrow. Sometimes guys just need to hang with the guys, you know? No distractions?
JANINE: C'mon, Michelle. Let the boys play with their pucks.
LUKE: You TOLD HER?!
KEENAN: I had to. You know Janine. She knew somethin' was up.
JANINE: I've read about this kinda' thing, but I didn't think it was real. It's so cool!
LUKE: It's disgusting!
JANINE: How can you say that? If I had a chance to be a guy for a day, I'd jump at it. Seriously, Keen, wouldn't you want to get inside a girl's body?
LUKE: Not my own! Man, how could you tell her?!
KEENAN: She should be here. It's just weird, two guys alone, one turnin' into a girl.
JANINE: Yeah, I can't wait. Not exactly something you get to see every day.
LUKE: Forget it!
JANINE: What, HE gets to, and I don't!
LUKE: No one gets to!

KEENAN: Does he need any help in there?
JANINE: Not from you.
KEENAN: Alright, okay, now open those little levers on the sides,. and flip that center thingy back.
JANINE: Alright, okay, now open those little levers on the sides,. and flip that center thingy back.

KEENAN: I'm just sayin', he's not that experienced with girls.
JANINE: Oh, and you are?
KEENAN: I'm startin' to wonder if you are?
JANINE: I'm not gonna' feed your fantasies.
LUCA: Don't call me that!
KEENAN: Babe, every time I look at you, I get the shivers! I just want to rip your clothes off, and throw you Oh, Keen!

LUKE: Didn't want anyone around. So, I did what you said.
SYDNEY: Amazing, huh?
LUKE: Weird. Awful.
SYDNEY: Hmm. Was it difficult making the No. It was hard gettin' back. I need an owner's manual.
LUKE: No. It was hard gettin' back. I need an owner's manual.
SYDNEY: A lot of guys could use one of So, what now? Do I take pills or No, it doesn't work like that. This may sound odd, but I need to know if you're attracted to me.
LUKE: So, what now? Do I take pills or No, it doesn't work like that. This may sound odd, but I need to know if you're attracted to me.
SYDNEY: No, it doesn't work like that. This may sound odd, but I need to know if you're attracted to me.
LUKE: What? No.
SYDNEY: Hmm. You're not gay, are you?
LUKE: NO! Jeez! I'm just not attracted to you like that.
SYDNEY: Okay, calm down. This could be a problem. Right now, you can go either way anytime you want. It's a very special and critical time for a Z, something you'll experience only once in life.
LUKE: You need to use this incredible opportunity you've been given, to figure out which you're supposed to be: male or female.
SYDNEY: You need to use this incredible opportunity you've been given, to figure out which you're supposed to be: male or female.
LUKE: Don't you see? You get to choose.
SYDNEY: Don't you see? You get to choose.
LUKE: I don't want to choose. I want to be a guy.
SYDNEY: Yes, well, the thing is, sometimes your desires can conflict with your desires. It's important to know for sure.
LUKE: Believe me, I know.
SYDNEY: I think you need to try again.
LUKE: No way!
SYDNEY: Why're you so resistant? If the truth is, you want to be a guy, great, but if not.
LUKE: Don't even say that!
SYDNEY: Well, clearly some part of you feels differently. You couldn't change if you didn't want to.
LUKE: What?! That's crap!
SYDNEY: That's the thing about the truth. It'll set you free, but first it can really piss you off.
LUKE: This is nuts! I'm supposed to be a Then what's the problem? You are
SYDNEY: Then what's the problem? You are
LUKE: You're not gonna' help?!
SYDNEY: I will, the moment you're ready to try again. You can come back to my place right now if you want.
LUKE: Forget it!
CHAD: Well, ain't we a basket a' Yeah, Luke, what got into you The Force.
JEREMY: Yeah, Luke, what got into you The Force.
LUKE: The Force.
MAX: Hey. Good game.
LUKE: I dropped by your place. Any chance you could give me a few pointers.

LUKE: We were both named after our Uncle. Well, she's cool. Actually, she's hot. I was hopin' maybe you could hook me up.
MAX: Well, she's cool. Actually, she's hot. I was hopin' maybe you could hook me up.
LUKE: Huh? No. Not a chance.
MAX: No! She just wouldn't be She a Lesbian?
LUKE: No! She just wouldn't be She a Lesbian?
MAX: She a Lesbian?
LUKE: No! Of course not. Jesus! She's, -my cousin!
MAX: Yeah, okay. So? Michelle's my sister. You gonna' tell me you wouldn't like to do her?!
LUKE: FUCK YOU, man!
MAX: What is your deal?!
LUKE: You ASSHOLE!
MAX: Keep the fuck away from me! And Michelle too!
LUKE: You can fuck off!
CHAD: What the hell's goin' on?!
KEENAN: ( to the guys ) Luke's datin' his sister.
VARIOUS GUYS: ( recognition ) Oh, you can all fuck off!
LUKE: Oh, you can all fuck off!
JEREMY: This shirt? I've had it for years.
SYDNEY: Well, it's very sexy. I love men's clothes. What else have you got in your closet?
JEREMY: Polly, are you alright? Didn't mean to walk in on you.
POLLY: Oh, hon. I'm fine, thanks. Love, tears. That's the trade-off.
SYDNEY: My God, he's gorgeous.
POLLY: Yes, he's a Michelangelo. And the sweetest boy in the world. Sorry, darling, I'm afraid you'll find he's not your type.
SYDNEY: Oh, we'll see about that.
POLLY: I think he may prefer men.
SYDNEY: I certainly hope so.
JANINE: Is Luke alright?
SYDNEY: He should have full control over this now. Something must be really confusing him. The only thing I can think of.
KEENAN: When he became Luca, was he attracted to one of you? You can get really thrown by that. Janine?
SYDNEY: When he became Luca, was he attracted to one of you? You can get really thrown by that. Janine?
JANINE: No. Not me.
KEENAN: Well, he sure as hell wasn't attracted to me.
JANINE: No. Definitely not.
SYDNEY: Wasn't it just the two of you?
JANINE: Not exactly.
KEENAN: Oh, give me a break! No way! Max?! They just had a huge fight. He tried to beat the crap out of
JANINE: Exactly. He was a girl.
KEENAN: Oh! This is just wrong.
JANINE: Would you rather she was attracted to me?
KEENAN: Would you?!
JANINE: Maybe I would!
SYDNEY: Whoa! HANG ON! Right now, Luke needs your help. He needs to know you're behind him, no matter what he wants.
JANINE: So, what's all this mean?
SYDNEY: Bottom line? Maybe Luca really likes this boy, -enough to want to be female.
JANINE: ( to Keenan ) Don't sneer!
KEENAN: Oh, come on! I know the guy. We've done all kinds a' shit together: Hoops, hockey!
JANINE: Oh, and girls can't play sports?!
KEENAN: Oh, -whatever! Christ, Janine! Why the hell would he want to be a That's so hard to imagine?!
JANINE: That's so hard to imagine?!
KEENAN: Uh, -YEAH!
SYDNEY: HEY! LISTEN UP! I know what I'm talking about. You see this?
JANINE: Who's he? An Ex? .Oh, my God.
SYDNEY: Ex me.
KEENAN: You're one too? You're a Z? You're a guy?!
SYDNEY: Was. I made a terrible mistake.
KEENAN: You musta' worked out.
LUKE: What's this all about?
JANINE: It's just a little something we thought you might want.
LUKE: What the hell is this for?
KEENAN: ( elated ) I told her. ( to Janine ) I told ya'. What a stupid ass Keen! Don't! We just want you to know, whatever you decide, it's all right with us.
JANINE: Keen! Don't! We just want you to know, whatever you decide, it's all right with us.
LUKE: Decide?! WHAT?! No, it's not! Get this thing away from me! JUDAS
PRIEST!: Luke HURLS the box out to the curb. Keenan gives him a thumbs up!
KEENAN: Sorry, man. Think she wishes everyone was female.
JANINE: What's that s'posed to mean?
KEENAN: Oh, Christ, Janine! It means he doesn't want to be girl! Like he'd have to think about THAT!
JANINE: There happen to be millions of us out there that like being female!
LUKE: Well, bully for YOU!
JANINE: NO! I want to know! Just exactly what's wrong with being a girl?!
LUKE: Nothin'! It's great! It's fuckin' PHENOMENAL, if you happen to BE one!
JANINE: Maybe we should've had this conversation the other afternoon?!
LUKE: That wasn't my choice!
JANINE: I sure as hell didn't make you do Janine, will you just let me talk to him for a sec'?
KEENAN: Janine, will you just let me talk to him for a sec'?
JANINE: Oh, what?! It's a 'GUY THING?!' Give me a fuckin' break!
KEENAN: Sorry, man. She talked me into it. You know Janine.
LUKE: Keenan GRINS, rides off.
KEENAN: ( calling back ) You should thank me. The one she picked out was PINK!
MICHELLE: Hey. How are you?
LUKE: Hey. How are you?
MICHELLE: I'm okay. You?
LUKE: Okay. You look really nice.
MICHELLE: Thanks. I was hopin' you might I was going to.
LUKE: I was going to.
MICHELLE: There's something I need to talk to you about. -But did I do something No. Nothin' like that. There's just some stuff I've got to sort Like what?
LUKE: No. Nothin' like that. There's just some stuff I've got to sort Like what?
MICHELLE: Like what?
LUKE: Me too. What did you want to talk to me about?
MICHELLE: Nothing really. So, heard you and Max really got into it?
LUKE: Yeah. I kind a' lost it.
MICHELLE: He knows how to push buttons, huh? What exactly did he say that got you so pissed off?
LUKE: I don't know. We'd just finished a game. I was all revved up.
MICHELLE: He's actually a really nice guy.
LUKE: Not sure he's too crazy about me seein' his sister.
MICHELLE: Did he scare you off?
LUKE: No, he doesn't "scare" me. What, his struttin' around, thinkin' he's such a bad ass, with his shirt hangin' open half the time?
MICHELLE: It's just an act. He likes pretending he's Joe Cool. Always says you gotta' just be whatever you want, and fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
LUKE: Well, he's a joke alright.
MICHELLE: Look, I'm not sure this is gonna' work out.
LUKE: I'm sorry, I didn't mean-
MICHELLE: No. I can't do this. I'm not sure you even know who you are. Much less who I am. Have you ever even had a girlfriend?
LUKE: What's that supposed to mean?!
MICHELLE: Well, if you think my brother's such a "joke," how much better could you think of me? We're not that different, you know?
LUKE: You're totally different. He's a guy, for one.
MICHELLE: And he's my best friend. If you don't like him, you can't like me.
MAGAZINE RACK: THE MODELS AND OTHERS on half a dozen covers begin stripping down, moving to other magazines and making out with each other all across the rack.
MICHELLE: "I wanna know how to go To the inside of love. I can't find my way through."
MAX: "Must be a special view, Finding a me with a you, On the inside of love."
SYDNEY: Oh, honey. Come in.
LUKE: You're one too. Why didn't you tell me?
SYDNEY: I didn't want to confuse the issue.
LUKE: So, it's true what you said? You really know. I wouldn't change unless I wanted to?
SYDNEY: Maybe some part of you.
LUKE: What part? How much of me? I mean, for it to work? Half? More than half? What if it was only a tiny bit, -a thought?
SYDNEY: I don't know. But I believe there may be thousands of Z's out there, millions for all we know, go their whole lives without even knowing they are one. Nothing ever happens. You couldn't keep it from I love being with Michelle. How come I can't control it when she's I think whatever part of yourself you deny, just gets bigger and bigger until it takes you over.
LUKE: I love being with Michelle. How come I can't control it when she's I think whatever part of yourself you deny, just gets bigger and bigger until it takes you over.
SYDNEY: I think whatever part of yourself you deny, just gets bigger and bigger until it takes you over.
LUKE: You think I don't really want to be a man.
SYDNEY: I think for some, making it stop is more important than knowing who you are. It was for me.
LUKE: Maybe for me too.
SYDNEY: Right now, you're Morphescent. The key is to have sex with another Z. You become Adulmorphic. Your gender locks. You can't just change anytime you want.
LUKE: Another Z?
SYDNEY: That's why I came all the way out And why you keep tryin' to get me in the sack?
LUKE: And why you keep tryin' to get me in the sack?
SYDNEY: Thought maybe I could save you some distress. But you say you're not attracted to me. For it to work, both of us have to be into it.
LUKE: That won't be a problem.
SYDNEY: Okay then.
LUKE: Not right now? Okay. Tonight.
SYDNEY: Not right now? Okay. Tonight.
LUKE: Remember that Christmas when Keen and me accidentally set the Scofields' house on fire?
MAX: You're about the last person I expected to see.
LUCA: I can show you a few moves if you Yeah? What the hell.
MAX: Yeah? What the hell.
LATER: Luca demonstrates hockey technique, expertly guiding a hockey puck through an obstacle course of broken equipment, timber, and sawdust piles.
LUCA: Not bad.
MAX: You're better than Luke.
LUCA: I taught him everything he knows.
MAX: I thought you left town?
LUCA: Had to come back.
MAX: Where'd you learn to speak Italian?
LUCA: Where'd you learn to speak Italian?
MAX: Just tourist stuff. "I'll have the spaghetti bolognese." "How much for a room?"
LUCA: Have you been?
MAX: Little Italy. In New York. Someday, though. Want to go with
LUCA: Look, this was a mistake.
MAX: Yeah. Of course. I know.
LUCA: Oh, Jesus.
MAX: Are you and he.?
LUCA: It's really none of my business.
MAX: It's really none of my business.
LUCA: No! I'm sorry. I shouldn't've come here.
MAX: Please don't say you're "just visiting." That you "need to leave." I'm the one who needs to
KEENAN: I mean, what the FUCK is goin' on?! You do wanna' be a girl? You're into guys now?
LUKE: No! I don't know exactly. I don't
KEENAN: What about Michelle?
LUKE: I had to be sure. I am now. Come on, it's sort of a Catch-22. I make out with a girl, I start turning into one. You gotta' admit, it's a little weird, isn't Let's get outta' here. You want a ride somewhere? Janine's?
KEENAN: Why don't you go see her? Think you're more her type.
LUKE: "See me around?"
KEENAN: Look, I'm gonna' find my own place, okay? This is gettin' too fuckin' weird for me.
LUKE: I'm goin' to Dr. Catchadourian's tonight. To make this stop.
KEENAN: I don't care. I've had it with all this crap. I mean, you gonna' start hittin' on me next?
LUKE: Yeah, that's right Keenan, you and me: let's do it.
LUKE: I guess I really did need to face it head on in order to see.
SYDNEY: It was courageous.
LUKE: Girls, are just, I don't know. It's a different energy. They're soft and warm, they can make a guy feel complete.
SYDNEY: And multiple o's. Actually, male Z's have multiple o's too. Been so long I nearly forgot.
LUKE: Okay, to be honest, I'm relieved you sorted this out. My conscience would have bothered me for decades if we'd just gone ahead without you being certain.
SYDNEY: Okay, to be honest, I'm relieved you sorted this out. My conscience would have bothered me for decades if we'd just gone ahead without you being certain.
LUKE: To manhood!
SYDNEY: We just do it. And, .it just
SYDNEY: Do you like this dress?
LUKE: Sure. Looks great on you. Man, dresses! Even without everything else, dresses are reason enough right there to stay a guy.
SYDNEY: "Stay a guy?" Let me get this straight. You didn't decide to be a woman?
LUKE: No. Of course not. What?
SYDNEY: Just testing you. Hold on a moment. There's something I
LUKE: What's that for?
SYDNEY: You've never done it with another Z. Trust me, you need to be tied Does it hurt?
LUKE: Does it hurt?
SYDNEY: On the contrary.
OH, MAN!!: SYDNEY ( O.S. )
NOOOOO!!!!: The SOUNDS ESCALATE, growing increasingly more INTENSE,
MALE SYDNEY: ( into phone ) I hear you're the best. Yes, it's an emergency! Please. Or I'll have to cut it myself. ( to Luca ) Now, you look me in the eye, and tell me that wasn't the best sex you ever had.
LATER: Luca lies alone in the room, bound and gagged on the bed.
SIDE WINDOW: The ivy parts and Keenan peers in.
KEENAN: What's goin' on? Where is she?
LUCA: Janine said he's definitely there.
KEENAN: Did she mention me?
LUCA: 'Cause it really is totally cool either way.
KEENAN: 'Cause it really is totally cool either way.
LUCA: I'm SURE.
KEENAN: Okay, I just don't want you to think I'm zerophobic, or somethin'.
MALE SYDNEY: You're on the wrestling team.
JEREMY: Yeah. You catch the meets?
MALE SYDNEY: Just an educated guess. Wanna'
LUCA: Can't this thing go any faster?!
KEENAN: I mean, if I weren't a hundred percent sure which I'm s'posed to be. If you had to say.
LUCA: I mean, if I weren't a hundred percent sure which I'm s'posed to be. If you had to say.
KEENAN: All I know is, every time you look at Michelle, or think about her, you smile. What the hell else do you need to know?
LUCA: It's not right. She deserves to be with a normal guy.
KEENAN: So, you don't get to be with
LUCA: She's not gonna' want some guy who thinks maybe he's supposed to be a girl sometimes.
KEENAN: How do you know? Did you ask?
LUCA: No way I'm gonna' ask her that.
KEENAN: Well, you have to. Where are your nads, man?!
MALE SYDNEY: Come on, let's grab a couple beers.
LUCA: Let's go!
KEENAN: Jeez. She won't even look at me.
MALE SYDNEY: I do love to mess with Texas.
LUCA: MALE SYDNEY
MALE SYDNEY: We better get outta' here.
JEREMY: Keenan?! It's not the way it Oh, Jeremy, I so profoundly don't care if you're queer. Trust me, around here, that's nothin'!
KEENAN: Oh, Jeremy, I so profoundly don't care if you're queer. Trust me, around here, that's nothin'!
LUCA: You son-of-a-bitch! We're doin' it again, right now!
JEREMY: Jeez. She your wife?!
MALE SYDNEY: No! She just said, she wants sex! I can't. I'm sorry.
LUCA: "Sorry?!" Fuck you! FUCK ME!
NOW!: MALE SYDNEY
MALE SYDNEY: It won't work.
LUCA: We're goin' inside right here!
MALE SYDNEY: I'll scream rape.
LUCA: So will I.
MALE SYDNEY: But I'm gay!
LUCA: So what?
MALE SYDNEY: We both need to be into it, or nothing happens.
KEENAN: Such bullshit.
MALE SYDNEY: That's why I became a woman in the first place. I couldn't handle it. Figured if I was female, it was okay to like guys.
KEENAN: She's lyin'.
LUCA: You're tellin' me, 'cause you're straight as a girl and I'm straight as a guy, we can screw and switch, 'cause you're straight as a girl, and I'm gay as a guy, even if we do I'm just screwed.
MALE SYDNEY: 'cause you're straight as a girl, and I'm gay as a guy, even if we do I'm just screwed.
LUCA: I'm just screwed.
KEENAN: Jeez. You need trigonometry to figure this thing out. Maybe you're 'bi.'
MALE SYDNEY: In my world the Kinsey scale's three-dimensional, but trust me, girls do nothing for me. Zilch! You, on the other hand.
LUCA: What am I gonna' do?
KEENAN: What if he's lying? I say, do him again anyway!
LUCA: MALE SYDNEY
MALE SYDNEY: Fine. Waste of time.
LUCA: Oh, man.
KEENAN: Oh, man.
LUCA: It's not what you think.
KEENAN: What does she think?
LUCA: I'm not sure.
MICHELLE: You asshole!
MICHELLE: I don't believe this. You slept with that guy?!
LUCA: It's not what you think.
MICHELLE: Oh, please! What about Max?
LUCA: What about him?
MICHELLE: Don't you care about him at all?!
LUCA: Not like that: I'm straight! I'm attracted to you!
MICHELLE: Oh, who cares, you idiot! And sorry to break it to you, but I'm straight too.
LUCA: No. This'll sound crazy, but I'm not who you think I am-
MICHELLE: Oh, Christ, Luke, -Luca: I know who you are!
LUCA: You know I'm a Zerophiliac?!
MICHELLE: Yes! So you can just go fuck yourself. -Literally!
LUCA: Does Max know who I am?
MICHELLE: What if he does? Do you?
LUCA: He's a guy!
MICHELLE: And you're a girl!
LUCA: I'm not!
MICHELLE: There's no supposed to be anything, you just ARE!
LUCA: Is that what you think?! NO!
MICHELLE: Well, then congratulations! You're a guy, just like every other guy I ever met! I can't believe you slept with him!
LUCA: He was a woman! I was tricked. I didn't know I'd switch.
MICHELLE: You're gonna' tell me he's a Z too?! Both of you?!
LUCA: Well, that's just perfect. What, is there something in the water around here?!
MICHELLE: Well, that's just perfect. What, is there something in the water around here?!
LUCA: She told me it would make it stop. That it would keep me from turning into a girl.
MICHELLE: So what?! Why's that so important to you?! There's no way this was gonna' work.
LUCA: Because I'm a Zerophiliac.
MICHELLE: Because you can't stand being one! Bye, Luca.
LUCA: ( correcting her )
KEENAN: The best part's just lyin' there after. Really close, really far Like goin' to the moon, maybe.
JANINE: Like goin' to the moon, maybe.
KEENAN: Yeah. .They should open a pizza joint up there.
LUCA: What am I gonna' do?
KEENAN: Maybe being a woman'll turn out okay. Like being an elevated member of the male species.
JANINE: Elevated "member?"
KEENAN: I just mean, maybe he'll learn to like it.
JANINE: ( sarcastic, to Keenan ) As hard as that is to conceive!
LUCA: Shut up! Both of you! What, you want a written guarantee? You're so damn lucky! You're into him, he's into you. Super-glue! What the hell else do you need to know?
KEENAN: I think you're the female half of I think you're the macho half of
JANINE: I think you're the macho half of
LUCA: And I don't know what half of who the hell I am.
JANINE: What are you gonna' do?
LUCA: I don't know. I prefer being a guy, but I'm a girl? I'm attracted to Max, but I'm in love with Michelle? It's like I'm s'posed to be both.
POLLY: Girl trouble? Boy trouble?
MAX: What's the point? It never works out. Or they just cheat on you Liverpool was a veritable shagfest when I was your age. A boulevard of broken hearts. But eventually, I found him.
POLLY: Liverpool was a veritable shagfest when I was your age. A boulevard of broken hearts. But eventually, I found him.
MAX: Everything reminded me of him. So, I came here, half way round the world to forget. Then created this place, just like the one where we He can't handle this. Us. He can't handle who he is.
POLLY: Everything reminded me of him. So, I came here, half way round the world to forget. Then created this place, just like the one where we He can't handle this. Us. He can't handle who he is.
MAX: He can't handle this. Us. He can't handle who he is.
POLLY: You being a guy too?
MAX: Or him being a girl.
POLLY: Everyone's terrified. But once you really know someone, and they know you, it makes you whole.
MAX: No one wants to know who I really You're so sure?
POLLY: You're so sure?
MAX: It's impossible. He was the one person I thought could understand. But no, it's impossible.
POLLY: It's worth finding out.
LUCA: I know she doesn't want to talk to me. But do you know where I can find her?
MAX: I know she doesn't want to talk to me. But do you know where I can find her?
LUCA: I know she doesn't want to talk to me. But do you know where I can find her?
MAX: New York. Left two days ago.
LUCA: Oh, man. .You're staying?
MAX: Just 'til Friday.
LUCA: I wanted to apologize to her. Forget it, I don't know,. Obviously, nothing's gonna' ever be with me and her, but I just wish she knew how much I, -and that I wasn't cheating, I was just trying to be a man for her. She'd have a field day with that one, huh?
MAX: If you talk to her, please just tell her, I'm sorry, and I wish her the best,. everything.
LUCA: If you talk to her, please just tell her, I'm sorry, and I wish her the best,. everything.
MAX: Luca 'nods', not fully understanding Max's response.
LUCA: I'm sorry. To you too.
MAX: For what?
LUCA: Mixed signals, I guess.
MAX: Ow! Son-of-a-bitch!
LUCA: You all right?
MAX: Stepped on a nail. Damn it!
LUCA: I wish.
MAX: You definitely had me confused.
LUCA: For whatever it's worth. I think you're a pretty hot guy.
MAX: Thanks. But you're not interested?
LUCA: Truth is, I am. And I guess it sounds crazy, but I couldn't do that to Michelle.
MAX: For whatever it's worth, I think you're pretty hot too.
LUCA: Too bad you're a moron.
MAX: Too bad you're a moron.
LUCA: Excuse me?
MAX: I have incontrovertible proof.
LUKE: Hey you. .Good morning. What's
