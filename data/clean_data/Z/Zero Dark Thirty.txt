DANIEL: I own you, Ammar. You belong to me. Look at me. This is DANIEL STANTON, the CIA's man in Islamabad - a big American, late 30's, with a long, anarchical beard snaking down to his tattooed neck. He looks like a paramilitary hipster, a punk rocker with a Glock.
DANIEL: ( to the guard ) Are we gonna board up these windows or what?
MAYA: I'm fine. She's not.
DANIEL: Just so you know, it's going to take awhile. He has to learn how helpless he is. Let's get a coffee.
MAYA: No, we should go back in. Something about the strange intensity of her expression makes Daniel reconsider and he turns back to the interrogation You know, there's no shame if you wanna watch from the monitor. She shakes her head.
DANIEL: You know, there's no shame if you wanna watch from the monitor. She shakes her head.
MAYA: You're not wearing one. Is he ever getting out?
DANIEL: CUT TO:
DANIEL: Right now, this is about you coming to terms with your situation. It's you and me, bro. I want you to understand that I know you, that I've been studying you for a very long time. I could have had you killed Karachi. But I let you live so you and I could talk.
AMMAR: ( RESISTANT )
DANIEL: Life isn't always fair, my friend. Did you really think that when we got you, I'd be a nice fucking guy?
AMMAR: You're a mid-level guy. You're a garbage man in a corporation. Why should I respect you?
DANIEL: And you're a money man. A paperboy! Daniel paces around Ammar, anger rising.
AMMAR: I told you before, I won't talk to Have it your way.
DANIEL: Have it your way.
AMMAR: ( gasping for breath ) I don't know, you asshole. Maya shakes her head "no."
MAYA: That's not credible.
AMMAR: ( SCREAMING )
DANIEL: You're a terrorist, that's why I'm doing it to you.
AMMAR: Fuck you. Daniel pours water over the towel so it hits Ammar's nose.
DANIEL: I want emails of the rest of the Saudi group. Give me emails of the rest of the Saudi group! Give me one email, and I will stop this! Ammar doesn't speak. He can't.
BRADLEY: How did it go the other night?
DANIEL: It was good. The local cops need tactical help. But he's Tier fucking One, baby. There's your money maker.
BRADLEY: This is the guy that's KSM's nephew? What's his issue?
DANIEL: He's being a dick.
BRADLEY: If he's trying to outsmart you, tell him about your PhD.
DANIEL: I am going to have to turn up the heat. He needs to give us the Saudi group now. They reach the lobby, where they can see Maya sitting in the holding area. They walk towards her as Bradley considers what Daniel is asking for.
BRADLEY: He's gotta have that - given the family ties. Permission granted, Daniel reassures his boss.
DANIEL: Tight with his uncle, prints all over the 9/11 money. Daniel knocks on the glass for Maya to come in.
BRADLEY: And we continue our Christian mission here. Nice to meet you.
MAYA: You too, Sir.
BRADLEY: How was your flight? They walk down the lobby towards the Secure Wing.
MAYA: She's been having a great time ever since she got in, isn't that right?
DANIEL: She's been having a great time ever since she got in, isn't that right?
BRADLEY: How do you like Pakistan so far?
MAYA: It's kinda fucked up.
BRADLEY: You volunteered for this didn't you?
MAYA: Bradley smiles. He knew she didn't volunteer. They reach a secure area and Bradley checks Maya through an electronic door.
BRADLEY: ( TO MAYA )
DANIEL: Don't you think she's a little young for the hard stuff?
BRADLEY: Washington says she's a killer.
DANIEL: The children's crusade.
BRADLEY: They want the next generation on the field. Listen, I have a meeting with ISI in twenty minutes.
DANIEL: They're slow rolling us in Lahore - you might want to bitch about that.
BRADLEY: Did you see the cable from London?
DANIEL: Dude, I've been in a dark room with another man for the last two days.
JACK: Some dude tells the Malaysian station that his nephew works with a guy who knows a guy
JESSICA: Here we go.
JACK: Hold on - He goes to a big feast in Bangkok about a year ago. The guest of honor? Usama bin Laden. Laughter in the room.
JESSICA: Right, but you forgot - you forgot Mullah Omar. J.J. and JEREMY, two case officers, continue the banter:
JEREMY: ( SARCASTICALLY )
JEREMY: That's me, man. No job too small.
JACK: That's why I have a gift for you, my Jack hands Jeremy a piece of paper. Daniel and Maya enter, a little late.
DANIEL: Everyone, this is Maya. Maya, Please don't ask how it's going with Ammar because she's not going to fucking tell you.
JESSICA: Ammar is withholding? Daniel nods.
FILE ): Washington assesses that Abu Faraj is officially our new number three - JESSICA moves to a wall chart of AQ leadership and repositions Abu Faraj's mugshot to number three in the line, two down from Usama bin Laden. Meanwhile, in the background, the riffs continue -
DANIEL: - Best man for it.
JEREMY: Like we're just keeping it from them. Jessica sits back down and gets down to business.
JESSICA: The Jordanians are being really helpful with Ammar's transit papers. Jessica passes Daniel a file.
DANIEL: Any imminent threats in here?
JESSICA: They want the Consulate, the Marriott, it's low security. And they've got Majid Kahn talking about gas stations in the US.
DANIEL: And that's a conversation? Jessica shrugs. At this point, she believes that it is merely a conversation - not a fully realized plot.
JESSICA: Honestly? There are six hundred questions in there. I'd concentrate on Heathrow. The Saudis. Does it matter what Faraj thinks about Heathrow? How much latitude does he get to pick targets?
DANIEL: I think he'll give up the Saudis. But Heathrow is gonna be tough. Anyway. Anything from last night?
DANIEL: And Lahore reporting ISI down there was painfully slow last night. Again. I'm beginning to think it's not I agree, I spoke to the Chief about that. Anything on bin Laden?
JEREMY: And Lahore reporting ISI down there was painfully slow last night. Again. I'm beginning to think it's not I agree, I spoke to the Chief about that. Anything on bin Laden?
DANIEL: I agree, I spoke to the Chief about that. Anything on bin Laden?
JESSICA: ( reading from a cable ) A farmer on the Afghan border near Tora Bora reports: a diamond shaped pattern in the hills, tall male in the center of the diamond, flanked by four guards. It's consistent with UBL's movements.
JEREMY: That's supposed to be his royal guard?
MAYA: That's pre-9/11 behavior. Jessica doesn't appreciate the challenge.
JESSICA: ( CHILLY )
MAYA: We invaded Afghanistan. That's a And so the rivalry begins.
DANIEL: No, don't need him, the diamond sighting is bullshit. See if the Paks will send someone to talk to the farmer. Anything else? We need to be putting runs on the board against Faraj. Speak to the case officers who didn't see fit to make it today. And thank them.
DANIEL: Let's take it easy today, huh? Daniel hands Ammar a bottle of orange juice and a bag of Hungry? The food in here sucks so I got you some of this. Ammar grabs the lunch sack and scarfs down the falafels.
AMMAR: I'm glad you said that. I have an email from you to him. I've had all your coms for years, bro. Who else is in your Saudi group?
DANIEL: I'm glad you said that. I have an email from you to him. I've had all your coms for years, bro. Who else is in your Saudi group?
AMMAR: I just handed out some cash for them. I didn't know who the guys were.
DANIEL: When you lie to me, I hurt you.
AMMAR: I believe you. I do, I believe you. Do you want the water again, or do you want something else?
DANIEL: I believe you. I do, I believe you. Do you want the water again, or do you want something else?
AMMAR: Just give me a name.
DANIEL: Just give me a name.
AMMAR: I DON'T
I DON'T: Daniel jumps up.
DANIEL: You see how this works? You don't mind if my female colleague sees your junk, do you? Daniel pulls down Ammar's pants. Maya flinches at the bare Dude, you shit your pants.
AMMAR: Your friend is an animal. Please, help me. Please. A long beat.
MAYA: You can help yourself by being The door handle turns. It occurs to Maya that perhaps Daniel was testing her resilience, too, as Daniel re-enters with a DOG COLLAR in his hand.
DANIEL: This is a dog collar. Daniel unhooks Ammar, snaps the collar and leash around his neck, as Ammar cries out against the humiliation. Maya flinches. Daniel is relentless:
AMMAR: ( VERY SOFTLY )
DANIEL: Sunday? Sunday where? This Sunday or next Sunday? Ammar mumbles, almost inaudibly.
AMMAR: Is it Sunday or Monday? Ammar doesn't answer. The masked men approach.
DANIEL: Is it Sunday or Monday? Ammar doesn't answer. The masked men approach.
AMMAR: Beat. The masked men open the box.
DANIEL: Ammar, which day?
AMMAR: ( MUMBLING ) AMMAR ( CONT'D ) AMMAR ( CONT'D )
JESSICA: ( TO DANIEL )
DANIEL: Yeah, now.
JESSICA: You warned them - they didn't take you seriously - this is what happens. It's not on you.
DANIEL: Who said that? Zied? Fuck him. This is on me. Ammar is on me!! And it's on her!! ( pointing to Maya ) We can't let this be a win-win for
JESSICA: No, no, no. You had - what - days - brief custody - and an unresponsive ally. The way you do this is you look ahead. London. Heathrow. Mass casualties. That plan is still Ammar doesn't have a clue about what He knows.
MAYA: Ammar doesn't have a clue about what He knows.
JESSICA: He knows.
MAYA: You have to be really careful with people in KSM's circle - they're He's not going to talk about attacks on the homeland. He's going to withhold operational details on the KSM network and probably on bin Laden. ( flipping her argument ) But he's been in complete isolation, he doesn't know we failed. We can tell him anything.

DANIEL: Bluff him?
MAYA: He hasn't slept, Dan. He's clueless.
AMMAR: ( CAREFULLY )
MAYA: After we kept you awake for 96 hours, you gave us names of some of your brothers and saved the lives of a lot of innocent people.
DANIEL: Which is the smart thing to do, you're starting to think for yourself. Ammar is lost. But the food is tempting.
AMMAR: How did you know that?
DANIEL: I told you man, I know you. Alright, you got me - flight manifests. It must've been pretty fucked up for you guys after 9/11. What did you do after the invasion and before you went back to Pesh?
AMMAR: After 9/11 I had to choose: fight, to protect our turf - or run.
DANIEL: ( SYMPATHETIC )
AMMAR: I wanted to kill Americans. We tried to get into Tora Bora but the bombing was too high. We couldn't cross.
MAYA: Sorry, who is the "we" in that Me and some guys who were hanging around at that time.
AMMAR: Me and some guys who were hanging around at that time.
DANIEL: ( CASUALLY )
AMMAR: Hamza Rabia, Khabab al-Masri, and Abu Ahmed. Maya makes notes on her pad.
MAYA: Who's Abu Ahmed? I've heard of the other guys.
AMMAR: He was a computer guy with us at the time. After Tora Bora, I went back to Pesh - as you know - and he went North, I think, to Kunar.
MAYA: What's his family name?
AMMAR: Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti.
MAYA: Abu Ahmed means "father of Ahmed", it's a kunya.
DANIEL: She got you there, dude.
AMMAR: I swear to you both: I don't know his family name. I would have never asked him something like that. It's not how my uncle worked. My uncle told me he worked for bin Laden. I did see him, once, about a year ago, in Karachi. He read us all a letter from the Sheikh.
MAYA: A letter?
DANIEL: What did it say? Daniel offers Ammar a smoke.
AMMAR: It said "Continue the jihad. The work will go on for a hundred years."
SOLDIER INTERROGATOR: You and I are gonna talk about some of the guys in the training camps, The prisoner sits in a chair. He's hooded, but relaxed.
PRISONER: SOLDIER INTERROGATOR
SOLDIER INTERROGATOR: Some of these brothers have done some bad things, and what I want to do is I want to separate them from the people like you.
PRISONER: Definitely, yeah.
SOLDIER INTERROGATOR: There was a guy called Abu Ahmed from Kuwait.
PRISONER: Yes, I remember him. A nice guy.
SOLDIER INTERROGATOR: How close was he? What was his relationship to the leadership?
PRISONER: I don't know.
SOLDIER INTERROGATOR: Did he eat with you guys - did he eat with the good guys - or did he eat with the leadership?
PRISONER: I don't know, sir. I have no idea about things like that.
SOLDIER INTERROGATOR: Yes you do, you don't need an idea
TURKISH INTERROGATOR: When you met with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, was this one of the The Interrogator flashes a picture. The prisoner moans.
PRISONER: CUT TO
CUT TO: INT. RESEARCH ROOM - LATER She fast forwards a video - shot in a Polish facility. The prisoner appears to be cold.
INTERROGATOR: KSM, your boss.
PRISONER: Mukhtar,'potato', you say 'potahto'. I say 'fucking KSM', but yeah, 'Mukhtar.' After Mukhtar was captured, what did Abu Ahmed do?
INTERROGATOR: Mukhtar,'potato', you say 'potahto'. I say 'fucking KSM', but yeah, 'Mukhtar.' After Mukhtar was captured, what did Abu Ahmed do?
PRISONER: Abu Ahmed, I believe he went to work for The Sheikh.
PRISONER: In Karachi, in 2003 or 2004.
INTERROGATOR: He was carrying a letter from bin INT. RESEARCH ROOM - LATER Still going, looking exhausted now, Maya manipulates the controls of yet another video clip with a different INTERROGATOR and PRISONER. We're now in a Moroccan facility. The interrogator shows him a photograph of a bearded man. Henceforth, The Photograph.
INTERROGATOR: Is that him?
PRISONER: ( NODS )
INTERROGATOR: Say again?
PRISONER: Abu Ahmed. Abu Ahmed. Abu Ahmed. Freeze frame.
INTERROGATOR: Abu Ahmed - is he the courier for bin Laden?
PRISONER: Who knows who works directly for bin Laden? Let's say he's part of the Were there other people who carried messages from bin Laden?
INTERROGATOR: Were there other people who carried messages from bin Laden?
PRISONER: How many other people?
INTERROGATOR: How many other people?
PRISONER: ( THINKING )
INTERROGATOR: Let's talk about them The image freezes. Maya stares at the screen.
JESSICA: How's the needle in the haystack?
MAYA: Facilitators come and go, but one thing you can count on in life is that everyone wants money. The rivalry is in full bloom. Sometimes it's friendly. Sometimes it's not so friendly.
JESSICA: Facilitators come and go, but one thing you can count on in life is that everyone wants money. The rivalry is in full bloom. Sometimes it's friendly. Sometimes it's not so friendly.
MAYA: ( SMILING )
JESSICA: ( BIGGER SMILE )
MAYA: Money for walk-ins worked great in the cold war, I'll give you that.
JESSICA: Thank you.
MAYA: Just not sure those tactics are applicable to the Middle East.
HAKIM: ( TRANSLATING )
MAYA: Who did he work for? Hakim translates. Then the prisoner speaks.
HAKIM: ( TRANSLATING )
MAYA: What did he do for Faraj?
HAKIM: ( TRANSLATING )
MAYA: We need to ask him something to see if he's telling the truth. We don't know if he really knew Faraj. Hakim speaks to the prisoner.
HAKIM: He just told me the names of all of Faraj's children. I think he's telling the truth.
MAYA: Twenty detainees recognize that photo of Abu Ahmed. They say he's part of the inner circle of guys who were hanging out in Afghanistan pre-9/11.
BRADLEY: Well, that's good. You still-
MAYA: Yeah, we don't know if Abu is on the outside of the network - part of a series of cutouts and dead drops - or if he has a direct connection to bin Laden. Does bin Laden invite him into the living room and hand him a letter directly? Or is Abu just the last guy in a long line of couriers, so that's why everybody knows him?
BRADLEY: That's not all you don't know. You don't have his true name, and you don't have a clue of where he is.
MAYA: We know that he's important. The fact that everybody's heard of Abu Ahmed but nobody will tell me where he is suggests that.
BRADLEY: Maybe. Detainees could withhold his location for any number of reasons. Perhaps they don't know; perhaps this Abu is just a cover story and he's really a fucking unicorn. The withholding doesn't reveal what you want it to - does it?
MAYA: And if you did find him, you don't know that he'd be with bin Laden.
BRADLEY: And if you did find him, you don't know that he'd be with bin Laden.
DANIEL: We don't know what we don't know.
BRADLEY: ( TO DANIEL )
DANIEL: It's a tautology.
BRADLEY: ( back to Maya ) Listen, not one single detainee has said that he's located with the big guy, just that he delivers messages. Am I wrong?
MAYA: No. It's still good work.
BRADLEY: No. It's still good work.
NIGHT: Joseph Bradley sits at his desk. The weight of the world on his shoulders. On the television in the background, the news report continues, showing disaster footage of PEOPLE bloodied, EXT. BLACK SITE - AFGHANISTAN The war on terror is growing and spreading, like an octopus, throughout the base. We trace the new tentacles of the CIA facility - more hangars, vehicles, PEOPLE moving to and fro.
CIA GUARD: ( re: the monkeys ) You Agency guys are twisted. The detainee is ready. Daniel nods, weary. Then a monkey reaches through the bars and steals the remainder of Daniel's ice cream cone. He looks at the monkey and laughs.
MAYA: I had you picked up instead of killing you because you're not a violent man and you don't deserve to die.
GHUL: Thank you.
MAYA: But you do have deep ties to Al Qaeda that I want to ask you about before you get sent to your next location, which might be Israel. Ghul looks ashen.
GHUL: What do you want to know?
MAYA: I'm going to ask you a series of questions based on your knowledge of Al Qaeda and your position as key financier for the organization.
GHUL: I have dealt with the mukhabarat, I have no wish to be tortured again. Ask me a question, I can answer it.
MAYA: What can you tell me about Atiyah Abd al-Rahman.
GHUL: He works for Zawahiri. He's in charge of military tactics.
MAYA: In what context have you ever heard the name Abu Ahmed?
GHUL: He works for Faraj and bin Laden. He is his most trusted courier. Maya works hard to hide how pleased she is to have this confirmation. She's not entirely successful.
MAYA: What makes you say that?
GHUL: He brought me many messages from the Where did you last see him, and where is he now?
MAYA: Where did you last see him, and where is he now?
GHUL: You will never find him.
MAYA: Why is that?
GHUL: Even I couldn't find him. He always contacted me out of the blue. He is one of the disappeared ones.
PAKISTANI POLICEMAN: ( IN URDU )
DANIEL: What do you like? Bob Marley? Reggae? Egyptian music? Just let me know, if there's music you like, I can make a call.
DANIEL: Can I be honest with you? I'm bad news. I'm not your friend. I'm not gonna help you. I'm gonna break I've done it before. ( Faraj dozes, weak ) Hey, wake up. You haven't eaten in 18 hours, we've got to keep your energy up. You hungry?
BRADLEY: You're in luck, I got you a one-on- one with Faraj.
MAYA: Seriously? Thank you.
BRADLEY: Don't thank me until you hear what I want for it. He drops a folder on her desk.
MAYA: Don't you want to see what's in the You want family ties, financial networks, media sources, disgruntled employees, imminent threats, homeland Thank you.
BRADLEY: Don't you want to see what's in the You want family ties, financial networks, media sources, disgruntled employees, imminent threats, homeland Thank you.
MAYA: You want family ties, financial networks, media sources, disgruntled employees, imminent threats, homeland Thank you.
BRADLEY: ( WALKING AWAY )
MAYA: Foreign cells, health status, trade craft, recruiting tactics anything INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - MORNING Both Maya and Faraj look tired. This has been going on for A lot of brothers told us Abu Ahmed was bin Laden's courier and that he worked very closely with you.
MAYA: A lot of brothers told us Abu Ahmed was bin Laden's courier and that he worked very closely with you.
FARAJ: You're thinking of Abu Khalid.
MAYA: Al Buluchi. My courier for the Okay, so you're telling me that all the other brothers are wrong, and there's some famous Buluchi guy that is working for you and bin Laden that I've never even heard of?
FARAJ: Al Buluchi. My courier for the Okay, so you're telling me that all the other brothers are wrong, and there's some famous Buluchi guy that is working for you and bin Laden that I've never even heard of?
MAYA: Okay, so you're telling me that all the other brothers are wrong, and there's some famous Buluchi guy that is working for you and bin Laden that I've never even heard of?
FARAJ: Why should you have heard of him?
MAYA: What does this Buluchi guy look like?
FARAJ: Tall, long white beard, thin. He uses a cane.
MAYA: Kind of like Gandolf?
FARAJ: When was the last time you saw him?
MAYA: When was the last time you saw him?
FARAJ: A month ago, in Karachi, but I don't know where he is now. Sometimes I wouldn't even see him, he would just tell me where to leave the messages.
MAYA: I don't believe you. The GUARD in the room with them leans forward and SLAPS Faraj across the face. Faraj's expression doesn't change and Maya herself remains flat and steady, unmoved by the violence. She's not quite the same young lady she was a few years ago.
FARAJ: You can't force me to tell you something I don't know.
MAYA: You do realize this is not a normal prison. You determine how you are treated, and your life will be very uncomfortable until you give me information I need. The guard slaps Faraj again. Faraj is impassive.
MAYA: Faraj is completely denying knowing Abu Ahmed, and that's using every measure we have.
DANIEL: He's either going to withhold or die from the pressure you're putting on Do you want to take a run at him?
MAYA: Do you want to take a run at him?
DANIEL: No? Since when?
MAYA: No? Since when?
DANIEL: You know, I've been meaning to tell you: I'm getting outta here.
MAYA: What? You okay?
DANIEL: I'm fine. I've just seen too many guys naked. It's gotta be over a hundred at this point. I need to go do something normal for awhile.
MAYA: Like what?
DANIEL: Go to Washington, do the dance, see how that environment works.
MAYA: I'm not going to find Abu Ahmed from
DANIEL: They killed my monkeys. Something about an escape. Can you fucking believe that?
MAYA: Sorry, Dan.
DANIEL: Look, Maya, you gotta be really careful with detainees now. The politics are changing and you don't want to be the last one holding a dog collar when the oversight committee comes.
MAYA: I know.
DANIEL: And watch your back when you get back to Pakistan. Everyone knows you there now.
POLICEMAN: Where are you going?
MAYA: To the Marriott. I assume you noticed the dip plates.
POLICEMAN: But you have a bag - The policeman motions to a DUFFEL BAG resting on the rear It's a gym bag. Maya does not get out of the car. She stares at him defiantly. He advances forward a bit. She rolls up her window, flicks the door lock, and starts dialing her cell The policeman walks away to rejoin his group. The police confer. The original policeman returns, this time with several other cops. They knock on the glass. Hard. Maya stares straight ahead.

JESSICA: We're socializing. Be social. Maya puts away her blackberry.
MAYA: We're socializing. Be social. Maya puts away her blackberry.
JESSICA: We're socializing. Be social. Maya puts away her blackberry.
MAYA: ( HALFHEARTEDLY )
JESSICA: Look, I know Abu Ahmed is your baby, but it's time to cut the umbilical No, it's not.
MAYA: No, it's not.
JESSICA: So Faraj went south on you - it happens. There are still cells in London and Spain planning the next round of attacks.
MAYA: I can work on it at the same time - plus I think it's a good thing that he lied.
JESSICA: No, not at the expense of protecting the homeland, you can't. Wait a minute, why is it a good thing?
MAYA: You sound just like Bradley. He doesn't believe in my lead either.
JESSICA: Or it's confirmation bias.
MAYA: He's probably stuck in some check- point somewhere.
JESSICA: You two hooked up yet?
MAYA: Hello, I work with him. I'm not that girl, that fucks. It's So? A little foolin' around wouldn't hurt you.
JESSICA: So? A little foolin' around wouldn't hurt you.
JESSICA: The Jords have a mole!
MAYA: Jessica pops a CD into Maya's computer, loads a file that plays the same video clip we have just seen.
JESSICA: He made this video to prove his bona Shut the fuck up! The camera stops on one man, BALAWI.
MAYA: Shut the fuck up! The camera stops on one man, BALAWI.
JESSICA: ( POINTING )
MAYA: This could be it!
JESSICA: This is it.
CONTINUOUS: Bradley has just finished watching the video. Maya and Jessica are in his office waiting for his verdict.
JESSICA: He's right there in the inner circle.
BRADLEY: I don't buy it. Didn't you tell me yourself nobody turns on Al Qaeda?
JESSICA: The Jords worked him for a year. Dinners, money. They've convinced him that it's his patriotic duty to turn on Al Qaeda and get rich doing Yeah, so the Jords say.
BRADLEY: Yeah, so the Jords say.
MAYA: ( TO BRADLEY )
JESSICA: ( CATCHING ON )
MAYA: The key is to meet him so we can figure out for ourselves what he can actually do.
BRADLEY: He really asked for a dialysis machine? You can fill the damn thing with poison.
JESSICA: The meeting with Balawi is off. He can't come here to Islamabad.
MAYA: Can't or won't?
JESSICA: He's not going to travel - security
MAYA: He knows we're white. You'll get kidnapped up there. DAVID, an analyst, adds his two cents to the conversation -
DAVID: We could do it somewhere else - Germany, or the UK? He's got a clean He's not going to travel out of Al Qaeda territory.
JESSICA: He's not going to travel out of Al Qaeda territory.
DAVID: And you're not going to him.
JESSICA: I'm not. Believe me.
DAVID: What about Camp Chapman? Afghanistan. That could be safe territory.
JESSICA: ( INTO PHONE )
JESSICA: Don't be so literal. Everyone likes cake. It's not too late for you to come, you know. It will be fun.
MAYA: I don't want to be a straphangar. It's your show. You were the first to see the potential in this.
MAYA: Cool. Bring me back a bottle.
JESSICA: Not to get technical, but this guy is actually the first big break we've had since 9/11. To big breaks and the little people that make them So far, everything he's said we've cross checked and it's proved legit. and I think the money is persuasive. 25 million dollars?! That buys a new life.
JOHN: Do you think he might be exaggerating his access?
JESSICA: Possibly. But Al Qaeda needs doctors and they are short staffed and that could explain his rise. In six months to a year, if he doesn't fuck up, he could be called in to treat bin Laden. And at that moment, with 25 mil on the table, I think he gives up the Big Man. And if he doesn't, we kill EXT. CAMP CHAPMAN CIA COMPOUND - AFTERNOON The same gathering as the day before, waiting under the merciless sun.
JESSICA: So John? ( John turns to her ) When he arrives, I'll set the tone, and then I'll flip it to you - and you'll talk about asset protection.
JOHN: Roger that.
JESSICA: Then Lauren, I know you want to get some questions in there - but give Balawi time after John speaks. We'll cover the basics and have his birthday cake, then we'll get to the nitty Jessica turns to Zied.
ZIED: I'll introduce you, and you introduce your team. He knows this is a high level meeting.
SECURTY GUARD: Quick question: all is taking place inside our main building?
JESSICA: Right. And Lauren? Washington will want real time updates so please stay on top of that. Be concise. The Director is in the loop. And I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't update the President.
LAUREN: Yeah, I'm on it. They take in the possibilities.
JESSICA: Now, I just need to get Balawi's ass down here.
JESSICA: ( to the Security Gyard ) Why are there gate guards there? We talked about this, no one is supposed to be there when my source arrives. You might have spooked him already!
SECURTY GUARD: Procedures only work if we follow them every time.
JESSICA: This time is different - I'm sorry I can't explain, but it's for a good Look, I'm responsible for everyone's safety, okay? It's not just about I just need them to go away for a minute. You can search him as soon as he gets here. The Security Guard pauses, then into his radio:

CHECKPOINT GUARD: ( OVER RADIO )
SECURTY GUARD: Okay, he's coming. We're gonna search him when he gets here. Everyone prepares. The car gets closer and closer, a driver in front and a passenger in back.
BLACKWATER GUARD: ( to the other guard ) Is he supposed to limp like that?
SECURTY GUARD: Take your hand out of your pocket! Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar
BALAWI: Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar
BLACKWATER GUARD: ( raising his M4 ) Get you hand out of your pocket!
BALAWI: Allahu Akbar. Jessica's smile fades And Balawi detonates a suicide vest hidden under this jacket and the resulting shrapnel storm pulps the crowd, massacring them all -
JEREMY: You okay? No response.
PRISONER: He's dead, in Afghanistan, 2001. I buried him with my own hands.
INTERROGATOR: Maya stares at the screen.
PRISONER: Maya stares at the screen.

GEORGE: I want to make something absolutely If you thought there was some secret cell somewhere working Al Qaeda, I want you to know that you're wrong. This is it. There's no working group coming to the rescue. He stares at his staff.
DEBBIE: Hi. I painstakingly combed through everything in the system and found She hands Maya a file.
MAYA: Doesn't matter, but I wish I had that five years ago. How come I never saw it before?
DEBBIE: Nobody saw it, most likely. There was a lot of white noise after 9/11, countries wanting to help out, we got millions of tips and.
MAYA: ( DISTRACTEDLY )
MAYA: ( OVER SPEAKER )
DANIEL: Fuck. Really?
MAYA: ( OVER SPEAKER )
DANIEL: Ok, but he's dead. So doesn't that make him a little less interesting to you?
DANIEL: Okay, what are you basing this on?
MAYA: We have no intercepts about Abu Ahmed We just have a detainee who buried somebody who looked like Abu Ahmed. But if somebody as important as Abu Ahmed had died, they'd be talking about it online in chat rooms all over the place. Plus, the detainee said that Habeeb died in 2001. We know that Abu Ahmed was alive then, trying to get into Tora Bora with Ammar. That means it's probably one of the other brothers that's dead.
MAYA: Yes, I fucking want it to be true. Maya slams the desk.
MAYA: I am calm.
MAYA: Move heaven and earth and bring me this fucking Sayeed family's phone INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS, COUNTER TERRORISM CENTER DIRECTOR - LANGLEY, VA. - DAY A dark ( window shades down ) executive office, where in the shadows a white American man in a nice suit is kneeling on a prayer rug and saying the Islamic daily prayers. Daniel waits as the man recites the prayers and presses his pale forehead to the carpet. This is WOLF. He is the head of the agency's COUNTER TERRORISM CENTER ( George's boss ).
DANIEL: As-Salamu alaykum.
WOLF: Alaykum salam.
DANIEL: I need a couple hundred thousand. Four max.
WOLF: Where you gonna get that?
DANIEL: From you.
WOLF: You think so?
DANIEL: This could crack open the facilitator Maya's been looking for by giving us a phone number.
TRANSLATING ): Allah rewards those who strive and fight over those that sit behind a WOLF nods. If the blatant attempt to play on his Muslim belief bothers him, he doesn't show it at all.
WOLF: As you know, Abu Ghraib and Gitmo fucked us. The detainee program is now fly paper. We got senators jumping out of our asses, and the Director is very concerned. They will not stop until they have a body. There it is. The quid pro quo. There's a reason he's called The Wolf. Daniel considers all that he'll go through if he volunteers to be the fall guy for the controversial program.
DANIEL: I ran it. I'll defend it.
DANIEL: It's good to be back in Kuwait. It's good to see you again, it's been awhile. The businessman doesn't answer.
KUWAITI BUSINESSMAN: Why should I help you?
DANIEL: Because we're friends.
KUWAITI BUSINESSMAN: You say we are friends. How come you only call me when you need help? But when I need something - you are too busy to pick up the phone. I don't think we are friends.
DANIEL: Fair enough. How about a V10 Lamborghini? How's that for EXT. LAMBORGHINI DEALERSHIP - KUWAIT CITY - NIGHT They wait while a Lamborghini SALESMAN, disheveled, clearly just awakened, unlocks the door of the dealership.
DANIEL: ( to the Kuwaiti
BUSINESSMAN ): The poor fucker had to get out of ( to the Salesman ) As-salamu alaykum. Thanks my friend.
DANIEL: Is this a Balboni? Fuck me. This is nice. What are you thinking?
KUWAITI BUSINESSMAN: I think I'll choose this one. The salesman retreats to a back office.
DANIEL: That's a nice choice, my friend. Daniel gives the Kuwaiti a slip of paper.
KUWAITI MAN: Who is it?
DANIEL: Who do you think? The guy's a terrorist. His mother lives here. I just need her phone number.
KUWAITI MAN: There will be no repercussions in Somebody might die at some point in They shake hands.
DANIEL: Somebody might die at some point in They shake hands.
MAYA: Hey, Jack.
JACK: You're not gonna like this, he's on the phone, but there's no team to deploy right now.
MAYA: She dashes out runs down the hall to an Exit sign - bursts through the door to a staircase -
MAYA: How come you haven't deployed a team to stay in Rawalpindi?
LARRY: For one thing, it's dangerous. For another, the area is too congested for us to be effective without some predictive intelligence.
MAYA: That's why you should forward deploy - so you can shorten your response Still, it wouldn't work.
LARRY: Still, it wouldn't work.
MAYA: The guy never stays on the phone long enough.
LARRY: The guy never stays on the phone long enough.
MAYA: You haven't tried.
LARRY: Look, I don't have the personnel.
MAYA: That's bullshit.
LARRY: As it is, my guys don't get any sleep tracking the threats within Pakistan. Larry pushes past her to leave, and she follows him.
MAYA: Right, I understand. But I don't really care if your guys get sleep or not. Maya looks at Larry's team sleeping on the couch.
LARRY: This guy you're obsessed with, what's his name again?
MAYA: Abu Ahmed al Kuwaiti is the nom de guerre. His true name, we think, is Ibraheem Sayeed. His family lives in Kuwait.
LARRY: Wasn't it, like, eight brothers - and a million cousins - that we know about - anyone could be calling home -
MAYA: I know -
LARRY: - It's not like he's saying, "Hey mom, it's me, the terrorist."
MAYA: Over the course of two months, he's called home from six different pay phones, from two different cities, never using the same phone twice. And when his mother asked him where he was, he lied. He said that he was in a place in the country with bad cell reception implying he was in the Tribals but he was in
LARRY: Maybe he just doesn't like his mom?
MAYA: No. Not okay. Look, Abu Ahmed is too smart to tip his hand by talking about ops on the phone: he works for bin Laden. The guys that talk about ops on the phone don't get that job. Larry looks away.
MAYA: I really need to talk to you about beefing up our surveillance operation on the caller.
BRADLEY: We don't have a surveillance operation on the caller. ( turning to Maya ) Someone just tried to blow up Times Square and you're talking to me about some facilitator who some detainee seven years ago said might have been working with Al Qaeda? Maya is practically shaking with zealous rage at her inability to bend Bradley to her will.
MAYA: He's the key to bin Laden.
BRADLEY: I don't fucking care about bin Laden. I care about the next attack. You're going to start working on American Al Qaeda cells. Protect the homeland.
MAYA: bin Laden is the one who keeps telling them to attack the homeland.
BRADLEY: ( ANGRY )
MAYA: You just want me to nail some low level Mullah-crack-a-dulla so that you can check that box on your resume that says while you were in Pakistan you got a real terrorist. But the truth is you don't understand Pakistan, and you don't know Al Qaeda. Either give me the team I need to follow this lead, or the other thing you're gonna have on your resume is being the first Station Chief to be called before a congressional committee for subverting the efforts to capture or kill bin Laden.
BRADLEY: You're fucking out of your mind.
MAYA: I need four techs in a safe house in Rawalpindi and four techs in a safe house in Peshawar. Either send them out or send me back to DC and explain to the Director why you did it.
JACK: Fuck the mom, we got the man himself. Jack puts a cell phone down on the counter.
PHONE ): - This phone will ring. Did I hook you up? Maya throws her arms around him.
MAYA: I love you!
MAYA: It would be convenient for him to drop tapes off if he's sending either from bin Laden or from an intermediary. When he wants to make a call, he leaves the house, walks a few blocks, then switches on the phone. We need to keep canvassing the neighborhood until we find him.
LARRY: We got a shooter! Larry tries reversing but a compact car wheels in right behind them, and Larry slams on the brakes. The TECH raises an M4.
TECH: We're blocked.
HAKIM: Let me talk to them.
HAKIM: They said white faces don't belong here. If they don't move, shoot A tense beat while the men stare, then finally leave.
COMPUTER TECH: He's east of us. Try the market.
JACK: Lahore street, which is also in Pesh, thirty minutes. Wazir Bag Road, five. Nishterabad, five. Phandu Road, five minutes, the Grand Trunk Road, forty five seconds. There's no pattern. Sometimes he calls every two weeks - sometimes every three - there's no consistency - I can't predict when he's gonna make another call because the guy's erratic.
MAYA: Do you think its intentional?
JACK: It might be. Maybe it just looks erratic to us. I just can't tell.
LATER: Maya and Bradley and several other STAFFERS watch the protest through a window -
MAYA: ISI fucked you. I'm so sorry Joseph. It's the first time she's addressed him by his first name. Startling, to hear kindness in her voice. Joseph turns to reply then thinks better of it and walks INT./ EXT LARRY'S MINIVAN - STREETS OF PESHAWAR - MORNING Larry's minivan chugs through the crowded markets.
TECH: Still on tower three! Five. Signal getting stronger. Ten! Larry continues driving straight down the main road.
LARRY: Heading South. The van passes horse-drawn carts, men on cell phones, fruit stands. The Tech studies his screen.
TECH: He's up at five again. Fifteen. Weaker now, he's shifted. We're back to five. I don't get it.
LARRY: He's driving in circles. Larry now drives very fast back to the main road.
TECH: MAIN ROAD
MAIN ROAD: And now Larry stops in the middle of the market.
LARRY: Let's hope he comes back around. Twenty. Thirty. Forty! Fifty - we're within ten meters of him. Larry scans the street - sees a half dozen guys on cell He's really close.
TECH: Twenty. Thirty. Forty! Fifty - we're within ten meters of him. Larry scans the street - sees a half dozen guys on cell He's really close.
LARRY: Look at the cars. He's in a vehicle. Larry spots something:
TECH: Could be.
LARRY: You got him?
TECH: I got him.
LARRY: I'm breaking off - The grey minivan pulls away.
MAYA: Is this what I think it is?
LARRY: The guy you've been looking for, geo- located on his cell phone in his white car.
MAYA: Thank you!
LARRY: If you're right, the whole world's gonna want in on this, so you gotta stick to your guns now.
ALEXANDER: ( INTO PHONE )
MAYA: I need a picket line along the GT highway and men spaced at intervals along the road and at every exit.
ALEXANDER: Maya, I know -
MAYA: So you agree with me now. This is No, I've just learned from my predecessor that life is better when I don't disagree with you.
ALEXANDER: No, I've just learned from my predecessor that life is better when I don't disagree with you.
GUARD: Good morning.
MAYA: Good morning, Amad. Maya gets in her car. The gate opens. As she starts pulling out onto the street, suddenly a car drives up in front of her and THREE SHOOTERS come out and hammer Maya's Toyota.
CUT TO: INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY STATION CHIEF'S OFFICE - ISLAMABAD - Doesn't matter. You're on a list. Next time there might not be bulletproof glass to save you.
MORNING: Doesn't matter. You're on a list. Next time there might not be bulletproof glass to save you.
ALEXANDER: Doesn't matter. You're on a list. Next time there might not be bulletproof glass to save you.
MAYA: And you, of all people, should know that once you are on their list, you never get off.
ALEXANDER: And you, of all people, should know that once you are on their list, you never get off.
STEVE: Basically we had a guy who rolled with Al Qaeda and did services for them. We lost him for seven years and now we found him again and boy does he have a really nice house. Is that it?
MAYA: Pretty much.
STEVE: Okay, let's go talk to the boss.
STEVE: ( GENTLE )
MAYA: The question isn't are the Paks protecting bin Laden?'
CIA DIRECTOR: Go ahead.
STEVE: If you take a right out of Islamabad and drive about forty-five minutes North, you'll find yourself here in Abbottabad. A middle class community - some ex-military - not particularly interesting to us. Except we did find this compound, which is unique. We got a sixteen foot wall around the entire perimeter, the windows are blacked out. It's a fortress.
CIA DIRECTOR: Can't you put a camera somewhere - in the trees - to get a look into the main house?
GEORGE: It will probably be discovered.
CIA DIRECTOR: We have to get a look into the house. The Director moves to the satellite image.
GEORGE: The PMA - The Pakistan Military Academy. It's their West Point.
CIA DIRECTOR: And how close is that to the house?
GEORGE: About a mile. A WOMAN'S voice from the back of the room.
CIA DIRECTOR: Who are you?
MAYA: I'm the motherfucker that found this place, Sir. The boss studies her for a moment then turns back to the I want to know more about who's inside this house by the end of the week. The brass files out, leaving Steve and Maya.
CIA DIRECTOR: I want to know more about who's inside this house by the end of the week. The brass files out, leaving Steve and Maya.
STEVE: "Motherfucker?" Really?
MAYA: ( through the glass ) Morning, George. In red magic marker, Maya writes the number 21 on the glass. Then circles it. George looks up.
MAYA: ( INTO PHONE )
STEVE: Swing by, I want to show you INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS MAYA'S DESK Maya jumps up from her desk.
STEVE: This is from a few minutes ago. We've got two males, two females, and seven kids. Maya points to one of the shapes in the courtyard.
MAYA: Who's that?
STEVE: I'm saying that's Bushra. The brother's wife.
MAYA: How do you know the gender?
STEVE: ( points on screen, to a thin line ) This is a clothes-line here, for laundry. Men don't mess with the We watch that shape move away from the clothes-line and back to the house.
MAYA: What's that up there? ( pointing to the other
SHAPES ): Those are kids. They're shuffling around, sword-fighting or something with sticks.
STEVE: Those are kids. They're shuffling around, sword-fighting or something with sticks.
MAYA: Your female is moving fast.
STEVE: That's what I wanted to show you. ( to the Imagery
TECHNICIAN ): Can we pause this please?
MAYA: So you found two males, three females?
STEVE: That's correct. Maya suddenly gets it.
MAYA: You're missing a male.
STEVE: Yes we are.

CONTINUOUS: George is on one side of a conference table, on the other side is the DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR, THE SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR, and the
GEORGE: If there are three females, there ought to be three males. Observant Muslim women either live with parents or with their husbands. We think there's a third family living in the SUPERIMPOSE: SITUATION ROOM - THE WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR So this third male that you've identified as possibly being bin Laden, do I just give up all hope of ever seeing a photograph of him?
GEORGE: Hope? Hope is not a targeting layer. You give up your hope right now. We scanned for heat signatures, but we can't validate if it's a man or a woman up there. We found a safe house, but we can't get a vantage point to fire a telescope over the balcony wall.
GEORGE: We talked about burrowing a pin hole camera but there's a high risk of We have explored the possibility of digging tunnels, of sending hot air balloons, of re-routing supply C- 130's to take a peek, but that might be too alerting. We've looked for ways of collecting available DNA from his trash - you know, looking for his toothbrush, but they burn the trash. We started a vaccination program, we sent a doctor to the house, to see if he could pull blood. A lady in a black burkha rushes out and angrily shoos the doctor away.
GEORGE: What was wrong with that? The sample would be too diluted.
GEORGE: They don't make telephone calls from the compound. We pulled the cell tower nearby.
GEORGE: The unidentified third male does not get groceries. He does not leave the compound. He does not present himself for photographs.
DEALER: ( reading from the
BINDER ): A fifteen percent chance that he's a Kuwaiti arms smuggler, a ten percent chance that he's one of the relatives of the brothers.
GEORGE: You know we lost our ability to prove that when we lost the detainee Who the hell am I supposed to ask? Some guy in Gitmo who is all lawyered up? He'll just tell his lawyer to warn bin Laden.
GEORGE: He'd be the first successful drug dealer never to have dealt drugs. He has no internet access to the house. He makes no phone calls either in or out. Who's he selling to, who's he buying from, how's he making his money? And if you're going to say he's retired, I'd say where's his swimming pool, where's the gold cage with the falcons? And why does he send his courier to the two cities in Pakistan we most associate with Al Qaeda, that have nothing particularly to do with heroin The National Security Advisor taps his pencil impatiently.
GEORGE: I have to admit, I just don't get the rhythms of politics.
GEORGE: You know, you're right, I agree with everything you just said. What I meant was, a man in your position, how do you evaluate the risk of not doing something, the risk of potentially letting bin Laden slip through your fingers? George shakes his head with an "aww shucks" kind of shake.
GENERAL: I actually tried to kill this program a couple of times. They've gone through an initial round of testing, and they have excellent radar defeat - we just haven't tested them with people in them yet. The General continues his briefing..
JUSTIN: Excuse me. Can I ask a question? What do we need this for in Libya? Gaddafi's anti-air is virtually non- Maya looks over, not sure what to say.
GEORGE: Gentlemen, can I have your attention? My name is George. I run the Af-Pak division at CTC, and I'm primary on this for the agency. This is a title fifty operation.
MAYA: There are two narratives about the location of Osama bin Laden. This registers on the SEALs.
JUSTIN: Excuse me. You got an intel source on the ground?
MAYA: No? Okay, so how do you know it's bin Laden? We've been on this op before, you know.
JUSTIN: No? Okay, so how do you know it's bin Laden? We've been on this op before, you know.
MAYA: Bin Laden uses a courier to interact with the outside world. By locating the courier, we've located bin Laden.
PATRICK: That's really the intel? That's it?
MAYA: Quite frankly, I didn't even want to use you guys, with your dip and your velcro and all your gear bullshit. I wanted to drop a bomb but people didn't believe in this lead enough to drop a bomb, so they're using you guys as canaries on the theory that if bin Laden isn't there, you can sneak away and no one will be the But bin Laden is there - and you're going to kill him for me.
PATRICK: ( SOFTENING )
GEORGE: They are nervous downtown. I don't think we'll get approval this decision They look up and notice that Maya is standing outside George's office staring at them through the glass. She angrily wipes the number 128 off the window and changes it to 129. Wolf nods.
WOLF: It's her against the world.
GEORGE: Oh yeah.
MAYA: We've spun up the SEALs - we've done everything humanly possible to collect on the compound, and the collection is not going to get any better.
GEORGE: We have to keep working it.
MAYA: You're going to come into work one day, and there's going to be a black moving van and a 'for sale' sign in front of that compound. George drops his tray down.
GEORGE: Maya, you didn't prove it.
CIA DIRECTOR: I'm about to go look the President in the eye and what I'd like to know, no fucking bullshit, is where everyone stands on this thing. Now, very simply. Is he there or is he not fucking there? He looks to the Deputy Director.
DEPUTY DIRECTOR: We all come at this through the filter of our own past experiences. I remember Iraq WMD very clearly, I fronted that and I can tell you the case for that was much stronger than this case.
CIA DIRECTOR: Yes or no.
DEPUTY DIRECTOR: We don't deal in certainty, we deal in probability. I'd say there's a sixty percent probability he's there. The CIA Director points to Wolf.
WOLF: I concur. Sixty percent.
GEORGE: I'm at eighty percent. Their OPSEC is what convinces me.
CIA DIRECTOR: You guys ever agree on anything?
DANIEL: Well, I agree with sixty, we're basing this mostly on detainee reporting and I spent a bunch of time in those rooms - who knows? Maya shoots Daniel a look. What a traitor.
CIA DIRECTOR: This is a cluster-fuck, isn't it?
JEREMY: I'd like to know what Maya thinks.
DEPUTY DIRECTOR: We're all incorporating her assessment into ours. Maya can't take it anymore:
MAYA: One hundred percent, he's there - okay, fine, ninety-five percent because I know certainty freaks you guys out - but it's a hundred!
CIA DIRECTOR: They're all cowed. What do you think of the girl?
JEREMY: I think she's fucking smart. As the door closes.
CIA DIRECTOR: We're all smart, Jeremy.
CIA DIRECTOR: May I join you? She nods, gulps.
CIA?: Twelve years. I was recruited out of high school.
MAYA: Twelve years. I was recruited out of high school.
CIA DIRECTOR: Do you know why we did that?
MAYA: I don't think I can answer that question, sir. I don't think I'm allowed to answer.
CIA DIRECTOR: What else have you done for us besides bin Laden?
MAYA: Nothing. I've done nothing else. He evaluates her. weighing her certainty against his decades of Washington experience.

PATRICK: Her confidence. Maya smiles, laughs.
JUSTIN: Really? Okay. That's the kind of concrete data point I'm looking for. He shakes his head.
GEORGE: Maya, I wanted you to hear it first. You know that thing we talked about? It's going to happen.
MAYA: Tonight. Good luck. She hangs up, turns back to the SEALs, who are still playing horseshoes with the grace of young guys in their prime. Their lives are in her hands.
