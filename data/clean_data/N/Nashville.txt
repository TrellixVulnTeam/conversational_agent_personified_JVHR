WADE: ( to SUELEEN ) You want a ride into town?
SUELEEN: You bet. REESE looks up, checking out SUELEEN, then WADE, then the TRICYCLE MAN, then his breast pocket to see it his wallet and checkbook are still there, then he buries himself in his Got me an audition tonight.
SUELEEN: Got me an audition tonight.
WADE: Well, you just remember, if you can't kick front, kick back, 'cause at least you're kicking. Ten minutes, okay? She nods and talks to the TRICYCLE MAN. REESE keeps sneaking looks at her.
SUELEEN: I've just been waiting for the right spot to sing in. I'm so She laughs and starts to rinse the dishes in the sink.
SUELEEN: I'm good, though. There ain't but one Sueleen Gay I don't mean to be conceited, but really it's true. I've been taking special coaching lessons from Zeke Willard he's just wonderful. Teaches you how to phrase; that's really important. And breathing. Well, you know all about that. Anyway, I wrote this She looks down and then begins to half whisper, sing, and half do all of the gestures for a song she has written as she wipes some glasses. The jukebox continues to play CONNIE WHITE, and every time someone walks by, Sueleen stops. She finally gets through the song and discovers REESE has been watching, too. She looks away from him to the TRICYCLE MAN, who smiles. Be has finished his meal.
SUELEEN: Oh, listen, I really do go on. Here's your check. Sure has been nice talking to you. As she removes her apron, a HAVEN HAMILTON song comes on the jukebox, "Keep on a goin'." The TRICYCLE MAN leaves.
BUD: Sorry. He sees a tape recorder and gets upset. She looks at him.
BUD: He's my father.
OPAL: Haven Hamilton is your father? Can you arrange an interview?
HAVEN: Who the hell is playing piano? Get that hippie out of here. He's got a tin ear. I asked for Pig, dammit. I'm moving on 'cause I gotta get to the airport. When you get my backups straight, then we'll talk about cutting this tune here. He heads for the hallway.
OPAL: Excuse me, sir. I'm here putting together a film. I would like to ask some questions. She has to fumble with the bulky tape machine and transformer.
HAVEN: I'm from BBC television.
OPAL: I'm from BBC television.
HAVEN: Where the hell is that? HAVEN nod a politely and leaves the crowded hallway with BUD and PEARL. He spots LINNEA.
HAVEN: How you doing, Haven?
LINNEA: How you doing, Haven?
HAVEN: oh, fine. Couldn't be better.
TOM: You ladies got room for a spare?
STEW: 14B NEW ANGLE
L.A. JOAN: 'Bye. nice talking to you. GREEN sees his niece and walks over.
GREEN: She turns.
L.A. JOAN: Did you see who that was?
GREEN: Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, He is just wonderful.
L.A. JOAN: He is just wonderful.
GREEN: I'1l get your bag.
GLENN: Am I late?
NORMAN: Late! Oh, Jesus! He runs off.
HAVEN: Delbert, how are you?
REESE: I'm fine. This here is John Triplette. Triplette, like you to meet the Honorary Mayor, Haven Good to meet you. Bud, have them move the horses.
HAVEN: Good to meet you. Bud, have them move the horses.
TRIPLETTE: Where is she?
REESE: Where is she?
HAVEN: Still inside the plane posing for pictures and signing autographs. She's got a new album cut again. She'll be down in a minute. But she'll be late for the Opera if she doesn't hurry. Bud, get the plane on the walkie-talkie. BUD fumbles on his walkie-talkie telephone, but can't seem to get They don't seem to be answering. The ambulance boys are here, though. Barnett always expects them to get there like a shot. That thing only goes a hundred fall bore with the sirens going.
BUD: They don't seem to be answering. The ambulance boys are here, though. Barnett always expects them to get there like a shot. That thing only goes a hundred fall bore with the sirens going.
HAVEN: Thank you, Bud. BUD nods like he has been complimented.
HAVEN: Bud, tell them to move the horses. Promised this strip would be spic and span. He smiles and winks.
REESE: Listen, we'll go get the car and come back. This'l1 be going on for a while.
HAVEN: You bet. She's probably talking to somebody about their sick child. You know how she is. They wave goodbye and head in the direction of the loading zone. Behind them, the horse people disperse and get into their cars and horse trailers, preparing to return to Nashville.
NORMAN: BILL slaps him on the back and engulfs him.
BILL: Hi, Norman. NORMAN looks relieved. BILL and MARY have been arguing.
NORMAN: Sure is nice to see you all again. I never thought I'd see you again after the last time.
BILL: Oh, Norman, you worry too much. MARY takes NORMAN'S hand.
MARY: Norman, how are you? She kisses him and he blushes. BILL and MARY are glad to talk to someone else.
NORMAN: Fine. Just fine. As they walk to the limo, we see a car with loudspeakers on top of it and clearly written door signs that read: "Replacement Party" in red, white and blue. REESE and TILIPLETTE are walking toward it, shaking hands with several people.
NORMAN: Sure have missed you all, though. Oh, where's Tom? Isn't he with you?
BILL: Don't worry about old Tom.
VOICE: Have you thought about your future and what America needs to examine. Behind the Replacement Party car is an airport bus with "Connie White" posters on the side. GLENN is one or the passengers. He cranes his neck to continue watching the runway and BARBARA JEAN.
ATTENDANT: How long was she out?
BARNETT: Not too long. But she keeps passing out. She comes to and looks at them all.
BARBARA JEAN: ( oblivious ) Just give your manna that vitamin E. Makes a world of difference.
HAVEN: Here she is again. She resists the ammonia, looks around and passes out again.
ATTENDANT: Okay, let's get her to the wagon. A stretcher is brought in and she is placed under oxygen. BARNETT climbs into the ambulance with BARBARA JEAN, slamming the door on DELBERT and TRIPLETTE. HAVEN stands there, yelling at people. DELBERT and TRIPLETTE rush back to their car as the ambulance speeds off, siren wailing.
GREEN: Eater's been asking for you. L.A. JOAN is trying to find a station she likes on her transistor Uh huh.
L.A. JOAN: Uh huh.
GREEN: She's been in the hospital two weeks yesterday. L.A. JOAN can't find anything she likes.
L.A. JOAN: You know anything about the stations here?
GREEN: ( hasn't heard ) It's hard to say. Doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. All it was was appendix.
L.A. JOAN: All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A.
GREEN: Did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul. He chuckles at his prepared joke.
L.A. JOAN: Well, I could use one, especially if I'm pregnant.
GREEN: What did you say?
L.A. JOAN: I said, maybe I'll change my name I see. Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
GREEN: I see. Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
L.A. JOAN: But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
GREEN: Maybe you can look after me a That Tom sure is cute.
L.A. JOAN: That Tom sure is cute.
27 AMBULANCE: speeding by each vehicle. BARBARA JEAN and BARNETT are alone.
PEARL: We had these two city boys come in last week. One or them said his Ford truck had cut off his foot. The other one said that wasn't true. Then the first said he looked just like Eddie Black when he said Bud, would you be sure to get the oil changed?
HAVEN: Bud, would you be sure to get the oil changed?
BUD: Ya. where do you want me to take Do you remember Eddie Black? He had those blue eyes.
PEARL: Do you remember Eddie Black? He had those blue eyes.
HAVEN: Where you always take it. There's nothing special about this time.
PEARL: And they started pounding on each other. But the one without the foot was strongest.
HAVEN: Bud, you're going to have to show up at the hospital tar me I gotta get back to that session.
BUD: Okay. Anything you want me to say?
HAVEN: Say I had to get back to the session. ~ God All school did for you, you can put in a thimble.
PEARL: The cops came through and broke it up. I finally just had to call Chet and say, 'Chet, get over here. There are two old bays here breaking up the furniture.'
WADE: Is that what you're going to sing? She laughs.
SUELEEN: No That's exercises. My coach says you have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be stretched. Every time you stretch them, the middle part sets stronger. That's the place where I You think I got any kind of a He breaks into a scale.
WADE: You think I got any kind of a He breaks into a scale.
SUELEEN: You sure do it loud.
WADE: Is that good?
SUELEEN: It's not bad.
WADE: You think I should take lessons?
SUELEEN: If you're serious. Being serious is real important.
WADE: You serious?
SUELEEN: Wade I've been working toward this audition for years.
WADE: Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.
SUELEEN: You think it will?
WADE: Sure thing.
STEW #1: I just knew that was you when you got on.
TOM: You did, huh?
STEW #1: Ya - I even recognized them.
STEW #2: How long have you been together?
TOM: ( laughing ) Too long.
STEW #3: Is your rather really an actor?
TOM: ( laughing ) All his life.
STEW #3: Me, too. They all laugh. STEW #4 has been driving over-cautiously because of the cargo. TOM leans over and kisses her ear.
TOM: Me, too. They all laugh. STEW #4 has been driving over-cautiously because of the cargo. TOM leans over and kisses her ear.
TOM: You having any fun? She shrieks and practically drives off the road. They all laugh.
TOM: That's the most important thing to have fun
STEW #2: How long are you going to be here?
TOM: Long enough to have fun. They laugh.
TRIPLETTE: What do you think of him?
REESE: Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a long time.
TRIPLETTE: You go to school together?
REESE: No, we never did that
TRIPLETTE: We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him?
REESE: We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him?
TRIPLETTE: Well, I really think he's got a You do?
REESE: You do?
TRIPLETTE: Oh yea There has never been a better time for something new.
REESE: He ain't really new.
TRIPLETTE: He is to a lot of people.
REESE: He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.
TRIPLETTE: You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
REESE: Where are you from?
TRIPLETTE: Southern California.
REESE: You always live there?
TRIPLETTE: Spent time in Arizona. Why?
REESE: Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars?
TRIPLETTE: I know a couple.
REESE: No kidding Wait till I tell Linnea. Who?
TRIPLETTE: Ah. Peter Finch.
REESE: Peter Finch he's English.
TRIPLETTE: Peter Finch he's English.
REESE: I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
TRIPLETTE: Ryan O'Neal.
REESE: You really do? ~ God How come you know them?
TRIPLETTE: Oh, you meet them at parties and I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be Well maybe. Let's see what happens here.
REESE: I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be Well maybe. Let's see what happens here.
TRIPLETTE: Well maybe. Let's see what happens here.
REESE: I'll be dammed.
OPAL: Have your children been deaf since Yes yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here.
LINNEA: Yes yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here.

OPAL: ( not getting the answer she wants ) How long have you been with them?
LINNEA: About three years.

OPAL: Do you like him?
LINNEA: He's a member of our congregation.
STAR: You got the money?
ALBUQUERQUE: Right here.
STAR: Well, don't lose it. Last time I gave you twenty-five dollars, you lost it.
ALBUQUERQUE: Well, that just happened that time.
STAR: Well, it better not happen again. ALBUQUERQUE turns and looks out the window. They ride in resentful silence.
STAR: You lost twenty-five dollars once before that, too, near Christmas time I remember that real well now. December 9th, to be exact.
ALBUQUERQUE: You got a real good memory, Star.
STAR: I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were What do you have to buy?
ALBUQUERQUE: ( ignoring him ) What do you have to buy?
STAR: Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.

STAR: Grand Old Opera
ALBUQUERQUE: Grand Old Opera
STAR: I hate that music.
ALBUQUERQUE: I know that, Star.
NORMAN: Oh, my God! BILL climbs out.
BILL: Norman, just sit there and don't He runs toward the truck. At this point, the TRICYCLE MAN appears through all the cars.
ALBUQUERQUE: Hey, mind if I walk with ya? She looks at his violin case.
ALBUQUERQUE: You a musician?
KENNY: Do you have people in Nashville?
ALBUQUERQUE: Do you have people in Nashville?
KENNY: No Just coming to Nashville, that's all.
BARBARA JEAN: I don't care. I pay you people twenty-five bucks an hour and keep you working steady. Now either go on or turn around. But move.
BARNETT: I don't care. I pay you people twenty-five bucks an hour and keep you working steady. Now either go on or turn around. But move.
MARY: Don't worry, Norman. There's no blood. Nobody's hurt. She climbs out of the car and moves to the freeway rail and yells for some workmen below to call the police.
ALBUQUERQUE: Hurt my foot. STAR approaches his truck, sees ALBUQUERQUE is gone and spots
STAR: Have you seen a woman about so She had on high heels?
KENNY: She had on high heels?
STAR: She had on high heels?
KENNY: Need a ride? KENNY nods "yes" and climbs in the pickup.
STAR: Need a ride? KENNY nods "yes" and climbs in the pickup.
DOCTOR: Barbara, I'd like to talk to you and Barnett alone.
BARNETT: Anything you say. He turns to the visitors.
BARNETT: Doctor says you'll have to go on out now There are tones of disappointment, most of them are very involved in their own conversations. TRIPLETTE walks toward the bed, but can't really get close enough. He finally captures BARNETT as the people start to leave.
TRIPLETTE: Excuse me, Barnett, how's she BARNETT turns and studies him for a moment as though he remembers who he is. He doesn't.
TRIPLETTE: I'm sorry. I feel as if I know you. I'm John Triplette. a friend of Del Reese. I was at the airport. I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm a great fan of hers. If there's anything you need, just give me a call. I'm at the Sheraton South.
BARNETT: She's going to rest now.
TRIPLETTE: Okay, I just wanted to see if I could help out at all. The crowd is almost out of the room now. We see GLENN there as he steps into the hallway.
BARNETT: I appreciate your concern, but she has to rest, so you can go on home.
TRIPLETTE: Oh, sure. He stands there too long.
BARNETT: What do you really want?
TRIPLETTE: Not a thing, Barnett, really. I need a little information. But, ah, it can wait.
BARNETT: You bet.
TRIPLETTE: Okay. Thanks. BARNETT says "you bet" again and closes the door after TRIPLETTE. BARNETT returns to the bed with BARBARA JEAN and the DOCTOR.
DOCTOR: Well, it's exhaustion, pure and simple, and you're going to have to take a rest or you're going to be in big trouble.
BARNETT: She has to be at the opera tomorrow night and then she can go home.
DOCTOR: She's not going anywhere, Barnett. This is precisely what I'm talking about. She is collapsing. She cannot go on without a rest or she will have to stop altogether for a long time.
BARBARA JEAN: Well, I have to go: It's too late to be replaced, and, besides, I just can't do that. Those people get disappointed. They've come in from all over, you know, and this Miss Foxy who's been writing to me for years is going to be there from You cannot leave this bed until I say so. The two of you have to understand that. Barnett, you've got to stop this dovetailing and give her some rest. You don't need to make that much more money.
DOCTOR: You cannot leave this bed until I say so. The two of you have to understand that. Barnett, you've got to stop this dovetailing and give her some rest. You don't need to make that much more money.
BARNETT: It's not the money. The friends and neighbors love her and they want to see her. We got a debt to the Well, they are not going to see her tomorrow night, and I suggest you get on the phone and make the necessary arrangements.
DOCTOR: Well, they are not going to see her tomorrow night, and I suggest you get on the phone and make the necessary arrangements.
TOM: We just got a gold record.
OPAL: Do they have a show to give it to No Hell, some secretary in New York just hands it to you. Only this one kept dropping it out of the Did it break?
TOM: No Hell, some secretary in New York just hands it to you. Only this one kept dropping it out of the Did it break?
OPAL: Did it break?
TOM: Dent it a little. Boy just she couldn1t even find it. She had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks old.
OPAL: How long have you been together?
TOM: Probably a little too long.
OPAL: Do you study at all?
TOM: Depends on what I'm studying. STAR is down at the end, drinking alone and looking for ALBUQUERQUE. The phone rings and the MANAGER answers it.
MANAGER: When do you need her?
DELBERT: Monday night.
MANAGER: You want her to sing, too? Sueleen has finished her song and eavesdrops blatantly.
SUELEEN: I can do benefits
MANAGER: ( into phone ) How much?
DELBERT: Twenty dollars for her and ten for The MANAGER keeps looking at SUELEEN
MANAGZR: Well, do you want a blonde?
DELBERT: How does she look?

DELBERT: Okay, I'll get you your money. Both hang up the telephones.
MANAGER: I can only give you fifty a week here and ten bucks for the benefit.
SUELEEN: Money's no object. She kisses his cheek. He hates it. He writes on a piece of You go here Monday night and be there at eight sharp and look flashy you know what I mean? She nods "yes" and takes the paper.
MANAGER: You go here Monday night and be there at eight sharp and look flashy you know what I mean? She nods "yes" and takes the paper.

SUELEEN: Don't you worry about Sueleen Gay. She isn't convincing.
MANAGER: That's for sure. At the airport - that's where it was. At the airport, there in one of those gift shops. Anyway, you better take a Thanks. You are just a wonderful 53 ANOTHER ANGLE ALBUQUERQUE enters. STAR sees her and chases her outside.
SUELEEN: Thanks. You are just a wonderful 53 ANOTHER ANGLE ALBUQUERQUE enters. STAR sees her and chases her outside.

TOM: Yes. Who's this?
LINNEA: Yes. Who's this?
TOM: I'm here.
LINNEA: Who is this?
TOM: Tom. You remember?
LINNEA: ( concealing her laughter ) I'm not sure. Where?
TOM: Remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?
LINNEA: Well, I met you that afternoon in the control room and we.
TOM: Well, I met you that afternoon in the control room and we.
LINNEA: Oh, Tom, of course. What are you doing in Nashville?
T0M: Cutting a record.
TOM: I'd really like to see you.
LINNEA: Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you.
TOM: ( laughs ) That's not quite what I had in She tries not to hear what he's saying.
LINNEA: Well.How have you been?
TOM: Well, they removed my heart last week, but I'm doing fine except my nose fell off. Looks a little She laughs.
TOM: Look, I find you attractive and I want to see you, so I'll call you when I get to my place. He hangs up the phone. LINNEA looks at the dinner table and DELBERT and the kids.
WADE: Hey, what are you doing? ALBUQUERQUE pretends she's fixing her purse.
ALBUQUERQUE: Just fixing this strap here
WADE: I know what you're doing. I've done it too long not to know. But if you're going to hunt down food, get enough so you won't have to do it again right away. Peanut butter's good. Man can last a long time on peanut butter. ALBURQUERQUE can't find any, so she grabs whatever she can that will fit into her purse.
WADE: ( quite drunk and yelling ) Tommy Brown, you are the whitest nigger I have ever seen. TOMMY turns in his chair and looks at WADE. BARNETT leans into
BARNETT: Let's go
TOMMY: I don't think Norman's done yet.
BARNETT: We've heard enough. Come on.
WADE: Hell, you're whiter than that old boy up there. TOMMY and BARNETT leave.
WADE: Where the hell are you going, Oreo The Bluegrass players pick up the tempo by playing music. KENNY tries to calm WADE down, but WADE belts him. NORMAN sings the National Anthem. PEARL gets mad and tosses WADE out the back door. ALBUQUERQUE goes after WADE to soothe him. BILL, MARY and NORMAN leave together out the front. ALBUQUERQUE watches from the 61 EXT. NASHVILLE LOUNGE - NIGHT MARY mothers NORMAN. BILL, MARY and NORMAN enter the limo, leaving KENNY behind. STAR drives up. He recognizes KENNY from the freeway
STAR: Hey, there - You seen my Winifred?
KENNY: You got a place to stay?
STAR: You got a place to stay?
KENNY: No. Probably stay at a motel You in music?
STAR: ( looking at violin case ) You in music?

TRIPLETTE: I'm John Triplette. Excuse me. I got all caught up in looking at you. You'll be fine.
SUELEEN: Oh, why thank you.
TRIPLETTE: May I see your costume? She removes her coat and exposes a costume that looks like a picture of a frosty glass or gin and tonic on a hot day. TIRIPLETTE stares blatantly and REESE can hardly keep his hands off her. SUELEEN starts into her routine as a matter of You like it? Listen, where is the pianist? I need to go over this with him. She hands over a stack of music.
SUELEEN: You like it? Listen, where is the pianist? I need to go over this with him. She hands over a stack of music.
SUELEEN: You all didn't say what you wanted to hear. TRIPLETTE smiles.
SUELEEN: Someday I'm gonna be a star like Barbara Jean. TRIPLETTE puts his arm around her and walks off.
TRIPLETTE: Sueleen, you're prettier and probably sing better. Besides, she is unusually sick. And tonight you have the opportunity to work in front of some grateful gentlemen. They continue to walk past the many places.
TRIPLETTE: Have you ever done this before? She shakes her head, "no" quite caught up in air.
TRIPLETTE: Well, it's not too hard. You'll sing whatever it is you want to sing. They'll applaud like crazy 'cause I can tell them that you're really something and then the piano and drum will give you a little fanfare and you can sing and take off your clothes or not sing. It really doesn't make much difference, really. But since you've never done this before, singing might help. They are near three enormous beef legs waiting to go into the Now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. The more you take off, you see, more money we can raise.
TRIPLETTE: Now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. The more you take off, you see, more money we can raise.
SUELEEN: ( like a robot ) I see.
TRIPLETTE: I know that you are an artist and I am sure you are very religious. She nods "yes."
TRIPLETTE: Well, this is for people who have a kind of religious belief in the way they live.
SUELEEN: Don't you think they'd just love another song instead?
TRIPLETTE: Now, Sueleen, you know that's not what we talked about right here in this very room. It's too late. The ANNOUNCER speaks.
ANNOUNCER: We're ready to striiippppp. for cash, gentlemen. The time has come to dig deep. Our little Sueleen in going to dig deep for you. There are a few chortles. Suddenly she freezes. TRIPLETTE holds her and kisses her hair. Page missing
REESE: Here we are, Sueleen. She looks out the window and nods. He gets out and opens the door as LADY PEARL walks past them on her way to the lounge. STAR drives up behind REESE'S double-parked ear and has to move around it. SUELEEN starts for her room, but REESE follows very close. Finally, he turns her around.
REESE: Sueleen. Sueleen Gay. His look says what he wants. She is terrified.
SUELEEN: Oh, no. She starts to walk quickly, but he grabs her arm.
REESE: Wait a minute! I want to look at you. C'mon.
SUELEEN: Oh, please, Oh, God. He pushes her against one or the storefronts.
REESE: C'mon! I Just wanna look. He squeezes her arm and she screams.
REESE: Good. I wanna look really good. You know what I mean? Do you? Huh? She is about to pass out from terror, when all or a sudden he eases of.
REESE: He releases SUELEEN, turns and runs up the street. She slides down and hugs herself. The TRICYCLE MAN doesn't move.
SUELEEN: It'll be okay. It'll be okay. I know it'll be fine. After a while, she pulls herself up and starts up the stairs to her room. The TRICYCLE MAN watches until she is gone, then walks across the street.

WADE: You know who that is?
LINNEA: I see.
WADE: I see.

TOM: I'd like to sing a new song for you. I threw away a good one I wrote yesterday. maybe it was the day before anyway.. Let's go here, 'I'm Easy.'
WADE: Love, that's a word that's been overused. I'll say I sure like you. LINNEA is wiping her eyes with a hanky. A large group of people starts out the door, among them TOM and L.A. JOAN. TOM steers himself and JOAN to LINNEA'S table. BILL and MARY catch him there. All the while he is talking to them, he writes a note and places it in LINNEA'S lap. OPAL walks past TOM. They look at each other.
BILL: Listen, we're suppose to sing on TV day after tomorrow. At the park.
TOM: Yes. Percy Warner Park'.

BILL: What crook?
WADE: I'm a Roman Catholic. You're Baptist, I bet. Catholic means universal, everything, know what I She nods again. She can't make out the writing with out her glasses and she doesn't want to put them now.
WADE: I'm a scholar of the Bible as well and we're all going to answer to God. Have you read the book of She nods 'yes.'
WADE: You ever read the 'Apocalypse She is too curious. She takes out her glasses and looks through them lorgnette style as WADE continues to talk.
TOM: I'm not coming anywhere near that place. He's a rotten guy.
MARY: That's not true.
TOM: He's a politician.
BILL: He saw us at Tammany Hall.
TOM: The Hell he did. Look, I'll see you in the morning.

WADE: ( to self ) I'm a hundred years old and when I'm two hundred, I'll die.
BARNETT: Well, for heaven's sake. You're just about everywhere, aren't you?
THIPLETTE: I came out to see how you all were doing.
BARNETT: I think I should tell you I know why you're here. The answer is no . we don't get involved in Well, that's not entirely true, Barnett. At least not according to Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
TRIPLETTE: ( laughs good- naturedly ) Well, that's not entirely true, Barnett. At least not according to Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
BARNETT: Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
TRIPLETTE: I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
BARNETT: He knows better.
TRIPLETTE: Well, it's probably because it would help him.
BARNETT: How is that?
TRIPLETTE: Everybody likes to be as good as their word.
BARNETT: Whose word?
TRIPLETTE: His Word.
BARNETT: His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?
TRIPLETTE: That's pretty close. He's going to be on the bill. Why not put Barbara Jean on with him? TRIPLETTE'S last sentence is caught in silence as BARBARA JEAN has stopped singing in the middle of a phrase.
BARBARA JEAN: She faints. There in a moment of confusion, then GLENN is on the stage protectively as the musicians clear the people out
BARNETT: Get her feet up. He pulls himself on the stage. She is coming to and sees GLENN'S face looking at her and rubbing her hands.
BARNETT: Okay, honey. He carries her to the bus. TRIPLETTE is forced to watch from a 182 INT. BUS - DAY BARBARA JEAN has come to and she and BARNETT are alone in the back of the bus. He studies her carefully for a minute and then decides she'll be all right.
BARBARA JEAN: Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry.
BARNETT: Honey, it's okay. How do you feel All those people. She fights back the tears.
BARBARA JEAN: All those people. She fights back the tears.
BARNETT: Don't worry, I'll take care or it
BARBARA JEAN: You're so good. He blows her a kiss and steps from the bus.
BARNETT: She's fine now, folks. Just too soon after the hospital, I guess. She won't be able to continue and she's in the bus crying her eyes out, because she doesn't want to disappoint the people who love her the most. There is a group groan. BARNETT looks for some under-standing but there is none. There are several catcalls and GLENN, who in near BARNETT, becomes so enraged, he tries to find the caller. There is almost a fight, but TRIPLETTE intervenes. He glances to
TRIPLETTE: Come on, come on. You don't want to waste your energy on that fool.
GLENN: She's frail. You never saw anybody so frail. I've seen her breathe hard just standing still, dammit. You're selfish. Worst selfish I've ever heard. What if she died? Would you like that? You'd probably say she faked it so they could make money. Well, you're just dumb.
TRIPLETTE: We could invite them to the park.
BARNETT: They can come to the concert in the I said 'no!' BARNETT studies the angry crowd then TRIPLETTE, who is holding back GLENN against them. The crowd is even more angry
TRIPLETTE: They can come to the concert in the I said 'no!' BARNETT studies the angry crowd then TRIPLETTE, who is holding back GLENN against them. The crowd is even more angry
BARNETT: I said 'no!' BARNETT studies the angry crowd then TRIPLETTE, who is holding back GLENN against them. The crowd is even more angry
BARNETT: ( to crowd ) We're very Sorry. Please. If you'll listen. ( he makes the decision ) You can see her tomorrow at Percy Warner Park. GLENN has disengaged from TRIPLETTE'S hold and pushed his way to the back.
BARNETT: Triplette, I want to talk to you. Moves closer.
BARNETT: I got trapped and you know it, so let's have some rules.
TRIPLETTE: Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.
BARNETT: No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?
TRIPLETTE: Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
BARNETT: Your job, huh. He removes a pen and paper and writes down the following as he She will not appear on the stage or support that Walker guy and you can't have any of his signs up while she sings. She'll be on first and out of the park before he shows up. There will be no pictures, no questions, no answers or tying her name up with his now or in the future to come. Any money she makes will go to the President of the United States. He calls over his secretary and makes TRIPLETTE sign the statement. Then the secretary signs.

BARNETT: We'll see you tomorrow. I'll send her three songs over this afternoon. She'll be done about ten minutes after she starts and Walker better not show up till she's through. Now, get out of here. TRIPLETTE extends his hand expecting friendship. BARRETT ignores it. As TRIPLETTE leaves, a MAN who has been after BARNETT'S attention steps up. BARNETT turns to his secretary.
MAN: ( sharply ) Well, Barnett, I have this terrific song I've been working on. It would be a natural for Barbara Jean. Like you to take a look at it. BARNETT looks at him suspiciously.
BARNETT: ( sharply ) Well, Barnett, I have this terrific song I've been working on. It would be a natural for Barbara Jean. Like you to take a look at it. BARNETT looks at him suspiciously.
MAN: Well, Barnett, I have this terrific song I've been working on. It would be a natural for Barbara Jean. Like you to take a look at it. BARNETT looks at him suspiciously.
BARNETT: I'm very busy right now.
MAN: It'll just take a minute. Here, I'll even hold it for you. BABNETT sighs and skims over the paper. Song stealing is the same as horse stealing to BARNETT. He becomes enraged.
BARNETT: I don't know where you got this, but something tells me you stole it and I hate thieves. The MAN takes the paper back and tries to walk away from him BARNETT yells after him.
BARNETT: Aren't you an engineer.? I know you Don't you work at one of those cut a record places.? Twenty-five bucks a shot, isn't it? Usually their last twenty-five. The MAN backs up and BARNETT follows him. They have entered the crowd. The MAB starts to run. BARNETT runs after him. When the MAN gets into the car. BARNETT picks up a rock, throws it and hits the windshield with it. The car MISFIRES but finally starts.. As the MAN drives off, BARNETT stands watching until he's out of sight.
MC: Thank you, Mr. Berguan. And now we bring you, 'Albuquerque.'
ALBUQUERQUE: Hello, everybody. My name is There are-a few nasty remarks.
ALBUQUERQUE: I'm going to sing a wonderful tune. She starts to sing, "You're an Old Smoothie," and as she does the stock cars leave the pit and drive to the entrance of the track. ALEBUQUERQUE, disturbed at first, sings louder. The cars are waiting for the talent show to set off the track.
MC: We'd 1ike~to announce the winner of tonight's contest. Albuquerque, How about some applause for a darling little lady
ALBUQUERQUE: Oh, I'm not through.
MC: That's all, folks. The stands are calling to have her take it all off and her fellow contestants are furious. RAVEN, BUD and PEARL are there and they discuss her act.
MC: Here is the twenty dollars first prize money and a seat in the grandstands and now let's turn the show over to Al Allen in the race He shuts oft the mike.
AL: Congratulations to Albuquerque and welcome, everyone, to the Memorial Race for Billy Apple, who died a week ago in a wreck at this very track, and we want you to know his last words were, 'Are the other fellows all right?' A wave of applause and we SEE the talent show make its way across the rack. The platform is already torn down and the MC is helping ALBUQUERQUE dress. As she passes the drivers, they cheer and she blows them a kiss and loses her first garment as she does. More cheers.
AL: Want you all to save a dime every day and next Saturday we'll take up a collection and give it all to Billy Apple's wife. Share. Their four kids will sure miss their daddy. Want to announce Bob Trilltree is out of the hospital now. Hope you'll be back with us soon. All right, would you stand, please? The people stand to a scratchy record of the National Anthem. A '74 Pontiac circles the track with a man holding a medium-sized American flag which flaps as the convertible drive.. At the end of the song the Pontiac drives off the track.
AL: This is for Billy Apple. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, let's pick ourselves a winner.
STAR: Hi! Star.
ALBUQUERQUE: Hi! Star.
STAR: Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.
ALBUQUERQUE: I won first prize.

TOM: You're really terrific, you know what I mean LINNEA rolls over and faces him.
LINNEA: I have to go.
TOM: I have to go. He sighs.
LINNEA: I have to go. He sighs.
TOM: I know. She makes a more to leave.

LINNEA: I can't.
TOM: Car pool? She laughs and eases out of the bed.
TOM: When did you think it would happen?

TOM: Terrific! Who was that black guy? A friend of yours?
LINNEA: That's unkind.
TOM: Come on, you ever been attracted to a black guy? She looks at him close, then goes into the bathroom and shuts the 193 INT. MOTEL BATHROOM - AFTERNOON We HEAR TOM making a phone call. LINNEA grabs a towel and wraps it around her head and throws back the shower curtain, only to find a huge black cockroach in the tub. TOM laughs as she shuts the curtain in horror, then she proceeds to take a sponge bath. She leaves the bathroom quickly.
TOM: ( into phone ) Just a minute. He steps to LINNEA and puts his arms around her.
TOM: I'll talk to you tomorrow.
LINNEA: That's what you said before.
TOM: I know. Goodbye. He kisses her and walks back to the bed. As she gets to the door, she is hit with something, It is her slip.
TOM: Maybe you better keep that. He smiles and she walks out the door.
GREEN: Sure. you're a fine boy, Ken, you really are.
KENNY: Okay. you get to sleep. I'll see you in the morning. Good night.
GREEN: Good night, KENNY turns out the light and calls the dog. GREEN settles into his pillow.

GLENN: TRIPLETTE hands her the note as BARRETT angrily steps up. Someone calls "places."
TRIPLETTE: TRIPLETTE hands her the note as BARRETT angrily steps up. Someone calls "places."
BARNETT: They screwed up. You go on after the choir. TOMMY BROWN joins LINNEA and the choir on stage. We SEE TOM wandering and avoiding BILL, but catching MARY'S eye. OPAL is near as is LA JOAN. BARBARA JEAN reads GLENN'S note: "If I die tomorrow, I lived today."
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Barbara The audience is swept away.
BARBARA JEAN: I want to thank you for all your good wishes. You are so important to Barnett and me. Now I want to sing a special song for all our soldier boys. The orchestra starts. She calls for HAVEN to come out. The applause swells and, they start a song together.
HAVEN: Barnett! My God, Barnett I'm TRIPLETTE runs up the stairs and the choir continues. BARNETT yells for them to stop. He and BARNETT are over BARRARA JEAN, while guards and BUD attend to HAVEN.
TRIPLETTE: She's. oh, my God. there's blood here. Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know what to say.
BARNETT: Have your friend Triplette take you to the hospital. A man walks up from the limo. It is WALKER. TRIPLETTE is near.
WALKER: What'd she do, faint again? I'm getting tired of waiting in the TRIPLETTE turns and belts him.
