TINA: Just a dream, Ma. Damn dream, is all.
TINA'S MOTHER: Some dream, judging from that.
TINA'S MOTHER: Hold your horses. You gotta cut your nails or stop that kind of dreaming, Tina. One or the other. Oh, shit.
TINA: ( low ) Oh, shit.
BURN ON: 5. THE FIRST DAY 5.
ROPE JUMPERS: Seven eight, gonna stay up late! Nine ten never sleep again! That's what it reminded me of that old jump rope song. Worst nightmare I ever had. You wouldn't believe it.
TINA: ( referring to kids' song ) That's what it reminded me of that old jump rope song. ( shudders ) Worst nightmare I ever had. You wouldn't believe it.
NANCY: Matter of fact I had a bad dream last night myself.
ROD: ( to Tina ) Had a hardon this morning when I woke up, Tina. Had your name written all over it.
TINA: There's four letters in my name, Rod. How could there be room on your joint for four letters?
ROD: Hey, up yours with a twirling lawn
TINA: Rod says the sweetest things.
NANCY: He's nuts about you.
TINA: Yeah, nuts. Anyway, I'm too tired to worry about the creep. Couldn't get back to sleep at all. So what you dream?
NANCY: Forget it, the point is, body has nightmares once in a while. No biggy.
GLEN: Next time you have one, just tell yourself that's just all it is, right while you're having it, y'know? That's the trick. Once you do that, you wake right up. At least it works for me. Hey! You have a nightmare too?
TINA: Hey! You have a nightmare too?
TINA: I can't believe his mother let him come over here.
NANCY: Right. Well, she didn't, exactly.
GLEN: ( to TINA ) See, I got this cousin who lives near the airport, that it's okay for me to stay with, right? So I found this sound effects tape at Licorice Pizza, and.
NANCY: Worked like a charm.
GLEN: TINA shoves another cassette in, and MICHAEL JACKSON'S 'THRILLER' blasts from the STEREO. The kids relax, the CAMERA GLIDES PAST
NANCY: Nice to have a fire.
TINA: Really. Turn 'er up a little.
NANCY: Maybe we should call Rod, have him come over too. He might get jealous.
TINA: Rod and I are done. He's too much of a maniac.
GLEN: He should join the Marines, they could make something out of him. Like a hand grenade.
NANCY: See? You've forgotten the bad dream. Didn't I tell you?
TINA: All day long I been seeing that guy's weird face, and hearing those fingernails.
NANCY: ( blinks, laughing ) That's amazing, you saying that. It made me remember the dream I had last night.
TINA: What you dream?
NANCY: I dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater; I dream in color, y'know; he walked into the room I was in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and just stared at me. Sort of .obscenely. Then he walked out through the wall on the other side. Like he'd just come to check me out. So what about the fingernails?
TINA: ( quietly ) So what about the fingernails?
NANCY: He scraped his fingernails along things actually, they were more like fingerknives or something, like he'd made them himself? Anyway, they made this horrible nose
TINA: Nancy. You dreamed about the same creep I did, Nancy.
GLEN: That's impossible.
TINA: There's somebody out there, isn't there.
GLEN: There's somebody out there, isn't there.
TINA: There's somebody out there, isn't there.
NANCY: I didn't hear anything.
GLEN: I'm gonna punch out your ugly lights, whoever you are.
GLEN: It's just a stupid cat.
NANCY: Then bring us back its tail and whiskers. Anyway, I don't have a cat.
TINA: Anyway, I don't have a cat.
GLEN: Kitty-kitty? Chow chow chow?
ROD: And it's number thirty-six, Rod Lane, bringing Lantz down just three yards from the goal with a brilliant tackle! And the fans go wild!
TINA: What the hell you doing here?
ROD: Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
TINA: Of course. What's that?
ROD: Intense, huh? So what's happening, an orgy or Maybe a funeral, you dickhead.
GLEN: Maybe a funeral, you dickhead.
NANCY: Just a sleep-over date, Rod. Just Tina and me. Glen was just
ROD: You see his face? Your ma ain't home, is she? Me and Tina got stuff to discuss.
NANCY: But ROD's already got himself and TINA halfway through the living room, heading into the darker part of the house.
ROD: We got her mother's bed. You two got the rest.
NANCY: We should get her out of here.
TINA: Hey you guys're hanging around Don't leave me alone with this lunatic Pleeeeze, NANCY!
GLEN: So we'll guard her together. Through the night. In each others' arms like we always said.
NANCY: Glen. Not now. I mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves.
GLEN: ( frustrated ) Why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway?
NANCY: Because he was scary, that's Who was scary?
GLEN: Who was scary?
NANCY: Don't you think it's weird, her and me dreaming about the same You didn't have a bad dream last night, did you?
GLEN: Me? I don't dream.
GLEN: Morality sucks.
TINA: I knew there was sometihng about you I liked.
ROD: You feel better now, right?
TINA: Jungle man fix Jane.
ROD: No more fights?
TINA: No more fights.
ROD: ( sleepily ) Good. No more nightmares for either of us then.
TINA: ( beat ) When did you have a nightmare?
ROD: ( under the blankets ) Guys can have nightmares too, y'know. You ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something.
TINA: ( sleepily ) Where'd you get this snotty old
TINA: SNORES FROM ROD. TINA sits up. PAST HER TO THE WINDOW. The WIND MOVES AGAIN; the trees brush the window with their shadows. Then another pebble. RAP! TINA slips to the window.
TINA: ( low ) Who the fuck you think you are, whoever you are?
TINA: ( listening ) Somebody there?
VOICE: ( garbled )
TINA: Who the hell
TINA: Oh, shit, please God.
KILLER: ( softly, approaching ) This is God.
TINA: Nancy! Open the door Nancy!
MAN: She's still awake. Nancy can't hear you.
ROD: Suddenly TINA eyes turned inward to her tormentor give an awful jolt her arms and legs are spraddled as if by overwhelming force and pinned to the bed. Next instant, her nightgown flies apart and four long gashes chase across her torso. From no visible instruments! A huge irrigation of blood floods the bed. Terrified, ROD dives for the light but at the same moment something invisible grabs TINA, wielding her body in the air and bringing it around in a swift blow that knocks ROD crashing into the light smashing it to bits. 31. CLOSER ON HIM as he struggles around. In the blue FLASHES OF 31. ELECTRICITY ROD sees TINA sliding up the bedroom wall in a dark smear, dragged feet first! ANGLE ON ROD paralized by terror! ANGLE ON TINA'S DYING EYES moving with her up the wall and bumping around the corner onto the ceiling. She's just looking at who's dragging her, eyes glazing. REVERSE IN HER POV to the shadowy, horrendously ugly MAN, dragging her with fierce glee across the ceiling, literally swabbing the ceiling with her bloody body. SEEN in FORCED PERSPECTIVE, the SHOT carries her across a great distance without seeming to get anywhere as if the ceiling is an endless ANGLE DOWN ON ROD on his hands and knees the lamp next to him blurting blue SPARKS and STROBING the nightmare room. ROD'S screaming up at TINA'S invisible tormentor.
ROD: What the hell's going ON here!
ROD: REVERSE IN HIS POV as the body falls like a sack of rocks onto the devastated bed, in SLOW MOTION, striking with a huge splash of blood. A sick, awful GIGGLE floats around the room, then ECHOES off into infinity. ROD staggers up, staring around as if hoping to see this phantom.
ROD: for that!
GLEN: What the hell's going on!?
NANCY: Oh jeez Glen! Rod's gone ape!
BAM!: Things fall into sudden, awful silence on the other side. GLEN's voice cracks with fear.
GLEN: ( silence ) Rod, you better not hurt Tina.
GLEN: You okay?
NANCY: Yeah. Something slippering all over here.
GLEN: Oh, shit.
OFFICE. ): Lieutenant Thompson. Sorry to wake you, but
PARKER: Lieutenant Thompson. Sorry to wake you, but
LT THOMPSON: I'd've canned your ass if you hadn't. What you got?
PARKER: Her name was Tina Gray. It was her home. Father abandoned ten years ago, mother's in Vegas with a boyfriend. We're trying to reach her now.
LT THOMPSON: What's the Coroner got to say?
PARKER: Something like a razor was the weapon, but nothing found on the scene.
SERGEANT GARCIA: ( wary ) Leautenant. You know who
LT THOMPSON: Where is she?
SERGEANT GARCIA: I put her in your office.
PARKER: Looks like her boyfriend did it. Rod Lane. Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope
LT THOMPSON: Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
PARKER: She lived there.
LT THOMPSON: 38. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM. NIGHT. 38.
MARGE: Hello to you, too, Donald.
LT THOMPSON: THOMPSON glances at PARKER and the other UNIFORMED COPS who are in the room. As a man they head for the door. There's no question who the boss is here. THOMPSON turns to NANCY. She fumbles a smile.
NANCY: Okay. Hi, dad.
LT THOMPSON: I don't want to get into this now, god knows you need time. But I'd sure would like to know what the hell you were doing shacked up with three other kids in the middle of the night especially a delinquent lunatic like Lane.
NANCY: Rod's not a lunatic.
LT THOMPSON: You got a sane explanation for what he did?
MARGE: Apparantly he was crazy jealous. Nancy said they'd had a fight, Rod and Tina.
NANCY: ( quietly ) It wasn't that serious.
MARGE: NANCY sits bolt upright in her chair, her eyes flashing.
NANCY: She was my best friend! Don't you dare say I don't take her death seriously! I just meant their fights weren't that serious.
LT THOMPSON: She had a nightmare about somebody trying to kill her, last night. That's why we were there; she was afraid to sleep alone.
NANCY: She had a nightmare about somebody trying to kill her, last night. That's why we were there; she was afraid to sleep alone.
MARGE: She's been through enough for one night. You have her statement.
LT THOMPSON: ( to MARGE ) I suggest you keep a little better track on her she's still a kid,
MARGE: You think I knew there were boys there!? You try raising a teenager alone.
LT THOMPSON: ( low to PARKER ) See they get home okay.
BURN ON: THE SECOND DAY
MARGE: ( kind ) Where you think you're going?
NANCY: I could hear you tossing and turning all night, kiddo. You've no business going to school.
MARGE: I could hear you tossing and turning all night, kiddo. You've no business going to school.
NANCY: I gotta go to school, Mom. Please. Otherwise I'll just sit up there and go crazy or something.
MARGE: I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know? Right home after. Right home after. See you.
NANCY: I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know? Right home after. Right home after. See you.
MARGE: Right home after. Right home after. See you.
ROD: I'm not gonna hurt you.
ROD: Your old man thinks I did it, don't he?
NANCY: He doesn't know you. Couldn't you change?
ROD: The cops were all over my house. They'll kill me for sure.
NANCY: Nobody's gonna kill you.
ROD: I never touched her.
NANCY: You were screaming like crazy.
ROD: Someone else was there.
NANCY: The door was locked from your
ROD: Don't look at me like I'm some kind of fucking fruitcake or something, I'm warning you.
LT THOMPSON: Now just step away from her, son. Like your ass depended on it. I'm warning you.
NANCY: THOMPSON jerks his gun into the air, furious.
THOMPSON: Jesus are you crazy!?
NANCY: You used me, daddy!
LT THOMPSON: ( exasperated ) What the hell you doing going to school today, anyway your mother told me you didn't even sleep last night!
LT THOMPSON: Nancy! Hey!
TEACHER: According to Shakespeare, there was something operating in Nature, perhaps inside human nature itself, that was rotten a canker, as he put it.
SURFER: ( reading aloud ) Uh, In the most high and palmy state of Rome.
ENGLISH TEACHER: Can it.
SURFER: O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
NANCY: NANCY starts running for it. 51. ANGLE AT THE CORNER as NANCY races blindly around the turn and 51. smashes straight into a BODY lunging at her from the opposite direction! Both go down. 52. ANGLE AT THE FLOOR. A dazed freshman HALLGUARD cranks herself up 52. on one elbow. She wears a plastic plaque on her red and yellow sweater that reads 'Hall Guard'. Her nose is bleeding from the NANCY leaps up
HALLGUARD: Y-you're not supposed to run. W-where's your pass you got a
NANCY: Screw your stupid pass!
HALLGUARD: Hey, no running in the halls!
NANCY: No answer. NANCY starts down the stairs.
NANCY: Gonna get you.
MAN: Gonna get you.
TEACHER: Okay Okay, Thompson! Every- thing's all right now Nancy!.
TEACHER: I'll call your mother.
NANCY: No! No, really, I'm fine. I'll go straight home. I'm okay.
TEACHER: You'll need a hall pass!
TINA: Couldn't get back to sleep at all. What you dream?
NANCY: My dad here?
SERGEANT GARCIA: LT THOMPSON emerges from another room, uneasy to see NANCY.
LT THOMPSON: Decide to take a day off after Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
NANCY: Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
LT THOMPSON: Only family allowed, Nancy. You know the drill.
NANCY: Just want to talk to him a second.
LT THOMPSON: He's dangerous.
NANCY: You don't know he did it.
LT THOMPSON: No, I know, thanks to your own testimony, that he was locked in a room with a girl who went in alive and came out in a rubber bag. I just want to talk to him. Please, Dad.
NANCY: I just want to talk to him. Please, Dad.
LT THOMPSON: Make it fast.
NANCY: ( low ) And then what happened?
ROD: I told you. It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her.
NANCY: How could somebody get under the covers with you guys without you knowing it?
ROD: How the fuck do I know? I don't expect you to believe What he look like? You get a look at him?
NANCY: What he look like? You get a look at him?
ROD: Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
NANCY: Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
ROD: Because somebody cut her. While I watched.
NANCY: Somebody cut her while you watched and you don't know what he looked You couldn't You could just see the cuts happening, all at once.
ROD: You couldn't You could just see the cuts happening, all at once.
NANCY: What you mean 'all at once'?
ROD: ( low ) I mean, it was as if there were four razors cutting her at the same time. But invisible razors. She just. opened up.
NANCY: He stops, and his fist is dripping blood as he says in a small, sad voice.
ROD: I probably could've saved her if I'd moved sooner. But I thought it was just another nightmare, like the one I had the night before. There. was this guy who had knives for fingers.
NANCY: FADE TO BLACK
MARGE: Nancy, don't fall asleep in I won't.
MARGE: Get into bed.
NANCY: I will.
NANCY: MARGE ( OS ) ( through the door )
NANCY: Mother, for petesakes.
NANCY: ( low ) Warm milk. Gross.
MARGE: Nancy! NANCY!
NANCY: REVERSE ON THE DOOR as MARGE, using the old hangar through the doorhandle truck, makes it into the room. She rushes across to the tub. NANCY is staggering up in the bathwater, again with solid porcelain beneath her feet.
MARGE: I told you! Hundreds of people a year drown like that!
MARGE: You okay?
NANCY: ( not believing it for To bed with you, c'mon.
MARGE: ( not believing it for To bed with you, c'mon.
MARGE: No television, forget the homework, no phone calls.
NANCY: No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
MARGE: And no school tomorrow, either. you take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change.
NANCY: Yes, Mother. G'night.
MARGE: Take this, it'll help you sleep.
NANCY: NANCY pops it in her mouth and swallows obediently. MARGE leans to her with a kiss.
MARGE: Sleep tight, don't let the bedbugs bite.
GLEN: Sorry! Saw your light on. Thought I'd see how you were.
NANCY: Sometimes I wish you didn't live right across the street.
GLEN: Shut up and let me in. You ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet?
NANCY: If you don't mind.
GLEN: So. I heard you freaked out in English class today.
NANCY: Guess I did.
GLEN: Haven't slept, have you?
NANCY: Not really.
GLEN: You look dead and rained on, if you want the ugly truth. And what you do to your arm?
NANCY: Burned myself in Englsh class.
NANCY: M'god, I look twenty years old. You have any weird dreams last Slept like a rock.
GLEN: Slept like a rock.
NANCY: ( pleased ) Well at least I have an objective wall to bounce this off. ( off ) You believe it's possible to dream about what's going to happen?
GLEN: You believe in the Boogey Man?
NANCY: You believe in the Boogey Man?
GLEN: One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. he's a fruitcake and you know it.
NANCY: You believe in anything?
GLEN: I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And I'm not too sure about you lately.
NANCY: Listen, I got a crazy favor to ask.
GLEN: It's nothing too hard or anything. I'm just going to. LOOK for someone, and. I want you to be sort of a .guard.
NANCY: It's nothing too hard or anything. I'm just going to. LOOK for someone, and. I want you to be sort of a .guard.
NANCY: Okay, okay. I think.
GLEN: Okay, okay. I think.
NANCY: You won't screw up, right? I mean, a whole lot might depend on it.
GLEN: Okay, I won't screw up.
NANCY: Shhh. Now listen, here's what we're gonna do.
NANCY: ( stage whisper ) You still there? Yeah. So?
GLEN: Yeah. So?
NANCY: Just checking keep out of
NANCY: On your toes, right?
NANCY: She turns back to the cell in desperation.
NANCY: I swear.
NANCY: Glen, where are you! Wake up! I'm here. Glen! Glen!!!
NANCY: Glen! Glen!!!
NANCY: But her voice is garbled as if she's under water, and there's no answer. The only clue to Glen being there at all is his distant SNORING. Innocent. Persistent. Deep. NANCY stops, breath in shreds, face smeared with dirt and tears. Something is clawing the window in the dark of the kitchen. NANCY looks and catches the MAN prying at the glass with his big knife-fingers, the sharp blades SIZZLING against the edges of the glass as they crack it away from the frame. NANCY runs upstairs in blind panic.
NANCY: Glen, you bastard.
GLEN: What I do?
NANCY: ( low ) I asked you to do just one thing. Just stay awake and watch me Just wake me if it looked like I was having a bad dream. ( eyes wild ) But you. You shit what do you do you fall asleep!
GLEN: Oh, shit.
NANCY: Yes, mother?
MARGE: ( beat ) You okay?
NANCY: ( weakly ) Yeah. Just had a little dream. I'm falling right back to sleep.
MARGE: ( beat ) Okay. You need anything, just call.
NANCY: MARGE closes the door. NANCY immediately sits up and looks at the window. A single bone-white feather floats down in the moonlight. Then it's sucked outside and is gone.
GLEN: You mind telling me what's going on?
NANCY: Garcia, I want to see Rod Lane again.
SGT GARCIA: I thought when I took the night shift I'd have peace and quiet for a change.
NANCY: It's urgent, we've gotta see Rod.
SGT GARCIA: It's three in the morning. Your mother know you're out this Of course look, at least go back and look at him. Just see if he's okay.
NANCY: ( faking it ) Of course look, at least go back and look at him. Just see if he's okay.
GLEN: ( faking it ) We have reason to think there might be something weird going Oh, no argument on that.
NANCY: Dad what you doing here?
LT THOMPSON: It so happens I work here, and there's an unsolved murder. I don't like unsolved murders, especially ones my daughter's mixed up in what are you doing here at this hour? You're supposed to be getting some Listen, sir, this is serious. Nancy had a nightmare about Rod being in danger, or something, and so she thinks.
GLEN: Listen, sir, this is serious. Nancy had a nightmare about Rod being in danger, or something, and so she thinks.
NANCY: I just want to see if he's okay!
SGT GARCIA: Take my word for it, Nancy. The guy's sleeping like a baby. He's not going anywhere.
NANCY: This isn't your average nightmare, Daddy damn it!
LT THOMPSON: it. You've already rubbed my nose in sex, drugs and violence don't start throwing in insanity!
NANCY: Just go back and check
LT THOMPSON: Okay, Garcia. What the hell.
SGT GARCIA: ( feeling in his pockets ) Now where'd I put the key.
NANCY: But it's too late; NANCY sinks back in horror as her father and GARCIA rush into the cell.
LT THOMPSON: Gimme a hand, dammit!
SGT GARCIA: Goddamn loco kid he didn't have t'do that Madre dios!
LT THOMPSON: How'd you know he was gonna do
MINISTER: Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. May God be with this young man's
NANCY: ( quietly ) Amen to that much.
LT THOMPSON: How's Nancy doing?
MARGE: I don't think she's slept since Tina died. She's always been a delicate She's tougher than you think. Any idea how she knew Rod was gonna kill himself?
LT THOMPSON: She's tougher than you think. Any idea how she knew Rod was gonna kill himself?
MARGE: No. All I know is, this reminds me too much of ten years ago. Yeah. Well. Let's not start digging up bodies just because we're in a cemetery.
LT THOMPSON: Yeah. Well. Let's not start digging up bodies just because we're in a cemetery.
MARGE: ( very gently ) Time to go home, baby.
NANCY: The killer's still loose, you know.
LT THOMPSON: You saying somebody else killed Tina? Who?
NANCY: I don't know who he is. But he's burned, he wears a weird hat, a red and yellow sweater, real dirty, and he uses some sort of knifes he's got made into a sort of. glove. Like giant finger-
LT THOMPSON: ( low, even, to MARGE ) I think you should keep Nancy at home a few days. 'Til she's really over the shock.
MARGE: I got something better. I'm gonna get you help, baby. So no one will threaten you any more.
NANCY: But I just don't feel. to sleep yet. Please, do I have to?
DR KING: Don't worry, you're not gonna change into Bride of Frankenstein or anything.
MARGE: No, nothing.
NANCY: He means, did you ever drop me on my head. Nightmares are expected after psychological trauma. Don't worry, they go away.
DR KING: Nightmares are expected after psychological trauma. Don't worry, they go away.
MARGE: I sure as hell hope so.
NANCY: I don't see why you couldn't just give me a pill to keep me from dreaming.
DR KING: If you don't dream, you go. All set?
NANCY: They're just simple tests, Nan. We'll both be right Look, I know it's been fright- ening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But. it's okay. Okay?
MARGE: They're just simple tests, Nan. We'll both be right Look, I know it's been fright- ening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But. it's okay. Okay?
DR KING: Look, I know it's been fright- ening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But. it's okay. Okay?
MARGE: Please, Nancy. Trust us.
NANCY: It's not you I don't trust. Okay. Let's do it.
DR KING: How long's this been going on?
MARGE: Since the murder. She was fine before that.
DR KING: Not to worry. No signs of path- ology in Nancy's EEG or pulse rate. I'd guess what we've got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell.
MARGE: It's just made her think. her dreams are real.
DR KING: Ever hear the old Buddhist tale about the King who dreamed he was a beggar who dreamed he was a king?
MARGE: ( immensely relieved ) Thank God.
DISSOLVE TO: 111. A MONTAGE OF SHOTS, of the EKG GRAPH, its inky needles calming, 111. 112. CLOSE ON NANCY on TV MONITOR, asleep like the child she is. 112.
MARGE: What the hell are dreams, anyway?
DR KING: Mysteries. Incredible body hookus pokus. Truth is we still don't know what they are or where they come from. As for nightmares. Did you know that in the last three years twenty Philipino refugees in California died in the middle of nightmares? Not from heart attacks, either. They just died.
MARGE: What happened? That needle sank like a rock.
DR KING: ( quietly ) She's entering deep sleep now. Heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed. All normal. She could dream at any time now. ( beat ) Right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet. Waiting to see what shows up.
DR KING: Okay, she's started to dream.
MARGE: How can you tell?
DR KING: R.E.M.'s. Rapid eye movements. The eyes follow the dream their movement picks up on this Beta Waves are slowing, too. She's dreaming, all right. A good one, too.
MARGE: What the hell's this? She awake or asleep?
DR KING: Can't be. It never gets this high.
MARGE: NANCY!!! IT'S MOM NANCY!!!!
DR KING: Now, this is just going to let you relax and sleep, Nan
NANCY: No. That's enough sleep.
DR KING: Okay, kid. Okay. Fair enough.
MARGE: Oh my god, oh my god.
DR KING: ( to the NURSE ) Get the kit! You believe this?
NANCY: You believe this?
MARGE: ( deathly pale ) Where the hell did you get that?
NANCY: I grabbed it off his head.
BURN ON: THE SIXTH DAY
MARGE: She said she snatched it off his head in a dream. No, I'm not crazy, I've got the damn thing in my hand! I know we did, we all. Gotta go.
NANCY: Go even crazier?
MARGE: I don't think you're going crazy and stop drinking that damn coffee!
NANCY: Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
MARGE: I threw that filthy thing away I don't know what you're trying to prove with it, but
NANCY: What I learned at the dream clinic, that's what I'm trying to prove. Rod didn't kill Tina, and he didn't hang himself. It's this guy he's after us in our dreams.
MARGE: But that's just
NANCY: ( horrified ) Put that damned thing down!
MARGE: ( horrified ) Put that damned thing down!
NANCY: His name is even in it written right in here Fred Krueger Fred Krueger! You know who that is, Mamma? You better tell me, cause now he's after me!
MARGE: Nancy, trust your mother for once you'll feel better as soon as you sleep!
NANCY: You call this feeling better? Or should I grab a bottle and veg out with you avoid everything happening to me by just getting good and loaded
MARGE: ( losing it ) Fred Krueger can't be after you, Nancy he's dead!
NANCY: this time, and you've been acting like he was someone I made up!
MARGE: You're sick, Nancy. Imagining things. You need to sleep, it's as simple as that.
NANCY: Screw sleep!
NANCY: On the door SLAM, we

GLEN: They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
NANCY: Instead of screaming and getting nuts, you say, okay, I'm gonna make up my mind that I fall into a magic world where I can get something special, like a poem or song. They get all their art literature from dreams. Just wake up and write it down. Dreamskills.
GLEN: Instead of screaming and getting nuts, you say, okay, I'm gonna make up my mind that I fall into a magic world where I can get something special, like a poem or song. They get all their art literature from dreams. Just wake up and write it down. Dreamskills.
NANCY: And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what?
GLEN: They turn their back on it. Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
NANCY: What happens if they don't do I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
GLEN: ( shrugs ) I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
NANCY: She leans over the railing, poking her face back into her book. GLEN tips its cover and reads its title. OUR ZOOM IS STILL MOVING CLOSER, a MEDIUM CLOSE UP NOW.
GLEN: 'Booby Traps and Improvised Anti-personel Devices'!
NANCY: I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Well what you reading it for? I'm into survival. She's starting to scare the living shit out of me.
GLEN: ( shocked ) Well what you reading it for? I'm into survival. She's starting to scare the living shit out of me.
NANCY: I'm into survival. She's starting to scare the living shit out of me.
GLEN: She's starting to scare the living shit out of me.
FOREMAN: And the other.
MARGE: Where's your mask and gun?
FOREMAN: Don't bust my chops, lady. If the city found out I put 'em in without inside releases I'd loose my license.
NANCY: Oh gross.
NANCY: Oh, Mom.
MARGE: She rocks the bottle in her arms.
NANCY: What's with the bars?
MARGE: NANCY sits on the bed, a surprising compassion entering her
NANCY: Mom, I want to know what you know about Fred Krueger.
MARGE: Dead and gone.
NANCY: I want to know how, where if you don't tell me, I'm going to call daddy. Your father the cop. That's a good one. Forget Fred Krueger. You don't want to know, believe me.
NANCY: dead and gone he's after me and if I sleep he'll get me! I've got to know! All right.
MARGE: All right.
MARGE: You want to know who Fred Krueger was? He was a filthy child killer who got at least twenty kids, kids from our area, kids we all knew. It drove us all crazy when we didn't know who was doing it but it was even worse when they caught him.
NANCY: So he's alive?
MARGE: He wouldn've stopped. The bastard would've got more kids first chance he got they found nearly ten bodies in his boiler room as it was. But the law couldn't touch him.
NANCY: ( hushed ) What did you do, mother?
MARGE: Bunch of us parents tracked him down after they let him go. Found him in an old boiler room, just like before. Saw him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweater he always wore, drunk an' asleep with his weird knives by his side.
NANCY: ( dreading it ) Go on.
MARGE: We poured gasoline all around the place, left a trail out the door, locked the door, then.
WHOOSH!!!: Her arms shoot up and her eyes go wide with the light of that fire. There's awe in her voice. Then she drops her arms.
NANCY: Who was there? Were Tina's parents there? Were Rod's?
MARGE: Sure, and Glen's. All of us. But that's in the past now, baby. Really. It's over. We even took his knives.
NANCY: All these years you've kept those things buried down here? In our own house?
GLEN: NANCY ( telephone )
GLEN: Oh. Hi, how y'doing?
GLEN: I heard your ma went ape at the security store today. You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something. How long's it been since you slept?
NANCY: Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to. Listen, I. I know who he is.
GLEN: The killer.
NANCY: The killer.
GLEN: You do?
NANCY: Yeah, and if he gets me, I'm pretty sure you're next.
GLEN: Me!? Why would anyone want to kill me?!
NANCY: Don't ask just give me some help nailing this guy when I bring him out.
GLEN: Bring him out of what?
NANCY: My dream.
GLEN: How you plan to do that?
NANCY: Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.
GLEN: ( switching back to a more Wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream!
NANCY: If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.
GLEN: I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway.
NANCY: Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
GLEN: ( simplicity itself ) You heard me. I grab him in the dream you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?
NANCY: ( simplicity itself ) You heard me. I grab him in the dream you see me struggling so you wake me up. We both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. Clever, huh?
GLEN: You crazy? Hit him with what?
NANCY: You're a jock. You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile.
GLEN: ( weakly ) Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep. Midnight.
NANCY: Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep. Midnight.
GLEN: Holy shit! Midnight. Baseball bats and boogemen. Unfucking
LT THOMPSON: Can't sleep, thought I'd come break up the poker game.
SERGEANT GARCIA: If it was any more quiet we could hear owls farting.
LT THOMPSON: Is quiet, isn't it?
SERGEANT GARCIA: ( too casually ) How's your girl?
LT THOMPSON: She's sensible. She'll sleep sooner or later.
MR LANTZ: You'd think they'd have thing 'bout the Lane kid hanging Maybe we're all making more out of it than we should.
MRS LANTZ: Maybe we're all making more out of it than we should.
MRS LANTZ: Glen? you all right?
GLEN: He refocuses his eyes, takes off his earphones.
MRS LANTZ: How can you listen to Carson and a record at the same time?
GLEN: Wasn't listening to the tube, just watching. Miss Nude America's supposed to be on Well how you gonna hear what she says?
MRS LANTZ: Well how you gonna hear what she says?
GLEN: Who cares what she says?
MRS LANTZ: You should get to sleep soon, Glen. It's almost midnight. Goodness knows we've all had enough of a time the last few I will, Mom.in a while. You guys turning in?
GLEN: I will, Mom.in a while. You guys turning in?
MRS LANTZ: Pretty soon.
MARGE: We'll go away, take a vacation. Get your hair colored nice, the way it was. No one will ever This whole room smells of coffee,
NANCY: She scrunches into her pillow. MARGE smiles haggardly and shuts off the light, taking the coffee pot with her as she leaves.
MRS LANTZ: Shouldn't stare.
MR LANTZ: Know what I think? I think that kid's some kinda lunatic. Shouldn't say such a thing about the poor child. If you mean the bars, Marge's just being cautious, her being alone and Nancy acting so nervous lately.
MRS LANTZ: Shouldn't say such a thing about the poor child. If you mean the bars, Marge's just being cautious, her being alone and Nancy acting so nervous lately.
NANCY: ( very quiet, very intense ) Hang on GLEN.
GLEN: Well, I'm not gonna risk sneaking out until she does.
MR LANTZ: Who at this hour?
MRS LANTZ: ( listens, frowns Oh. Hold on. ( covers the mouthpiece ) It's her. She wants to talk to
MR LANTZ: ( whispering ) About what?
MRS LANTZ: ( into phone ) What's this about, Nancy?
MR LANTZ: Glen's asleep. Talk to him Just got to be firm with kids, is all.
NANCY: She goes and sits on the bed, propping her chin on her fists. 161. Yawns. The TELEPHONE RINGS. 161. NANCY snatches it up.
NANCY: TIGHT ON HER, ZOOMING EVEN CLOSER ON HER EAR AND THE EARPIECE as we HEAR the awful SCRITCHING SCRAPE of STEEL FINGERKNIVES. NANCY slaps the phone down as if it were diseased then, in pure rage, rips the thing's cord from the wall. Spent instantly, she puts the receiver back on the cradle and lays it on her bed, chiding herself.
NANCY: Brilliant. Now what if Glen
NANCY: I'm awake, I am awake. This is not a dream! I am
NANCY: ( furious ) Give me the key, mother.
MARGE: I don't even have it on me, so forget it.
NANCY: SMASH CUT TO:
GLEEENNNNNN!: SMASH CUT TO:
NANCY: Okay, Krueger, you bastard. We play in your court.
PARKER: Lieutenant. It's your daughter. Says it's urgent.
LT THOMPSON: ( low ) Tell her I'm not here, tell Uh, she just saw you, sir.
PARKER: Uh, she just saw you, sir.
NANCY: Hi daddy. I know what happened.
LT THOMPSON: Then you know more than I do I haven't even been upstairs.
NANCY: ( guessing ) You know he's dead though, right?
LT THOMPSON: Yeah, apparantly he's dead. How the hell'd you know?
NANCY: I've got a proposition for you. Listen very carefully, Nan, I

NANCY: Fred Krueger did it, Daddy, and only I can get him. It's my nightmare he comes to.
LT THOMPSON: Where'd you hear about Krueger
NANCY: I want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now can you do that?
LT THOMPSON: Sure, but.
NANCY: That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
LT THOMPSON: Sure, sure, honey. You just do that get yourself some sleep that's what I've been saying all along.
NANCY: And you'll be here to catch him, right?
PARKER: Lieutenant they're waiting
LT THOMPSON: Sure, okay, I'll be there. Now you just turn in and get some rest, sweetheart. Please.
NANCY: NANCY hangs up. LT THOMPSON starts upstairs. But then he stops, and as an afterthought he could never really explain, turns to
PARKER: 'Anything funny' like what?
LT THOMPSON: I don't know but one thing for sure, I don't want her coming over here. She's way too far gone to be able to to handle this.
COP: ( faint ) What the hell did that, Lieutenant? There ain't even a head left.
LT THOMPSON: Goddamed if I know. What's the Coronor say?
COP: He's in the john puking since he saw it.
MARGE: Guess I should'n'a done it.
NANCY: Just sleep now, Mom.
MARGE: Just wanted to protect you, Nan. Just wanted to protect

MR LANTZ: He done it.
LT THOMPSON: Who? Who did that?
MR LANTZ: LT THOMPSON
LT THOMPSON: The father gives him the strangest look.
MR LANTZ: Had to've done it. No one else was in there.
LT THOMPSON: How you know that?
MR LANTZ: Cause I thought Glen was gonna sneak out to see your lunatic daughter, that's why. So I locked him in his room! Sorry. Anyways, the door was still locked when we heard the

NANCY: Help! Hey Daddy I got him trapped! Where are you!?
PARKER: ( yelling up at her ) Everything's going to be all right! Everything's under Get my father, you asshole!
NANCY: Get my father, you asshole!
MARGE: She blocks the charge perfectly blocking the knives. Both she and NANCY are slammed backwards against the bars Drunk though she is, is hanging onto KRUEGER'S weapon hand, keeping the knives inside herself, away from her daughter!
MARGE: Nancy for god's sake's run!
NANCY: Daddy! Where are you!
PARKER: Poor woman's got her hands full with that kid. Maybe I better tell the lieutenant.
NANCY: Hey fuckface can't catch
NANCY: ( screaming ) Come on he's in here! Daddy! Don't let him kill me too!
KRUEGER: Ready for these?
