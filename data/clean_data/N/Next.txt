CRIS: And "we" is.?
CLOCK: Minutes whiz by.
PLASMA SCREEN: Clips play and change almost too fast to be recognized.
WAITRESS: On cris
CRIS: Just the check.
CRIS: Try that one, man. I've got a Then you play it.
CRIS: Against my religion.
CRIS: Do it, quick, before somebody else gets there.
FERRIS: Call me, like they did. And try to hold him till I get here.
WAITRESS: What's your pleasure?
CRIS: Grand Dad, rocks.
WAITRESS: What's your pleasure?
CRIS: Scuse me, sorry.
DAVIS: I don't see an earphone on him.
FERRIS: ( stands ) Give me a headset. I'm going down
FERRIS: You! I just need to talk to you!
FERRIS: Homeland Security!
JEANNIE: We found a dirty bomb in East Vegas. A barrel of C-4 and a kilo of nuclear waste. But we're getting chatter about a dozen more out there somewhere, ready to blow.
JEANNIE: ( snide ) Another remote viewer?
FERRIS: I need six men to bring him in.
WISDOM: We're on Code Orange.
WISDOM: That's an ultra low probability. None of your "specials" have ever panned out, and this isn't the time to experiment.
FERRIS: Come on, Eric, you saw it. We're flying blind and he's got radar.
WISDOM: Callie, people are talking. They say I'm only funding your research because we're involved.
WISDOM: I'm sorry, but they're right.
WISDOM: I'm sorry, but they're right.
FERRIS: You bastard.
WISDOM: I care about you, and I wanted to support you. But there's a limit to what I can.
FERRIS: ( professional ) Look, we analyzed what this ability would look like if it existed.
FERRIS: ( beat ) I've got a country to protect.
WISDOM: Use your charm on somebody else.
CRIS: Guy around?
MANAGER: You are?
CRIS: Tell him it's King Midas.
FERRIS: Terry? Terry! - I know you've got your hands full but I was wondering if you might be able to spare a few warm bodies for an outside
BAINES: We're strictly internal.
FERRIS: That's why I need your people. Everybody else is assigned.
BAINES: Does Wisdom know about this?
FERRIS: He suggested it.
AMANDA: ( corrects herself ) Agent Ferris. I've got a face match on your subject. His name is Cris
CRIS: I need to cash some chips. - Got
GUY: You burned through your stash I've been trying to lay low.
CRIS: I've been trying to lay low.
CAVANAUGH: You showed me yours. I'll show you
CRIS: ( slurred ) He was gonna kill you! You all would'a died!
CRIS: That was the night Donna broke off our engagement.
GUY: I was so drunk I could barely see
CRIS: I was so drunk I could barely see
GUY: Well, I hope you don't mind. I called Neal to let him know you're Christ, Guy, did you have to?
CRIS: Christ, Guy, did you have to?
GUY: You say everything's inevitable, so I guess I did.
CRIS: Well, you can save your breath. Cause I know what you're gonna say.
GUY: Then you're aware that Neal is in a serious cash crunch and could lose it all.
CRIS: I'm sorry to hear that. But I'm done playing the market.
GUY: Neal's got it all worked out. He'll fly you out of the country on his jet. Put you up in style. He pays taxes, totally legal. You get cash, squeaky clean. Half the net. When your share hits fifty mil, you can say "finito".and it's over.
CRIS: Except last time, Neal didn't take "finito" for an answer.
GUY: You need us, asshole! The Law is breathin' down your neck!
CRIS: I can stay ahead of `em forever.
GUY: But why live that way?
CRIS: Because I don't want to be used any What do you give a shit as long as you get what you want?
GUY: What do you give a shit as long as you get what you want?
CRIS: Cause what I want is freedom. And you don't get it by giving it up.
CRIS: Enjoy it while it lasts.
CRIS: Looking for this?
CRIS: Don't mess with somebody who knows your moves before you even think
GUY: The jet'll be sold in a week. Then there goes your ticket out.
CRIS: Don't wait for me.
CAVANAUGH: He's just some gambler. Lives completely off the grid. No bank account. No credit cards. No previous record.
CAVANAUGH: Must be a wacko. He'd never met the victim. No connection whatsoever.
CAVANAUGH: You saw. He's got eyes in the back of his head. He can see around corners. I even had him in custody once, and he disappeared.
CAVANAUGH: And what is it you want him for?
CAVANAUGH: Stuff that hasn't happened yet.
CAVANAUGH: Well, I guess Homeland Security trumps liquor store murder. How can I help?
IRV: What are you doing back here?
CRIS: I came to fix you dinner.
IRV: Irv pulls Cris inside. Closes the door.
IRV: This is what you get from two packs a day.
IRV: It was already too late. I just didn't know it.
CRIS: Sometimes not knowing is better.
IRV: Look where you're headed, pal. The big decisions are over before you even realize you made `em.
GUY: I've got a little problem with the IRS. Think I could get some relief?
FERRIS: Depends how helpful you are.
FERRIS: I need to speak to him alone.
GUY: And another thing, no woman ever turns him down, I'm serious. Mainly because he only propositions the ones he knows'll say yes, which is most of `em anyway. But does that make him happy? No. Says he's bored. Never surprised. Has to watch himself die over and over Why'd he come back to Vegas?
FERRIS: Why'd he come back to Vegas?
GUY: Didn't say, but I'm guessin' it's this friend who's dying. An old fart who took him in when he was strung out on drugs. - He's an orphan, ya know. Been on the road since he was ten.
IRV: You want my advice? Get yourself a good lawyer and turn yourself in.
CRIS: If I tell `em the truth, you know what happens? I end up with the Feds. - And you know what they do to me?
IRV: Make you a secret agent.
IRV: Dan Rather or Peter Jennings?
CRIS: It's not funny, Irv. That's all I do, day after day, for the rest of my life. Watch the news until I lose my hair and croak.
CRIS: The best I can do is stay away from all of `em.
IRV: In that case, you've gotta leave the country.
CRIS: I know, I know, but there's something I gotta do first.
IRV: Cris doesn't answer. His gaze is distant.
IRV: Cris focuses.
CRIS: She's coming here. The Fed.
IRV: You gotta go?
CRIS: Let's play it out.
CRIS: I've got the place all picked out. It's called Palau. Three hundred teeny islands in the South Pacific. Nothing ever happens there, so there's nothing to foresee.
IRV: Then what the hell are you waiting
CRIS: I haven't met her yet.
IRV: I haven't met her yet.
CRIS: I haven't met her yet.
IRV: Then find somebody else!
CRIS: It has to be her.
IRV: What's so special about this one?
CRIS: She's the mother of my child.
IRV: I thought you were shooting blanks.
CRIS: I guess the doctors were wrong.
IRV: I don't mean to be indelicate, my friend, but how do you know the little bastard is yours?
CRIS: He's got my thing.
IRV: Your thing?
CRIS: My thing.
IRV: I still don't understand why you never got that fixed.
CRIS: Agent Ferris, come in.
FERRIS: One step ahead of the game.
CRIS: Let's go in the kitchen. I've got a roast in the oven.
FERRIS: You're wasting your life, Cris. You have the most amazing talent, and you're running from it.
CRIS: Yeah, people say I could have been a chef.
FERRIS: Now if you say that man in the liquor store was going to shoot five people, I believe you. Why else would you kill a stranger?
FERRIS: But no good deed goes unpunished, And that's how it's going to be in this world. People will either hate you or want to exploit you.
CRIS: Everyone but you, of course.
FERRIS: I can fix your legal problems. More importantly, I can give you a chance to use your gift.
CRIS: Trust me, it's better if I don't. It's better if I just mind my own
FERRIS: I'll be honest with you, Cris. That's not an option. Your country needs you. And if we don't grab you, somebody else will.
CRIS: Nobody's grabbed me yet.
FERRIS: I'd like you to come with me for some testing. Would you be willing to do that?
FERRIS: Where are you going?
FERRIS: ( temporarily blinded ) Shit! Cavanaugh!
IRV: In that case, you've gotta leave the country.
CRIS: I know, I know, I've got the place picked out. But there's something I've gotta do first.
IRV: Cris doesn't answer. His gaze is distant.
IRV: Cris focuses.
CRIS: I have to go.
IRV: You just got here.
CRIS: I know, but they're coming for me.
CRIS: This is for nurses and stuff, to make things a little easier.
IRV: You're gonna need it.
IRV: I don't suppose you've discovered any last minute escape for me?
CRIS: I looked, Irv, I really did. I went down every path, every treatment. Sometimes there's just no.
IRV: It's okay. It's okay.Now I can
FERRIS: I need him alive, Cavanaugh. Even if he resists.
CAVANAUGH: Yes, ma'am.
FERRIS: Tell them.
FERRIS: That's very helpful information.
CRIS: Mind if I join you?
LIZ: ( prickly ) Yeah, actually I do.
CRIS: Is that cruller any good?
CRIS: Shopping for a car?
LIZ: What business is it of yours?
CRIS: Rough day?
LIZ: Aw Christ! Look what you've done!
CRIS: I'm so sorry. I'm a spaz.
LIZ: Yeah, you are.
LIZ: It looked like you spilled it on Why would I do that?
CRIS: Why would I do that?
LIZ: I don't know. To impress me?
CRIS: Look, I'm sorry. If I could, I'd do it over.
CRIS: She watches as he sops up the coffee and carries dripping, soggy tissues to the trash. The miserable expression on his face finally wins the smile he's been working for.
CRIS: Well, Liz, your luck's about to How's that?
LIZ: How's that?
CRIS: You met me.
LIZ: And what are you, a leprechaun?
CRIS: An angel, actually. And we always reward the people who help us.
LIZ: Great, what do I have to do?
CRIS: You don't have to do anything.
CRIS: But I could use a ride.
LIZ: When does the luck kick in?
CRIS: It already has.
LIZ: I don't feel anything.
CRIS: Not even a tingle?
LIZ: Son, I haven't had a tingle in eight months.
CRIS: Then you're way overdue. For a reversal of fortune.
CRIS: Any kids?
LIZ: ( off his look ) I teach fifth grade.
CRIS: I mean of your own.
CRIS: I guess that's good. Considering.
LIZ: No, that was the problem. - I couldn't get pregnant.
CRIS: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry.
LIZ: You didn't. I'm just running off at the mouth. - That's why I was in Vegas. To see another doctor.
CRIS: He didn't want to adopt?
LIZ: No, he had to have a Randy Junior.
LIZ: What, is there an accident?
LIZ: When does the luck kick in?
CRIS: It already has.
LIZ: I don't feel anything.
CRIS: ( urgent ) Take this exit. Quick!
LIZ: Just take it!
CRIS: Just take it!
LIZ: It's too late!
CRIS: No it's not!
LIZ: Let go! Are you out of your mind?!
LIZ: Get out!
CRIS: Traffic was piling up. You didn't see it?
LIZ: GET OUT!! We could'a been stuck there for I don't give a flyin' goddamn! You don't grab the steering wheel!
GET OUT!!: We could'a been stuck there for I don't give a flyin' goddamn! You don't grab the steering wheel!
CRIS: We could'a been stuck there for I don't give a flyin' goddamn! You don't grab the steering wheel!
LIZ: I don't give a flyin' goddamn! You don't grab the steering wheel!
CRIS: You're right. I'm sorry. I panicked. I get phobic sitting in traffic. It won't happen again, I Damn straight, cause you won't be in the car!
LIZ: Damn straight, cause you won't be in the car!
CRIS: How `bout at the next gas station? Please. I'll fill up your tank.
FERRIS: Long enough to know we're not gonna catch him by surprise.
CAVANAUGH: What, you think he's got some kind of radar?
FERRIS: Interesting idea. It'd explain a whole lot.
CAVANAUGH: And Area 51 would explain my missing tennis shoes. But that doesn't mean they're on a flying
FERRIS: In this case, it does.
CRIS: I am really really really really
CAVANAUGH: I'd call your proof a little iffy.
FERRIS: Look, from your own experience, this guy can't be punched, shot, surprised, captured, or confined. So either he's got something special, or you're an idiot.
CAVANAUGH: Let's say I'm not an idiot.
FERRIS: And I'm not saying you are.
CAVANAUGH: Then what?
FERRIS: We've got to think like he does. We've got to think ahead.
CRIS: But lately I've been traveling all around Oregon. It's really peaceful up there.
LIZ: All right, I'm starting getting the picture. - Basically, you're a no- good, worthless ramblin' man who's never held a job in life.
CRIS: ( smiles )
LIZ: This is where I turn into town.
CRIS: Well, thanks for the ride.
LIZ: Thanks for the card.
CRIS: You're welcome.
LIZ: No, no, I've gotta teach tomorrow.
CRIS: I understand.Well, see ya.
LIZ: So long.
LIZ: Well, maybe just a quick one.
LIZ: Hey, George.
LIZ: I'll take the usual and he'll have Sierra Pale.
CRIS: Sierra Pale.
LIZ: He's not here now, is he?
LIZ: She turns to Cris.
LIZ: We gotta split. My ex is here.
LIZ: Sure, Randy. I'll call you
CRIS: Just a friend.
LIZ: I'm not yours anymore, asshole!
RANDY: You still care for me, I know it.
CRIS: Easy, man.
LIZ: Get out of here! Get out!
MOMENTS BEFORE: You still care for me, I know it.
RANDY: You still care for me, I know it.
CRIS: Easy, man.
LIZ: Stop it, Randy! Stop it!
LIZ: Get out of here! Get out!
LIZ: Oh God, I'll take you to the emergency room.
CRIS: No ho'pital. I don' nee' ho'pital.
LIZ: God, I hate that bastard.Will somebody get some ice!
CRIS: I'm sorry I'm causing you all this Are you kidding? You stood up for Actually, I wasn't standing for that long.
LIZ: Are you kidding? You stood up for Actually, I wasn't standing for that long.
CRIS: Actually, I wasn't standing for that long.
LIZ: Sorry it's so cold in here. The heater's broken.
LIZ: I really should've left him a long time ago. God knows he deserved it.
CRIS: Why didn't you?
LIZ: Cause I don't leave. I never have. My boyfriends always left me.
LIZ: I get attached to people, and then I'll put up with anything.
CRIS: What a terrible quality. You're too
LIZ: Sit in the light.
LIZ: I never minded that I was the more devoted one. Somebody's gotta be more this or more that.
LIZ: But they never appreciate it, that you're there for them.
LIZ: They just try and get away with more and more, and figure you'll
LIZ: It gets more intense.
LIZ: Christ, I don't even know you. I have no idea who you are.
LIZ: Sorry to get you caught up in my soap opera.
CRIS: Once you start watching, it's hard not to get involved.
LIZ: You ever been married?
CRIS: What happened?
LIZ: What happened?
CRIS: She wanted kids.
LIZ: And you didn't?
CRIS: It's just that.I can't.
LIZ: Why are you telling me this? These personal details.
CRIS: I don't know. You asked and.I guess I felt like you'd understand.
CRIS: That was incredible.
CRIS: He kisses her with a quiet intensity that quickly ignites.
LIZ: That was.I've never.
WISDOM: So basically we've got nothing.
WISDOM: You're failing your country, people. You're not trying hard Do you understand what I'm saying? Do you understand what I expect from you?
HAPPEN!: He has blown them wide-eyed.
WISDOM: ( suddenly calm ) Are there any questions?
FERRIS: You know you're very sexy when you're ruthless.
WISDOM: We're groping in the dark.
FERRIS: My guy's got a flashlight. We just need to bring him in.
WISDOM: I'll see if Baines can spare some
LIZ: What the hell are you doing?
CRIS: You said it was broken.
LIZ: Well, you're not leaving till it's fixed, I'll tell you that.
LIZ: As long as it's done right.
FERRIS: This one first.
BAINES: What is it?
FERRIS: A trap for somebody who can see the If you say so.
BAINES: If you say so.
FERRIS: And then these.
LIZ: And what was the main staple of their diet?
LIZ: From the lake?
SHY GIRL: No. From the rivers.
LIZ: Right. And the Washo were so jealous of their fishing grounds that when other Native Americans came to trade for dried fish, they were only permitted to remain one
LIZ: What are you doing here?
LIZ: Ice cream sandwiches? Do you have any idea how much fat they have in them? Don't you see how overweight half of them are?
CRIS: ( crestfallen ) I - I didn't think of it. - I thought you'd be happy to see me.
LIZ: Well next time exercise a little forethought, okay?
CRIS: Do you want me to leave these All right then. I'll just go.
LIZ: All right then. I'll just go.
CRIS: All right then. I'll just go.
LIZ: Put a few in the freezer. I love ice cream sandwiches.
LIZ: You have been such a bad influence. I'm gonna be up all night grading
CRIS: I've got a better idea. Run away with me to the South Pacific.
LIZ: Funny. We've only known each other a week.
CRIS: But we're going to be happy together for the rest of our lives. Really, I peeked.
LIZ: I think you're serious.
CRIS: She muses, tempted.
CRIS: Let's go pack your bags. We'll leave tonight.
LIZ: And what'll we do for money?
CRIS: Don't worry. That's always been easy for me.
LIZ: This is ridiculous.
CRIS: Well, first of all, it's the middle of the school year.
LIZ: Well, first of all, it's the middle of the school year.
CRIS: They'll replace you.
LIZ: And I'm in charge of science fair.
CRIS: They can pick up the slack.
LIZ: It disturbs me, Cris, that you think it's okay just to duck your
CRIS: I - I don't think it's okay. I'm not that kind of person. But I have this feeling, this very strong feeling, that it has to be now. We have to leave soon, or it's not gonna work out.
LIZ: I don't believe that. If it's meant to be between two people, somehow it'll happen.
CRIS: Yes, but sometimes you have to make it happen. You have to seize the opportunity before it's too late.
LIZ: What are you afraid of, Cris? Why are you running away from yourself?
CRIS: Your students are very lucky.
LIZ: Now I've got to grade papers.
CRIS: But then you have to sign the divorce papers.
RANDY: approaches RICK, a young LOCAL POLICEMAN who's not the sharpest knife in the drawer.
LIZ: Ignoring them, Cris turns toward the street where he saw the accident take place. He sees kids, but they're jumping rope. Wrong group. He scans around and finds the kids who are playing softball. Someone misses a catch. The ball rolls toward the street. The sports car is now coming fast. The woman jogger sees the errant ball and runs to fetch it.
CRIS: I said I'll pay.
DRIVER: You're damn right you'll pay! I wanna talk to the cops.
CRIS: No need for that. I'll give you cash. Okay? Will you take cash?
DRIVER: Make it three.
CRIS: Okay, three.
LIZ: So you throw rocks at them?
CRIS: What do you want me to do? Wait for people to die?
LIZ: Cris.I think you should move on.
CRIS: Look, there's something I've been wanting to tell you.
LIZ: It doesn't matter.
CRIS: It does.
CAVANAUGH: I know.
LIZ: What are you saying, you're some sort of prophet?
CRIS: It's not religious. I just happen to see my life before it happens.
LIZ: Cris, it's sweet that you feel responsible for people. But I think you need help.
CRIS: Flip it.
LIZ: Just do it.
CRIS: Just do it.
CRIS: She looks. It's heads.
CRIS: Flip it again.
CRIS: ( she looks;flips again ) ( she looks, flips again )
CRIS: Now you believe me?
LIZ: Yeah. And I don't want to have anything to do with you.
CRIS: ( follows ) Don't you see? I can get us all the money we need.
LIZ: Don't follow me. Don't talk to me. Get out of my life!
LIZ: Cris.I think you should move on.
CRIS: Why? Because I care so much about kids that sometimes I overreact?
POLICEMAN RICK: Hard to say. She's impossible to Sounds like you've tried.
POLICEMAN RICK: She's quite a challenge.
LIZ: I swear, I can't figure you out.
CRIS: Believe me, the feeling is mutual.
LIZ: Sometimes you seem mindlessly impulsive. But other times I feel like you're utterly calculating, saying exactly what you think'll push my buttons.
CRIS: What do you mean?
LIZ: Don't you think it's kind of an amazing coincidence that neither of us can have kids?
CRIS: You want to talk to my doctor? I'll get him on the phone. No, really, I mean it. I'll have him send you my records. Because I want you to trust me.
LIZ: Then open up. Talk to me. Where are you going with your life?
CRIS: All the time. - But mainly how to stay out of trouble.
LIZ: No goals? Dreams? Ambitions?
CRIS: There's only one thing I've ever What's that?
LIZ: What's that?
CRIS: A family.
LIZ: That's all? Just a family?
CRIS: Well, I was, as they say, left on a doorstep when I was two. Never found foster parents who could put up with me. - So to me, a family sounds like plenty.
LIZ: You've got to be making this up.
CRIS: I wish.
LIZ: You poor guy.
CAVANAUGH: I say we get the whole department up here and bust his ass.
CAVANAUGH: Then why won't he see through your
LIZ: I'll meet you inside. I need to pick something up at the drug
FERRIS: Stay in the car. If he sees your shadow, he won't take the bait.
CAVANAUGH: You haven't been chasing him for three years.
LIZ: Agent Ferris.
FERRIS: Agent Ferris.
LIZ: He's not a killer. He needs help.
LIZ: ( aghast ) You're not gonna let them.
FERRIS: That's why I came to you.
LIZ: Okay, I'll talk to him. I'll try to get him to.
FERRIS: Even his best friend says he'll never turn himself in. - At this stage, there's only one way to keep him from self-destructing.
LIZ: I ran into a friend I hadn't seen in a while.
LIZ: She said we could use her cabin up at the peak.
CRIS: God, this is gorgeous.
CRIS: What's wrong?
LIZ: She hops out of the truck.
FERRIS: But silently, right?
BAINES: And that's when we go in.
CAVANAUGH: And that's when we go in.
FERRIS: Gentlemen, try to think like him. - If the plan is to go in right after he's trapped, he'll see it coming and he'll slip away before he's Like he's always done.
FERRIS: And if he doesn't know he's trapped, he can't foresee knowing he's trapped.
CAVANAUGH: That kinda makes sense.
FERRIS: The eureka moment is when he realizes he's been trapped.
CAVANAUGH: When is that?
FERRIS: Cavanaugh and Rick nod with a kind of awe.
RICK: You're smart.
LIZ: Cris. Do you think we met for a You mean, do I believe a higher power brought us together?
CRIS: You mean, do I believe a higher power brought us together?
LIZ: No. I think we're just the last in a long chain of accidents that started with the Big Bang.
CRIS: No. I think we're just the last in a long chain of accidents that started with the Big Bang.
LIZ: That's not very romantic.
CRIS: Oh, but it is. Think of it: For us to meet, everything from the very beginning, every sub-atomic event, every galactic cataclysm, every step of evolution, every act, every accident, every decision in the history of the universe had to happen exactly the way it did just so you and I could be together, right here and now.
CRIS: To whatever happens next.
LIZ: I shouldn't.
CRIS: ( concerned ) I'm late.
LIZ: I'm late.
CRIS: That's why I went to the drug store. To get a pregnancy test.
LIZ: That's why I went to the drug store. To get a pregnancy test.
LIZ: You know what this means?
CRIS: I do now.
LIZ: How did it.?
CRIS: I have no idea. Unless.But that still doesn't explain.
CRIS: Liz, I really did have this problem. I wasn't lying to you.
CRIS: But this is good. This is amazing. I want this baby more than
LIZ: It's like a miracle.
CRIS: For both of us.
FERRIS: Women hate good-looking men. Rejecting them makes us feel And that's more important than No. But she doesn't really love
FERRIS: No. But she doesn't really love
FERRIS: Snapback TO:
CRIS: You lying bitch! You betrayed me!
CRIS: ( whispers ) Liz, please, I love you.
CRIS: Let me talk to you for one minute. I won't hurt you, I promise.
LIZ: Cris, I know you don't mean to hurt people. But you need help or you're going to keep on hurting them.
CRIS: The man I killed was there to rob the store. He was going to panic and shoot five innocent people.
LIZ: How do you know this?
CRIS: Because I saw them die.
LIZ: Like yesterday, with the car?
CRIS: You were afraid something bad might happen so you.
LIZ: You were afraid something bad might happen so you.
CRIS: Not "might"! Those people died! - They just hadn't died yet.
LIZ: What if you hadn't done anything? Have you ever waited to see what would happen?
CRIS: The trauma replays on his face.
CRIS: That's why I don't go out much. So I won't be there to see.
CAVANAUGH: What's taking so long?
BAINES: We could just do this the old- fashioned way.
LIZ: Cris, you're a good man. And I will stand by you through this. But you have to.
CRIS: If they catch me, they'll put me in a cell without a trial, and they'll never let me out. They do that, you I won't let it happen. I'll get you a lawyer.
LIZ: I won't let it happen. I'll get you a lawyer.
LIZ: He snaps out of it.
CRIS: There's one decent path. But if we're gonna stay on it, I need you to do exactly what I say.
CRIS: Will you give me one chance? One chance in exchange for a miracle?
STAKEOUT SITE: Ferris, Cavanaugh, Baines, and Rick are getting worried.
FERRIS: Okay. Wait for my signal.
CRIS: A few steps on, your robe will get caught on a thornbush. You won't be able to get unstuck. Ferris and a tough guy will come help you. She'll say, "You've done your country a great service."
LIZ: And then?
CRIS: Be unpredictable. Surprise works to my advantage. - And read this when you're safe.
LIZ: Will I see you again?
CRIS: Bet on it.
CAVANAUGH: ( disappointed, via radio ) We stand pat till notified. Don't make a sound.
FERRIS: What's she waiting for?
ON LIZ: As predicted, the hem of her robe gets caught in the thorns. She tries to pull free, but she's stuck.
LIZ: Then why do I feel like a traitor?
STAKEOUT SITE: Baines and Ferris help Liz back to their camp.
CAVANAUGH: ( relays a message ) We've got movement in the canyon. ( to radio ) Where are you?
CAVANAUGH: We tried it your way.
CAVANAUGH: Boys, now it's our turn.
FERRIS: I want him alive. Tell them.
TROOPERS: Spread out through the steep terrain. SEARCHLIGHT BEAMS sweep over the landscape.
CRIS: moves erratically, presciently, in bursts, dodging the streaking spots of glare.
FERRIS: You've made a very stupid mistake.
LIZ: I trust him more than I trust you.
LIZ: You've never even met him.
FERRIS: But I've profiled him for months. And I can tell you this: he doesn't love anybody. How could he? To him, we're not even human.
TROOPER 1: I'm trying!
FERRIS: ( shakes her head ) I underestimated him.
FERRIS: By a lot.
THE HUNT: Cris gets pinned down behind a tree. A Trooper keeps firing, trying to drive him from hiding. Cris boldly comes out from cover and runs, giving the Trooper a clear shot. But the Trooper runs out of ammo at just that moment.
FERRIS: ( to radio and Baines ) Change of plans, everybody.
FERRIS: No, it's an order.
FERRIS: There's only one way to beat this man. He's got to see his own death, and not just maybe. He's got to see himself die again and again and know it's inescapable. And then, maybe, he'll surrender.
FERRIS: That'll be his choice. And he was no use to us anyway.
BAINES: Damn. Fifty men might not be Somehow we've got to bring him down to our level.
FERRIS: Somehow we've got to bring him down to our level.
FERRIS: I'm workin' on it.
BAINES: He's crossed over into Maxwell Move in fast. Keep him moving. Don't let him rest.
FERRIS: Move in fast. Keep him moving. Don't let him rest.
FERRIS: Don't give him time to look ahead. That's the key.
BAINES: He's heading this way.
MAXWELL GORGE: Thirty Troopers and Six MP's are converging on Cris.
MAXWELL GORGE: Cris moves toward a field of LARGE BOULDERS.
MAXWELL GORGE: Troopers and MP's are closing in on Cris.
MAXWELL GORGE: Troopers and MP's are advancing toward Cris, about to open
CAVANAUGH: This is your last warning.
STAKEOUT SITE: Ferris and Baines watch the events below.
LIZ: fishtails down the twisting mountain road.
MAXWELL GORGE: Cris practically mud-skis down the slope.
CRIS: Believe me now?
LIZ: I'm getting used to miracles.
CRIS: Where were you going?
LIZ: No idea. I was just trying to be
LIZ: So what's the plan? Bonnie and Remember that place in the South It's starting to sound really good.
LIZ: It's starting to sound really good.
CRIS: I'll check on our ride.
LIZ: Will we make it?
CRIS: Right now I'm just trying to stay
MOUNTAIN ROAD: Rick's Police Cruiser swings over the side and tumbles down a steep slope. There will be no survivors.
LIZ: Christ, you live dangerously.
CRIS: Just the opposite. I never take
STAKEOUT SITE: As a Federal Chopper idles, Ferris marks up a ROAD MAP of the area with X's.
FERRIS: ( to radio ) Cavanaugh, get all your men into ( waits ) Cavanaugh? Tell them.
FERRIS: You take command of the chase. Have cars block these intersection.
BAINES: Why these?
FERRIS: Get in the chopper.
MOUNTAIN ROAD: Cris takes blind curves at high speed.
CRIS: Did the doctors ever say why you couldn't have kids?
LIZ: I grew up at Love Canal.
CRIS: What's that?
LIZ: A neighborhood back East built over a chemical dump. A bunch of my friends had birth defects. I always figured I was lucky just to be sterile.
CRIS: Except you're not. And neither am I. We're different, that's all. We just had to find the right match.
LIZ: And somehow we did.
BAINES: ( discouraged ) He doesn't miss a beat.
FERRIS: ( pleased, to herself ) Come to momma.
FERRIS: ( to radio ) Stay after him. Keep the pressure
BAINES: ( incredulous ) He's driving right into it.
BAINES: Sometimes looking one step ahead isn't enough.
LIZ: You make it look easy.
CRIS: Oh shit. Oh no.
CRIS: I blew it.
FERRIS: I need your vehicle.
BAINES: What's the plan?
FERRIS: Playing chicken.
BAINES: Don't be stupid! He knows what you'll do!
FERRIS: But so do I. And for once, that makes us even.
THE BRIDGE: Cris slams on the brakes. Stops the car. Police cars stop behind him, blocking retreat.
CRIS: GET OUT! NOW! OR YOU'LL DIE!
HUMMER: Ferris gathers her determination and floors it.
ON CRIS: CRIS' VISIONS: Fast forward to the HEAD ON COLLISION! Then a COLLAGE of ALTERNATE CHOICES AND OUTCOMES: Cris swerves; slams on the brakes; gets shot making a run for the rail; spins out on the roadbed; crashes over the side, over the side, over the side! But in every version, the Hummer is unchanging. Unrelenting. Dead on.
FERRIS: Total focus. No doubts or decisions.
ON CRIS: He drives toward a specific segment of railing between two light posts.
THE BRIDGE: Rick's Cruiser crashes through the railing and plunges over the side of the bridge.
A HELICOPTER: flies over him.
CRIS: Still on the rock. Looks up and sees a cable being lowered from the helicopter. He looks around? Is there another way out? Out of choices, he reaches for the cable. Misses! Loses his balance. Flails. At the last second, he steadies himself.
FERRIS: Watches through binoculars as Cris snaps one cuff around his wrist and waits. She shouts into her radio.
FERRIS: Cuffs on both wrists. Leave him if he doesn't.
FERRIS: I don't want to find out.
FERRIS: I was wrong about one thing. He is capable of love.
HELICOPTER: Descends, with Cris hanging below by a cable. MP's are waiting below with a tarp which they wrap around Cris, then tape him like a mummy, up to his neck. When he's bound as securely as Hannibal Lecter, Ferris steps close and gets her first good look at him.
CRIS: Why does everybody have amnesia but I only ask one thing from you. Give me a chance to earn your trust.
FERRIS: I only ask one thing from you. Give me a chance to earn your trust.
FERRIS: Then give me another chance. You get `em all the time.
CRIS: Don't let them know you're
LIZ: I promise.
LIZ: Work with them Cris. So we can be
CRIS: I'll get us out of here. We can still make the plane.
FERRIS: This game was different. He knew I wouldn't flinch.
WISDOM: It's red now. And we're out of Then you better hope he's what I say he is.
WISDOM: Please, make me a believer.
WHITE VESTIBULE: Size of an elevator. Cris stands there, bound ankle and wrist. Click, the metal shackles open automatically and drop to the floor.
FERRIS: Not possible with him.
FERRIS: Cris, please step into the next
WHITE VESTIBULE: Cris gives up on the chains and sullenly steps forward.
WHITE ROOM: Size of a squash court. Cris enters gingerly and peers around. Twenty feet up, an OBSERVATION WINDOW, opaque. On the other walls, RIFLE BARRELS poke through NARROW SLITS. The door slides shut behind him.
FERRIS: Cris, we'll be firing at you with live ammo. Are you ready?
FERRIS: Now we are going to use live ammo.
WISDOM: Not on my watch, you're not.
FERRIS: I promise you, he won't be hit.
WISDOM: It's your experiment.
CRIS: "From now on, Cris, the bullets are
FERRIS: He's almost impossible to shoot, hit, surprise, capture, or contain.
WISDOM: Mind if I try?
FERRIS: Be my guest.
FERRIS: No minds to read. The guns are aimed automatically by infrared.
CRIS: I'm going. No need for a hotfoot.
CRIS: Ferris on monitor
CRIS: I know what happens.
CRIS: You tie me down and never let me
CRIS: Because you're trying to force me.
WISDOM: Whoa, you are one tough bitch.
FERRIS: We're still in a Code Red if I'm not mistaken.
WISDOM: He knew he'd get shocked, but he chose to resist.
FERRIS: He's almost never had to face Cris, are you ready to get in the
FERRIS: We need information, right?
FERRIS: Leave him there. We'll start again when he recovers.
WISDOM: Okay, how do we use him to find the Simple. We make him watch the news and tell us about it.
FERRIS: Simple. We make him watch the news and tell us about it.
WISDOM: How far ahead can he see?
FERRIS: I don't know. But I suspect we can increase his range with practice. Especially if we restrict his future to only watching news. Then he'll be like a timescope.
WISDOM: You were right. This is huge.
FERRIS: This is just for starters. You want to stage a pre-emptive strike, he can tell you if you'll hit the target and whether they hit back and what went wrong. And you can do this over and over until you get it perfect before you begin.
WISDOM: Right now, sweetheart, we can't even get him to sit in a chair.
WISDOM: We've got to think this through. Your friend could be more dangerous than the terrorists.
WISDOM: With this guy, you have to. Or it'll be over before it begins.
WISDOM: That may not be enough. We may have to cut off his arms and legs. Then I might start to feel safe.
WISDOM: Think about it. What we're talking about here is the next step in human evolution. And I'm not gonna make the same mistake the Neanderthals made when they ran across this good-looking Homo Sapien fellow and all the lady Neanderthals said, "He's so cute. Let's keep him around."
FERRIS: Can we deal with your sexual insecurities at another time?
WISDOM: You mean after it's too late?
FERRIS: I told you, he doesn't read minds. He sees the results.
WHITE ROOM: Cris rises from the floor into a crouched position, like an animal ready to pounce.
WHITE ROOM: Motionless, in a crouch.Cris suddenly dashes between two MP's, shoves them aside, makes for the door. He gets smashed by the RIFLE BUTTS of the nearest ones, then stomped by the full contingent. [Attempt #1]
WISDOM: Wait for my signal, then go in and surround him.
WISDOM: I'll do the talking.
WISDOM: Cris, this Eric Wisdom. I'm the director of this facility.
CRIS: I don't believe you.
WHITE ROOM: Cris runs to the door and tries to bar it so they can't enter. He gets shoved aside by the force of the MP's as they charge in. [Attempt #4]
WISDOM: ( to microphone ) Cris, time is running out.
OBSERVATION ROOM: Looking down at Cris, still crouched there, alone.
FERRIS: Don't give him time. Send them in Baines, do it.
WISDOM: Baines, do it.
CRIS: Don't get too attached to your arms and legs.
WISDOM: Don't let him out of here alive.
FERRIS: If there's one soft heart, one slow shooter, he'll know it.
WISDOM: Be careful. I don't want anything to happen to you.
WISDOM: No demerol. I need to be alert.
FERRIS: Get him a local.
FERRIS: Not now.
FERRIS: This is getting interesting. We have a mating pair.
WISDOM: Secure the female.
SOLDIER: ( to Liz ) We're here to protect you.
VENTILLATION DUCT: Cris, frustrated, shimmies back through the vent.
SURVEILLANCE ROOM: Leo checks all the video screens. Cris is nowhere.
VENTILLATION DUCT: Settling in, Cris looks at his watch. 5:17. He concentrates and time speeds by - until a flashlight beam lights up the duct from a distance.
SOLDIER: I found him! In here!
VENTILLATION DUCT: Which is once again dark, quiet and empty. Cris looks at his watch. 5:17.
EXPLORATION SEQUENCE: Cris drops down from a ventillator shaft into an office. He opens the door, walks into a corridor, and strides forward, preternaturally calm.
VENTILLATION DUCT: Cris, where he started, motionless as a hibernating bear, exploring his futures. CAMERA passes through walls, floors, ceilings and finds Baines rushing through the corridors. Baines enters.
BAINES: I'm issuing infrared to all my men. We should have a fix in a few You realize if he gets away now, we'll never get him back. He'll be out there, and he'll be our enemy.
WISDOM: You realize if he gets away now, we'll never get him back. He'll be out there, and he'll be our enemy.
FERRIS: We don't actually have to do We just have to decide to do
WISDOM: You want me to threaten to kill a pregnant woman?
FERRIS: Threats don't count. When he foresees that you actually did kill her, that she's dead. He won't let it happen. - He'll come to us. Surrender. And she'll
FERRIS: But it only works if we're not bluffing. Because he'll know.
CORRIDOR: Empty. A door opens. Cris steps out into the hall carrying the backpack and a foot stool. He stays close to a wall, steps on the foot stool, and spray-paints over the lens of a surveillance camera.
SURVEILLANCE ROOM: Leo spots Cris as he blinds one camera after another.
CORRIDOR: SOLDIER PETE and SOLDIER BRIAN charge into an empty corridor and begin their search for Cris.
SURVEILLANCE ROOM: Baines arrives and takes command.
CORRIDOR: SOLDIER JASON and THREE TROOPS are on the way, each with a
ANOTHER CORRIDOR: Cris lies in wait for the patrol. When they appear, he is perfectly placed to mace each dog and each soldier with a quick spritz. He goes back and sprays them again, to keep them out of commission.
LEO: He's on this floor!.Shit! He's coming here!
CORRIDOR: Emerging into the hallway, Cris looks down at the end of the hall and sees two MP's falling to the floor, wounded.
SURVEILLANCE ROOM: As the tear gas clears, the damage is visible. Every monitor in the surveillance system has been shattered. Leo, coughing, feels his way to a phone.
WISDOM'S OFFICE: Wisdom answers on speakerphone.
FERRIS: He's getting away.
CORRIDOR: Cris, on the run, encounters CRACK SHOT - not where he was seen in prevision. Crack Shot reaches for his gun. Cris breaks his arm before Crack Shot can fire.
WISDOM'S OFFICE: Wisdom on the phone. Ferris watching in suspense.
WISDOM: Any developments on the Code Red? .Let me know if there are.
WISDOM: Baines, bring the girl friend to the Interrogation Room. I'll deal with her there.
WAITING ROOM: Where Liz is being baby-sat by four MP's. Baines enters.
BAINES: We're moving her.
INTERROGATION ROOM: While the Guards stand on alert, Liz sits in a chair and discovers a piece of paper on a side table, placed exactly where her hand has come to rest. On the paper, in pencil, a square with a square cross within. She flips over the note. It reads, "GO CRAZY!"
INTERROGATION ROOM: The MP's force Liz into a chair behind a desk.
SOLDIER: Sit there and shut up.
CORRIDOR: Wisdom and Ferris, walking.
FERRIS: You understand what's at stake here? We're playing for the future. Not just what happens next, but what the future is. What the rules If one man will know it and control it and have power over the rest of us. Or if we'll have power over By killing an innocent woman.
WISDOM: By killing an innocent woman.
FERRIS: If you want, I'll pull the trigger.
WISDOM: I think that might be.more
FERRIS: I'll join you in a minute. I need to take care of some details.
WISDOM: Get more men up here.
INTERROGATION ROOM: Liz anxiously checks the clock. 5:43 and still no Wisdom. Then the door opens. And Wisdom enters.
FERRIS' OFFICE: She picks up the phone. Dials a number.
FERRIS: This is Ferris. I'll need a chopper tanked up and ready.
WISDOM: ( not listening ) Where the hell did she get the
CORRIDORS: Cris and Ferris make their way toward the entrance. They come across a Patrol. The MP's take aim. Cris holds his gun to Ferris' head.
PATROL LEADER: Hold your fire. We've got the target in plain sight in Corridor 2C, but he's holding a hostage. Agent Ferris. - Request
BAINES: You won't believe this. He's got I don't know, but he's on his way to the front door. They want instructions.
WISDOM: I don't know, but he's on his way to the front door. They want instructions.
BAINES: I don't know, but he's on his way to the front door. They want instructions.
WISDOM: Don't shoot.
BAINES: Then how are we going to stop him?
WISDOM: We don't. We let him go. - It's part of the plan.
BAINES: You're sure about this?
WISDOM: No, but Ferris is.
WISDOM: I hope he loves you as much as I love her.
CORRIDORS: Cris marches Ferris through the building, flanked by Security Police who aim at him but hold their fire. WISDOM'S VOICE comes over the public address system.
CRIS: ( to Ferris ) He hasn't got the balls.
FERRIS: We'll find out, won't we?
LIZ: You're not going to kill me. That's what the bad guys do.
WISDOM: In war, you have to be as ruthless as your enemy.
LIZ: ( emphatic ) Cris isn't the enemy.
WISDOM: I didn't mean him.
CORRIDORS: Near lobby, where Crack Shot repeatedly nailed Cris. This time Crack Shot's shooting arm is in a sling, and he crouches next to a substitute sniper, who lies in wait.
INTERROGATION ROOM: Wisdom and Liz. He watches the clock. Now she's afraid.
LIZ: Can't you just leave us alone?
CROSSHAIRS: As Cris enters the sniper's field of vision, he shifts Ferris to a different position, blocking the shot.
CORRIDOR: As they pass under him, Ferris sees the sniper above. Cris takes aim at an empty space and fires just as a soldier charges from hiding and absorbs the bullet as if deliberately catching it with his body.
FERRIS: God, you're remarkable.
FERRIS: I wish you had a little more sense of duty.
CRIS: I'd say you have way too much.
CRIS: Give me your keys.
CRIS: ( to soldier ) If I see you, I'll kill her.
WISDOM: I'm sorry.
FERRIS: You know what our problem is?
CRIS: "We got off on the wrong foot."
FERRIS: It's really.
CRIS: "all been a big misunderstanding."
FERRIS: "We've never meant you any harm."
CRIS: "We've never meant you any harm."
FERRIS: It sounds so insincere when you say I guess you're a better liar than I You know what I'm going to say
CRIS: I guess you're a better liar than I You know what I'm going to say
FERRIS: You know what I'm going to say
CRIS: It'll never happen.
FERRIS: My door will be open. We can start from scratch.
FERRIS: The magic word is cooperate. That's all we've ever wanted to hear from
CRIS: When are they going to give up? After you're dead?
CRIS: To a gang of murderers?
FERRIS: I see you got our message.
CRIS: What's about to happen.you've brought it on yourselves.
STAIRWELL: which he descends at a run, roughly dragging Ferris with him.
CRIS: I'm planning on it.
INTERROGATION ROOM: Wisdom keeps his gun aimed at Liz's head as he watches the clock: 5:55 PM.
CORRIDOR: Cris charges out of the stairwell, shooting without hesitation - forward, left, right, back - efficiently targeting Security Police in the precise order of their imminent readiness to fire at him. For each bullet, one soldier dies.
CRIS: Get out!
INTERROGATION ROOM: Wisdom holds Liz at arm's length with his gun pointed at her head. Watching the clock count up to 6:00 PM. It's 5:59:41/
THE LAB: Cris moves the bomb. Closes his eyes for a beat. Moves the bomb again. Closes his eyes. Opens them. Sets the detonator to 10 seconds.
INTERROGATION ROOM: Wisdom watches the clock count advance. 5:59:55/56/57.
CORRIDOR: Now empty. Cris runs for it. Dives.
INTERROGATION ROOM: As Wisdom prepares to the pull the trigger, the bomb explodes in a giant cataclysm.
LIZ: This is what they wanted you to I guess.
CRIS: I guess.
LIZ: And you wouldn't help?
CRIS: They didn't explain. They were trying to force me.
CRIS: Liz? Where are you going?
NEAL: She's not coming with us?
FERRIS: Where did you get this number?
FERRIS: That's music to my ears.
CRIS: But I have conditions.
FERRIS: I'm sure we can work something out.
CRIS: Her eyes flicker open. She sees him looking down at her like an angel.
CRIS: I can't. - I have to go.
LIZ: ( incredulous ) You're not leaving?
CRIS: There's something I have to do. Something you'd want me to do. And I can't put it off any longer.
LIZ: ( wounded ) Fine. Then go. What do I care?
CRIS: Liz, it's not like that. I searched for you for a long time. I want to be with you forever.
LIZ: Don't overdo it. We just met last But a lot has happened since then.
CRIS: But a lot has happened since then.
LIZ: While I was sleeping?
CRIS: We're going to have a child.
LIZ: Then you really are an angel.
CRIS: I don't expect you to believe me. But when you do find out, remember that we came together for a reason. That this wasn't just.one night. It was a special chance for both of
LIZ: Then why are you running away from
CRIS: I'm not.I'm taking the long way
LIZ: I don't understand. We got off to such a great start.
CRIS: And I looked for a happy ending. But this was the best I could do.
LIZ: See ya?
CRIS: I wouldn't be surprised.
CRIS: I wasn't ready till now.
FERRIS: We don't have time to waste. Maybe you could start by telling me how your talent works.
CRIS: "The future ain't what it used to be." Ever hear that expression?
