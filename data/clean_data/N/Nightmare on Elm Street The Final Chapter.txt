JACOB: Do you hear that? Hear what?
GREYHAIRED MAN: Hear what?
JACOB: That noise.
GREYHAIRED MAN: I don't hear anything.
JACOB: Excuse me.
STEWARDESS: The WHOOSHING is completely obvious now. The greyhaired man tries to ignore the two people talking over him.
JACOB: What is that sound?
STEWARDESS: That's just the engines, sir.
JACOB: No, it's different. It's not the engines. It's getting louder.
STEWARDESS: We're just gaining altitude to get above some rough weather. That's the sound of the engines speeding up a bit. Everything's fine.
JACOB: The stewardess walks away as Jacob sits back and starts to bite his nails. The whooshing is really starting to BLARE now. He looks between the seats in front of him twists around to look behind. He snaps back to the greyhaired man.
GREYHAIRED MAN: ( losing patience ) Look, kid. Will you relax? It's just the damn engines, okay?
THE CHILDREN: One two, Freddy's coming for you. Three four, better lock your door. Five six, grab your crucifix. Seven eight, gonna stay up late.
SCISSORS: Jacob twists his body, trying to steer his parachute away from the demons. One of the Skeletons swoops up to his face and pokes its scissors inches away from Jacob's eyes. It sings alone:
CHILD: Nine ten, never sleep again!
JACOB: The Skeletons nod "yes". SNIP - SNIP - SNIP - they cut away at Jacob's parachute as he swings underneath them, trying to pull away - SNIP - SNIP. The parachute flutters away - the Skeletons cackle - and Jacob plummets.
ON JACOB: We stay with him as he screams and shrieks and yells and the clouds part and the ground rises quickly up to meet him. The ground becomes a town, the town becomes a block, the block becomes a house, the house becomes a roof, and.
JACOB: ALICE JOHNSON opens the door and sticks her head in. She's thirty-two, blonde, with a caring smile.
ALICE: You okay, honey?
JACOB: Yeah, Mom. I'm fine.
ALICE: Alright. Better get cooking or you'll be late for school.
JACOB: On my way.
JACOB: Get the hell out of here! It's coming!
WOMAN: What's coming?
JACOB: Don't you see it?
WOMAN: See what? Kids.watcha gonna do?
FREDDY: Payback time.
JACOB: Don't worry, I have a strong stomach. Springwood is mine, boy!
FREDDY: Don't worry, I have a strong stomach. Springwood is mine, boy!
JACOB: I dreamed you away before I was born! Mom said you couldn't come back!
FREDDY: Is that true? Then she told you all about me, huh? Let's see what else she has to say.
ALICE: Run, Jacob! Leave her alone!
JACOB: Leave her alone!
FREDDY: You're such a momma's boy!
ON JACOB: as he runs to his mother. She VANISHES just as he reaches out to touch her bloody body. He turns to Krueger and raises his fists. A look of sheer rage is growing in him, blind, insane anger. He bellows:
JACOB: You fucker!
FREDDY: Springwood is only the beginning. All I need from you is a ride! See ya later!
SOUND COP: WAKE UP!
WAKE UP!: Jacob grabs his ears in pain as we suddenly:
JACOB: HONK! SCREECH! Jacob whips his head around in time to see a huge moving van blasting right at him. He rolls off to the side of the road. The truck barely misses him, kicking up a cloud of dust in its wake. Jacob chokes on the dust. He slowly recovers and looks back down at the bracelet in his hand. He clenches his fist around it as a wild-eyed angry look starts to grow on him. He takes a few deep breaths, then stands up and walks OUT OF FRAME.
MR. HOPKINS: Clean up your act somewhere else!
ON JACOB: We catch him walking down the sidewalk. He tramps along with his hands stuffed in his pockets and his eyes on the pavement. He looks like he hasn't slept in days. The sound of the crowd ahead of him finally grabs his attention. Jacob approaches the disturbance and comes across a young girl standing behind a bush holding a BAG OF GROCERIES. She is KAREN MILLER, dark hair, sixteen, very pretty, but with a faraway look in her eyes. Jacob stands next to her and stares at the crowd like a zombie. She doesn't turn to look at him as he speaks:
JACOB: What's going on?
KAREN: Free speech. The right of assembly.
JACOB: What is this place?
KAREN: It's a home. A foster home. For teenagers. It's where you go when things get bad. It's the place to figure out what to do next. It's a home for kids that no one else wants. It's MY home.
JACOB: He stands there and watches.
MR. HOPKINS: Why can't you find somewhere else to shack up?
KAREN: What have we ever done to you?
MR. HOPKINS: Karen turns quickly away from him and trips over a sprinkler head. Her groceries tumble onto the grass. A hand reaches down to help her. It's Jacob's. He quietly helps her re-bag her groceries as Mr. Hopkins looms above them. Both angry and embarrassed now. Jacob can't take this guy anymore. He stands up and faces the older man with a scowl.
JACOB: Lighten up, mister.
MR. HOPKINS: ( smirks ) And what gutter did you crawl out from, ( frowns ) We don't want your kind here.
JACOB: My kind? What kind is that?
MR. HOPKINS: Drug addicts. Dope pushers. We have stand up and take charge.
JACOB: Swell. I've just got a couple of questions for you.Do you love your Of course I do.
MR. HOPKINS: Of course I do.
JACOB: Are they alive?
MR. HOPKINS: My mother is.
JACOB: What's it like?
KAREN: I can think of a stronger word. Are you Yeah. Thanks. I'm Karen.
JACOB: I can think of a stronger word. Are you Yeah. Thanks. I'm Karen.
KAREN: Yeah. Thanks. I'm Karen.
JACOB: Jacob suddenly gets a little light-headed and has to use a wall to hold himself up. Karen looks concerned.
KAREN: Are YOU okay?
JACOB: Yeah. I just haven't had much to eat Then come help me unpack.
KAREN: Then come help me unpack.
KAREN: I guess the sandwich is alright, huh?
JACOB: It's incredible. Best I've ever had.
KAREN: You're not from around here, are you?
JACOB: No. I've been on the road for a couple of days.
KAREN: Do you need a place to stay?
MARY: So, we have to get it fixed.
DAVID: We don't have the money to get it fixed.
KAREN: What's wrong?
DAVID: Our plumbing has a bad case of hardening of the arteries. Who's your friend?
KAREN: This is Jacob.
JACOB: Jacob Johnson.
DAVID: David Ross. My wife, Mary.
KAREN: They run this house. They're helping me and three other ids get a footing in reality before they kick us out of the nest to make room for the next batch.
DAVID: If there is a next batch. I see the welcome wagon is back. Was there any A little. Jacob came to my rescue.
KAREN: A little. Jacob came to my rescue.
MARY: ( pleasant ) Where you from, Jacob?
JACOB: Springwood? Where's that?
MARY: Springwood? Where's that?
JACOB: Upstate about a hundred miles.
DAVID: ( suspicious ) I know this state like the back of my hand. I've never heard of Springwood. Jacob's a little down on his luck. I told him he could stay here a few days.
KAREN: Jacob's a little down on his luck. I told him he could stay here a few days.
MARY: Are your parents in Springwood?
JACOB: My father died before I was born. My mother, she's dead, too.
DAVID: You have a legal guardian?
JACOB: Been in any state or federal program?
DAVID: Been in any state or federal program?
JACOB: Just for a little while. So he can get his bearings.
KAREN: Just for a little while. So he can get his bearings.
DAVID: Got any ID?
MARY: ( to David ) I think we can help him out, honey. The budget's tight, but we can't turn down someone in need.
DAVID: Okay. You got three, maybe four days to rest up while we try and find a more permanent arrangement for you. But his isn't going to be a free ride. We're part of a community summer work project and eighty percent of the money you make goes to the house. Everybody works - and that includes you. Are you on drugs?
JACOB: Good. If I catch anything stronger then an aspirin on you, you're outta here. No arguments. You got that straight?
DAVID: Good. If I catch anything stronger then an aspirin on you, you're outta here. No arguments. You got that straight?
JACOB: Yes, sir.
DAVID: Okay. Dinner in two hours. Why don't you go meet the rest of the gang.
KAREN: Thanks, David.
MARY: I'll go fix up the spare bed in Wesley's
DAVID: And take a shower, for chrissakes.
KAREN: Hey, guys, I got someone for you to meet. This is Jacob. Jacob, this is Wesley and Welcome to fun central.
JACOB: Welcome to fun central.
WESLEY: Welcome to fun central.
KAREN: He's going to be staying with us for a Oh yeah? How'd you get through the Hey, beautiful. How's it going?
GINA: Oh yeah? How'd you get through the Hey, beautiful. How's it going?
SCOTT: Hey, beautiful. How's it going?
KAREN: Hi, Scott.
SCOTT: Who's Barney Rubble?
KAREN: This is Jacob Johnson. He's a new resident. At least temporarily.
SCOTT: He better not be rooming with me. I value my privacy.
KAREN: No, I believe that honor goes to Wesley.
WESLEY: Good. I could use the company.
SCOTT: So what's your story? Divorce? Custody battle? Your parents just plain They're dead.
JACOB: They're dead.
KAREN: Mellow out, Scott. Give him a chance to settle in.
SCOTT: Just curious.
JACOB: Is he alright?
SCOTT: He'll be fine. He just has a problem with cigarettes.
GINA: His parents used to use them as a sick kind of discipline. That's why he's If you know that, then why do you smoke in front of him?
JACOB: If you know that, then why do you smoke in front of him?
SCOTT: It's not my problem.
JACOB: Just what is YOUR problem, then?
SCOTT: I took care of my problem. That's why I'M here.
KAREN: His dad used to beat him. One day he couldn't take it any more.
JACOB: What happened?
KAREN: He killed him with his father's gun. Everyone here has a fun tale to tell. Isn't that right, Karen?
GINA: Everyone here has a fun tale to tell. Isn't that right, Karen?
KAREN: Yeah. Right.
KAREN: Why don't you go to bed?
JACOB: I can't sleep.
KAREN: You need to talk?
JACOB: No. I'm fine. Thanks.
SCOTT: Come on. Let's hop to it. Gotta make way for those new indoor tennis courts. The fate of the world lies in the balance. Okay, this load's full. You got that?
JACOB: Yeah, no problem.
SCOTT: I don't know. Maybe you should think about switching to de-caf or something.
JACOB: You okay?
GINA: No! Yes! Let go of me! She doesn't like to be touched.
KAREN: She doesn't like to be touched.
JACOB: No shit!
KAREN: Don't take it personally. It's not her What happened to her?
JACOB: What happened to her?
KAREN: Her mother was a hooker. She forced Gina to carry on the tradition. When she was
JACOB: Jacob looks off at Gina with genuine concern. Karen gives him the same expression.
KAREN: You look terrible.
JACOB: ( smiling ) I'm sorry.I just wish you'd tell me what happened to you, that's all.
KAREN: I'm sorry.I just wish you'd tell me what happened to you, that's all.
JACOB: I can't talk about it right now. I'll tell you later. I promise.
KAREN: Okay. Why don't you sit and rest for a bit. The supervisor's not around. You look like you could use it.
JACOB: I think I will.
ON SCOTT: He's watched the entire interchange between Jacob and Karen, and he DOESN'T like it.
WITH JACOB: as he goes around the stack of lumber and sits down facing the brick wall. He lets out a heavy sigh and stares at the inside of the building.
IT EXPLODES: Bricks fly out at us as a gaping hole blows into the wall revealing nothing but BLACKNESS and our shot MOVES through:
VOICE: Hey, you!
SUPERVISOR: No slacking off. Back to work.
JACOB: What! Jesus fucking.Oh, shit!
SUPERVISOR: Whoa! Get a grip, boy.
JACOB: Huh? What's going on?
SUPERVISOR: Nothing. That's the problem. Now that you've gotten your beauty rest, let's see if you can change it, okay?
WESLEY: Aren't you going to bed?
JACOB: I'm not tired.
WESLEY: Bullshit. If you looked any more tired, you'd be dead.
JACOB: That's right.
WESLEY: You gotta sleep, man.
JACOB: Why? Who says? You know, people don't even really know why we sleep. They haven't found any physical reason for it.
WESLEY: But they do know that you go nuts if you Sharks don't sleep. They can't pump water through their gills on their own. They have to always keep moving. If they stop, they can't breath. If they go to sleep, they die.
JACOB: Sharks don't sleep. They can't pump water through their gills on their own. They have to always keep moving. If they stop, they can't breath. If they go to sleep, they die.
WESLEY: You're not a shark.
JACOB: I know. I'm just a kid. Don't worry about me, Wes. Go to sleep.
FREDDY: You can't stay awake forever, boy!
ON JACOB: his eyes are open, his mouth is hanging in a SILENT SCREAM. It looks like his head is about to explode. He lifts his hand up to his face. He's holding an eight-inch long MONSTER
WESLEY: I told you you'd go nuts!
JACOB: Get everybody else. I have to tell them In the middle of the night?
WESLEY: In the middle of the night?
JACOB: I MEAN it!
SCOTT: I don't get it. Is this guy alive or He's neither. He haunts your dreams and if he kills you, you die for real.
JACOB: He's neither. He haunts your dreams and if he kills you, you die for real.
WESLEY: I haven't dreamed of him. I have nightmares like you wouldn't believe, but never of this guy.
SCOTT: That's because this all rates an eleven on the bullshit meter! I don't know why we have to listen to this crap. You're scaring the hell out of Wes here.
GINA: Keep your voice down.
SCOTT: It doesn't matter. The Ross's sleep like rocks, which is what we all should be I know this sounds crazy, but I swear it's true. I went to bed one night and woke up in the middle of the road. Freddy Krueger killed my mother, blasted my whole town into his nightmare, and, worst of all, I think he wants to use me to kill more kids and bring more towns into his world.
JACOB: I know this sounds crazy, but I swear it's true. I went to bed one night and woke up in the middle of the road. Freddy Krueger killed my mother, blasted my whole town into his nightmare, and, worst of all, I think he wants to use me to kill more kids and bring more towns into his world.
KAREN: I'm not sure. I think I'm some kind of carrier. He's somehow inside me and as soon as I fall deep enough into sleep he'll be let loose. You guys were great to take me in. I just don't want to thank you by getting you all killed.
JACOB: I'm not sure. I think I'm some kind of carrier. He's somehow inside me and as soon as I fall deep enough into sleep he'll be let loose. You guys were great to take me in. I just don't want to thank you by getting you all killed.
SCOTT: Okay. Show me Springwood. There's nothing there.
JACOB: That's what I've been trying to tell you.
SCOTT: There's NEVER been a town there.
JACOB: That's how YOU see it. I was part of the nightmare, so I'm the only one who notices the difference.
SCOTT: Look, Jacob. You don't have to convince us that nightmares are real. Everybody in this room has been through one. And some of us are still living it. But the thing is, we know it's just in our heads now. It can be just as bad as the real thing was, but it's still only a memory. It can't hurt us physically, unless we do the hurting ourselves.
GINA: And we don't want to see you get hurt.
WESLEY: We know it gets crazy. And we'll help out the best we can.
SCOTT: But this is just too hard to believe.
JACOB: You don't believe me, either, do you?
KAREN: I don't know.
JACOB: Why are you still here?
KAREN: I'm not sure. I guess, I guess I see a lot of me in you.
JACOB: Feels good to see someone more fucked up than yourself, huh?
KAREN: Yeah. That must be it.
JACOB: But you haven't told me why you're here at this place.
KAREN: I can't talk about it right now. Maybe later. Do you want me to stay with you?
JACOB: Yeah, that'd be great. Don't let me sleep, okay?
KAREN: I'll do my best. Thank God for cable TV.
JACOB: Yeah. Thank God.
KAREN: Where are you going?
JACOB: I'm leaving.
KAREN: He can't hurt you if I'm gone. Maybe I'll go to the desert or something. I'll lie down in the middle of nowhere and finally get some sleep. Krueger can feed of the dreams of snakes and vultures.
JACOB: He can't hurt you if I'm gone. Maybe I'll go to the desert or something. I'll lie down in the middle of nowhere and finally get some sleep. Krueger can feed of the dreams of snakes and vultures.
KAREN: Fine. You're just going to take off
JACOB: Don't do this to me. I'm just trying to protect you and the others.
KAREN: Right. You blow into town and then blow right out. Terrific.
JACOB: I don't understand why you're so mad at You just don't get it, do you?
KAREN: You just don't get it, do you?
JACOB: Get what? Maybe I'm crazy.
KAREN: Running away doesn't help.
JACOB: And you're going to convince me, huh?
KAREN: This time Karen smiles. Jacob looks at her and sighs. Then he yawns.
JACOB: Yeah. Sure.
ALICE: Her body takes shape as she reaches out a pleading arm to us.
ALICE: Jacob! Help me!
FREDDY: Say it, don't spray it, huh, Jacob? Come and join the fun!
NOOOOOOO!: Jacob's voice rips through the scene as everything starts to
KAREN: His body jerks around as if caught in the throes of an epileptic seizure. He SHRIEKS, ignoring Karen completely, and continues to shriek and scream and yell and shake. Like he's never going to stop.
JACOB: His body jerks around as if caught in the throes of an epileptic seizure. He SHRIEKS, ignoring Karen completely, and continues to shriek and scream and yell and shake. Like he's never going to stop.
MR. HOPKINS: I told you! It's an overdose! Jesus Christ, I saw this coming. Call 9-1-1!
JACOB: No! Don't let them take me!
KAREN: Jacob, it'll be alright.
JACOB: You don't understand! Let me go! This is just what we need.
DAVID: This is just what we need.
JACOB: Don't fucking put me under! You'll set him free! He'll kill them all.
FREDDY KRUEGER: Freddy has his hands on his hips and a grin on his face.
FREDDY: Thanks for the lift, kid!
JACOB: What do you want from me?
FREDDY: I already got it! The rest I'm going to get from your new little friends.
JACOB: Leave them alone!
FREDDY: It's my duty to clean up the What have you done with my town?
JACOB: What have you done with my town?
FREDDY: Aw, poor baby's homesick, isn't he? Don't worry. We'll all be one happy family soon. Wanna be the first recruit?
JACOB: Over my dead body!
FREDDY: As you wish. Uh oh. Too many parking tickets. Don't interfere!
BLADE COP: We have to.
SOUND COP: It's our job.
FREDDY: Get a new one. Time to blow this joint. You'll never get me, coppers!
POWER COP: Sound Cop shakes his head. Blade looks frustrated. Jacob steps up behind them.
JACOB: Alright.just who the hell are you guys?
BLADE COP: We're the Dream Police.
JACOB: The what?
POWER COP: The Dream Police. Didn't you hear her, We try and save this guy's ass and then he goes off and cops an attitude. I think you're the wrong guy to talk about attitudes.
SOUND COP: I think you're the wrong guy to talk about attitudes.
BLADE COP: Guys, guys. This is getting us nowhere.
JACOB: Hello? May I butt in here and ask some more stupid questions? We don't know much more than you do. What we do know is that we've been By who?
BLADE COP: We don't know much more than you do. What we do know is that we've been By who?
JACOB: By who?
SOUND COP: We don't know.
JACOB: BLADE COP
BLADE COP: I think that's obvious.
POWER COP: The shit's about to hit the fan.
SOUND COP: Krueger's discovered new powers.
BLADE COP: He's ripped a hole between dreams and Our own powers have been amplified.
POWER COP: Our own powers have been amplified.
SOUND COP: We only hope it will be enough.
BLADE COP: But we're going to need your help.
JACOB: Me? What can I do? Just who are you
BLADE COP: We were like you. We fought Freddy Krueger many years ago. Our souls were released from his grip. No we're back to try again.
JACOB: I still don't understand what. Freddy Krueger can't hurt us anymore.
SOUND COP: Freddy Krueger can't hurt us anymore.
POWER COP: Because we're already dead.
JACOB: What's going on?
DOCTOR: Just relax, everything's fine.
JACOB: That's what you say.
DOCTOR: You're lucky you're here instead of juvenile hall. You put up quite a fight. But you're clean. No traces of drugs or alcohol in your blood.
JACOB: I could've told you that.
DOCTOR: Hold on there.
JACOB: You said I was fine. I have to get back. My friends are in trouble.
DOCTOR: I said you weren't on drugs, but I never said you were fine. You're suffering from extreme fatigue and stress that manifested itself into one hell of an anxiety attack. At least that's what we hope it is. You had a major seizure, You don't understand. This whole town is in danger.
JACOB: You don't understand. This whole town is in danger.
DOCTOR: We're keeping you here for observation. You're not going anywhere tonight.
JACOB: You can't do that. You don't have the Yes we do. Your temporary guardian, Mr. Ross, signed all the papers. If you're okay in the morning we might let you go home. Until then, you're bed bound.
DOCTOR: Yes we do. Your temporary guardian, Mr. Ross, signed all the papers. If you're okay in the morning we might let you go home. Until then, you're bed bound.
JACOB: We took off the restraints. Do you want us to put them back on?
DOCTOR: We took off the restraints. Do you want us to put them back on?
DAVID: He closes the door behind him.
JACOB: and we hear it LOCK
GINA: Nice movie, huh? And I came in here to mellow out. It's all yours.
WESLEY: moves to the couch, clearly mesmerized by the scene. He curls up, absently pulling the white blanket around him as he ON THE TV The orderlies in the movie manage to get the needle into their patient, who MOANS and SOBS pathetically.
WESLEY: vaguely tenses at this and absently pulls the blanket more tightly around him to compensate, like a cocoon.
SECOND ORDERLY: Yeah, mac. You've just had a hard day, that's all.
REVEAL: The carpet at the edge of the room is bunched up as though the walls of the room itself have budged a few inches inward. BACK ON THE TV the second orderly lights his cigarette as he hands the pack to the first. They both look down at the madman as they savor their cigarettes.
SECOND ORDERLY: Yeah, Wesley. Have a smoke.
WESLEY: Fuck this.
FIRST ORDERLY: Relax, Wesley.
WESLEY: The second orderly BOLTS into view. He has become Freddy As they hold their smokes out TOWARD US, their arms PROTRUDE FROM THE TV SET with their lit cigarettes. Wesley SCREAMS and jerks his head away from TV and he HITS the floor with an ugly THUMP. The wind knocked out of him. He rolls. The couch is GONE. As he squirms and struggles to escape his white cocoon, the frightened boy looks around and sees that everything in the room - furniture, carpet, TV, even the door - are all gone, leaving just the white walls SLOWLY CLOSING IN ON HIM. Then we see that on the floor all around Wesley are long, cylindrical white objects. Clearly, they resemble GIANT CIGARETTES, and Wesley - wrapped neck-to-toe in his white blanket cocoon - looks just like one of them. He continues to squirm and SCREAM as the walls CLOSE IN from all sides closer CLOSER pushing the long white things toward him, around him, bunching them together until they are in a tight cluster, as the room CRUNCHES IN TIGHTLY, blocking whatever light source there is, until all Wesley can do is SCREAM one last time, and The screen goes BLACK. After a few beats, we hear a huge, deafening RIPPING SOUND, and a new LIGHT SOURCE appears as Wesley looks up, eyes wide with unspeakable horror as the giant, scarred face of FREDDY looms over him, grinning, and we:
FREDDY: Yeah, Wesley. Everything's gonna be great! Just have a smoke on us!
FREDDY: Didn't Daddy ever tell you what the Surgeon General says.? Smoking's bad for your health! Ah! A match made in heaven!
WESLEY: Go to hell!
FREDDY: And he taps the Wesley-cig with his finger. The ashes immediately fall, sifting in the air as Wesley's head - charred and black at the neck where it's been separated - falls loose. Wesley SCREAMS.
WESLEY: and his severed head falls and falls and falls.
ASSISTANT: I don't get it. The couch is barely scorched. And how can he burn from just the neck down?
CORONER: It happens.
ASSISTANT: It happens? That's your explanation?
CORONER: I've seen worse. What? What worse?
ASSISTANT: What? What worse?
CORONER: Never mind.
ASSISTANT: No. I wanna know. Really. What could be worse than.
FIRE MARSHALL: You know what the gossip rags are going to say? Spontaneous human combustion.
COP: What's that?
FIRE MARSHALL: That's where bodies are supposed to go up in smoke for no reason. It's all psychic bullshit. What really happened is called the candle effect. A tiny fire gets started, usually from a cigarette. It slowly smolders through the blanket and clothes until the skin starts to actually bake. The body fat begins to melt and liquefy, fueling the fire like a slow burning candle. It takes hours, but it's
COP: He fell asleep while smoking. What a
SCOTT: That's impossible.
JACOB: Oh my God. It's started.
KAREN: Oh my God. It's started.
JACOB: Oh my God. It's started.
SCOTT: He fucking burned alive.
KAREN: They said he fell asleep smoking.
SCOTT: And we all know that can't be.
JACOB: I already told you how it would happen.
SCOTT: Don't start with that shit.
JACOB: It's not shit.
DAVID: C'mon, kids. Everyone inside. Now.
DAVID: We have to be strong. We need to pull together and help each other. Mrs. Ross is upstairs in bed. She's pretty messed up. We need to help her deal with this.
SCOTT: He would never touch a cigarette. You know that.
DAVID: We don't know anything until the authorities are finished with their investigation. In the mean time, no work for tomorrow - three day weekend. But Monday, it's back on the job. Jacob wasn't covered in our health plan and his little stint at the hospital cost us a bundle. We have to work together or we might lose this place. Okay?
JACOB: When I was put under, Freddy was released. I know this because I dreamed And that dream was real?
SCOTT: And that dream was real?
JACOB: Yes. Wesley was his first victim.
SCOTT: Aw, man.
JACOB: You said it yourself. How could it have been a cigarette?
KAREN: And how could he.dire that way and not wake up?
GINA: ( mockingly ) Maybe the "authorities" will figure it I'm sorry. I just can't buy into this.
SCOTT: I'm sorry. I just can't buy into this.
JACOB: Call me crazy.but I think he's after Rosedale. The whole place. In my dream he said something about needing a few souls to get the job done. I think he has to kill in order to get the power to suck in a new town.
SCOTT: You are crazy.
JACOB: Thank you. There's more. There are. other people in there. In the Like him?
KAREN: Like him?
JACOB: No. Different. There are three of them. They're dressed in black. They have powers like Freddy, but they seem to be on our side.
KAREN: Who are they?
JACOB: Well, you gotta hang in there with me on this one. They call themselves. the Dream Police.
SCOTT: This is too much.
GINA: You mean.like cops?
JACOB: I guess.
KAREN: Where are they from?
JACOB: They're kids that Freddy killed years ago. THEY don't even know how they got there. But they're somehow patrolling dreamworld to put a stop to Krueger.
SCOTT: Then why haven't these guys done the job They say they need help. I don't know what or why.yet.
JACOB: They say they need help. I don't know what or why.yet.
SCOTT: I can tell you who needs help.
JACOB: Hey, I'm trying to save all of us.
SCOTT: I won't believe it until I see it.
JACOB: By then it'll be too late. It was too late for Wesley.
KAREN: They're going to use all this to shut us I know. It's my fault.
JACOB: I know. It's my fault.
KAREN: You going to try to run away again?
JACOB: It's too late for that. I have to stay and try and put a stop to it.
KAREN: I'm sorry. It's all so hard to accept.
JACOB: I wish I could convince you of the danger you and the others are in.
KAREN: I've been in danger before. THAT I can This is worse than anything you can I wouldn't be so sure about that. Come on. Let's go inside.
JACOB: This is worse than anything you can I wouldn't be so sure about that. Come on. Let's go inside.
KAREN: I wouldn't be so sure about that. Come on. Let's go inside.
KAREN: She was great. Loving. Supportive, caring - everything a mom should be. Except she had one fatal flow: my father. You see, she was raised at a time when they still had the "obey" part in the wedding vows. He was always jealous. She couldn't talk to another man without him thinking she wanted to go to bed with him. He never hit me. But the things he did to her.and she would always just take it. She never fought back. He'd get drunk and.she'd tell people she just fell down or something. Then one night.I was thirteen. Something happened. My mom suddenly wouldn't take it anymore. Something made her say enough is enough. She hit back. Tat only made it worse. I watched as he hit her over and over. Then he knocked her down the stairs. She broke her neck. And when y father saw what he'd done - he finally became human. He cried over her body for a while, then went into the garage and blew his brains out with a shotgun. To this day I don't remember what that final straw was. The shrinks say I've blocked it out of my memory. There's no one else alive who knows what really happened. I have dreams about it sometimes, but there's always that blank spot. A missing piece.
DIFFERENT ANGLE: Jacob opens his eyes and touches Karen's arm. She finally turns to him.
JACOB: I'm sorry.
KAREN: I know nightmares are real, Jacob. I So did my mom. She taught me a lot about Like what?
JACOB: So did my mom. She taught me a lot about Like what?
KAREN: Like what?
JACOB: She told me that a lot of people have special dream powers. I inherited some from her - and some I have all to myself. She showed me how I could link up with other people's dreams - to actually be inside with them.
KAREN: That sounds wonderful. But.I don't A little hard to imagine, huh?
JACOB: A little hard to imagine, huh?
KAREN: Yeah. I'm sorry.
JACOB: I can convince you.
KAREN: Easy. We're doing it now.
JACOB: Easy. We're doing it now.
KAREN: What do you mean?
JACOB: I mean we're dreaming. You and me. Want to go for a walk?
KAREN: I don't believe it.
JACOB: It's true. We're really doing it.
KAREN: But what if I'm just dreaming of you telling me that?
JACOB: We'll compare notes when we wake up. Then you'll know. Karen. Wait.
KAREN: Did you bring us here on purpose? Can you go anywhere you want?
JACOB: Sometimes. It's not as easy as linking up, though.
KAREN: Wow, I never knew. You know what I like to do in my dreams? I like to be other people! I can be anybody I want.
JACOB: Show off.
JACOB: I think I like you the way you always
DIFFERENT ANGLE: And now Karen is herself again. They're still very close. They look like they're about to kiss. but Karen suddenly sees something that grabs her attention.
KAREN: Jacob turns as Karen runs over to ANOTHER DOOR. It's not the one to the bedroom. It just hangs there in space between two She reaches for the knob and opens it.
JACOB: Karen, no!
KAREN: Oh no.
FREDDY: Welcome to Romper Room!
KAREN: Why are you doing this?
FREDDY: Don't you remember?
JACOB: Come on! Wake up!
KAREN: You heard me. I said wake up!
JACOB: You heard me. I said wake up!
KAREN: How? This is my old house. How did I get here? Why are you doing this to me?
JACOB: This is a dream! You have to get out of here. I'm not hurting you, only he can really do that! Wake up now!
FREDDY: Gettin' kinky, huh?
KAREN: I think I get it now.
KAREN: You hit me.
JACOB: Are you hurt?
KAREN: If he had done it, you'd be dead.
JACOB: If he had done it, you'd be dead.
KAREN: You better get back to your room. We don't want anybody to get the wrong idea.
JACOB: ( smirks ) Or the right one?
KAREN: Get out of here.
JACOB: That's something else my mom taught me. Don't sleep.
KAREN: No. Not tonight.
KAREN: I'm telling you, this Freddy guy is for And I'm telling you a dream is a dream.
SCOTT: And I'm telling you a dream is a dream.
KAREN: Jacob was in there with me.
SCOTT: And where else was he with you last What the hell is that supposed to mean?
JACOB: What the hell is that supposed to mean?
KAREN: I have the picture in my room if you want to see it. He brought it out from the Or from your hope chest. I bet your bed isn't the only thing he's been into.
SCOTT: Or from your hope chest. I bet your bed isn't the only thing he's been into.
KAREN: That picture was destroyed years ago.
JACOB: You better watch your mouth, pal.
SCOTT: I'm the last person you want to start fucking with.
JACOB: Go ahead and be a tough guy, Scott. Krueger will cut you to pieces before you can even flex a muscle.
GINA: Will you two stop it! You're scaring the shit out of me.
KAREN: You should be scared.
DAVID: Alright. What's going on here?
SCOTT: Join the fun. Jacob and Karen were just telling us about their new excuse to sleep together.
JACOB: Nothing happened between us last night.
SCOTT: You mean in plain old reality, right?
DAVID: Okay, everybody. Out. Jacob and I are going to have a little talk. Now. Your days are numbered here, buster.
JACOB: I'm sorry, but.
DAVID: Hey, I don't know what kind of shit you're shoveling to these kids, but it's going to stop. My Good Samaritan instincts have their limits. We've had enough tragedy around this place. We don't need you making things worse with You don't understand
JACOB: You don't understand
DAVID: And I want you to stay away from Karen.
JACOB: It's a free country.
DAVID: This isn't America, it's my house. I've been checking up on you. You have no record with the police or the state or any of the runaway groups. You're the invisible kid. And if I sense even a little bit more trouble-making from you, you're going to vanish from here. Got Yes, sir.
JACOB: Yes, sir.
JACOB: You're supposed to be off-limits to me.
KAREN: It's okay. The Ross's have gone to a council meeting and Scott's in his room. We should be safe for awhile.
JACOB: Jacob, what are we going to do?
KAREN: Jacob, what are we going to do?
JACOB: I'm going to go to bed soon.
KAREN: Now you WANT to sleep?
JACOB: I have to find the Dream Police. I think I'm somehow their link to all this. They only seem to appear when I'm around. You woke me up before I had a chance to talk to them last night.
KAREN: I'm sorry. I was scared.
JACOB: your fault. I have to ask them what we're supposed to do to help them. And maybe I can protect Gina while I'm in What about Scott?
KAREN: What about Scott?
JACOB: He's on his own.
KAREN: I don't mean to be cold,but we've done everything to convince him. Gina's too scared to understand. I think Freddy will go after her next.
JACOB: I don't mean to be cold,but we've done everything to convince him. Gina's too scared to understand. I think Freddy will go after her next.
KAREN: What should I do?
JACOB: You have to stay awake.
KAREN: That's not going to be easy. I'm half asleep already.
JACOB: You have to try.
KAREN: I'd better get out of here.
JACOB: Okay. Be careful.
KAREN: YOU be careful. I'm not going anywhere.
FREDDY: Going up? At your service.
GINA: You're not real!
FREDDY: Ah, but who is? Fourth floor. Overpopulation. Eight floor - the morgue. Time to go down, Gina.
FAT MAN: Hi there, princess. Your mom's told me all about you. She said you're even better than she is. Aw, come on. I'm really a nice guy. You know what they say. Inside every fat
FREDDY: .is a maniac trying to get out! Now it's time for YOU to put out, Gina.
FREDDY: Huh? I didn't order anything. Maybe its complimentary champagne!
JACOB: Come on!
GINA: Let go of me! I'm here to help!
JACOB: I'm here to help!
GINA: Let's get out of here.
POWER COP: Where'd he go?
SOUND COP: I thought you had him.
BLADE COP: Krueger has escaped.
HOTEL CORRIDOR: Jacob runs, Gina trailing behind him, the two of them trying to find a way out. They pass a door. The door SLAMS open and Freddy reaches out, grabs Gina and yanks her into the room. The door BANGS shut. Jacob twirls around and runs towards the door. And the door DISAPPEARS. Nothing but flat wall remains as Jacob hits it. He starts banging his fist against the side of the corridor.
JACOB: No no no no! He's got Gina!
SOUND COP: Stand back.
JACOB: You let him get away!
SOUND COP: It's difficult.
POWER COP: He's been at this longer than we have.
BLADE COP: He can do anything.
SOUND COP: But we have to catch him in the act to get him.
JACOB: What.there are rules to all this?
SOUND COP: They're not rules.
POWER COP: It's just the way it is.
BLADE COP: Jacob, we need you to bring the rest The rest? You mean the kids at the home?
JACOB: The rest? You mean the kids at the home?
BLADE COP: Yes. We need as many of you as we can get. And you must bring them to You have the power to link your dreams with other's. Dream of Springwood, then bring the rest with you.
JACOB: BLADE COP
BLADE COP: You have the power to link your dreams with other's. Dream of Springwood, then bring the rest with you.
SOUND COP: Living souls are what he thrives on. Living souls are what we need to help stop him.
POWER COP: Before it's too late.
BLADE COP: Before he takes everyone.
SOUND COP: And every THING.
FREDDY: Ah.alone at last. Touching, isn't it?
JACOB: Jacob jumps out of bed.
KAREN: Is it an earthquake?
JACOB: No. It's Freddy.
DAVID: Pack your bags, kids.
JACOB: You're kicking us out?
DAVID: No. They're taking you away. They say it's for your own good.
KAREN: They can't do that.
DAVID: Yes, they can. They consider Mary and I possibly unfit to act as foster parents. They're going to find temporary homes for you until this mess is straightened out. I'm so very sorry. No, please.
KAREN: No, please.
DAVID: They're not calling it an accident this time. They don't really know what to call it.
SCOTT: What's going to happen to us?
DAVID: You'll be alright.
KAREN: What's going to happen to you?
DAVID: I don't know. They're thinking of pressing charges.
JACOB: Aw, Jesus.
DAVID: Come on. A car from juvenile hall will be here in an hour.
MR. SILVERMAN: I'm sure most of you know how this works already. You'll be assigned new foster homes tomorrow afternoon. Tomorrow morning the police will be talking to you regarding the matter at the old house.
KAREN: What about it?
MR. SILVERMAN: Anything you know.
SCOTT: Are we considered suspects?
MR. SILVERMAN: You'll talk to the police about that. Don't worry. We'll all try and work this Will we be able to go back to the Ross's?
KAREN: Will we be able to go back to the Ross's?
MR. SILVERMAN: I don't know. You'll have a place to stay in the mean time.
KAREN: Will we be together?
MR. SILVERMAN: No. We don't have anybody willing to take more than one person. I'm afraid you'll be split up.
SCOTT: MR. SILVERMAN
MR. SILVERMAN: Hey, you can visit each other. You'll be in the same town.
JACOB: If it's still here.
KAREN: Jacob, what are we going to do?
JACOB: What do you mean, nothing?
KAREN: What do you mean, nothing?
JACOB: It's over. We're finished. He's won.
SCOTT: Looks like your hero just gave up.
KAREN: How can you do this?
JACOB: Do what? I'm not doing anything.
KAREN: Exactly. After all we've been through you just throw in the towel. Why?
JACOB: Because we're fucked. The last thing the Dream Police told me was that they needed all our help. Together. Even if we weren't about to be split up there aren't enough of us left to make a difference.
KAREN: How do you know that?
JACOB: I don't. But, it's all just too much. I've tried so hard and nothing's worked. I'm spent. I'm wasted. I'm.I'm so I've had enough.
KAREN: So you're just going to give up? I'll bet that's something your mother never taught you. We still have one night together.
JACOB: And we're not going to waste it.
KAREN: Scott, we need you.
SCOTT: Look, I don't know what's going on anymore. Two of my friends die and now you tell me I have to drop into dreamland with you guys to do battle with the dude that did it.
JACOB: We'll have help.
SCOTT: Ah, yes. I almost forgot. The Sleepy Squad. Alright. I'll make you a deal. I told you I wouldn't believe this stuff unless I saw it. If I understand this correctly, all I have to do is fall asleep and you just whisk me into the Okay. If that happens, if both of you show up in my dream, I'll help you out. If nothing happens, then I'll get a good night's sleep and laugh at you in the Fine. You got a deal. And you won't be I'm going to be sleeping in the girl's dorm. Will you be able to bring me in?
JACOB: Okay. If that happens, if both of you show up in my dream, I'll help you out. If nothing happens, then I'll get a good night's sleep and laugh at you in the Fine. You got a deal. And you won't be I'm going to be sleeping in the girl's dorm. Will you be able to bring me in?
SCOTT: Okay. If that happens, if both of you show up in my dream, I'll help you out. If nothing happens, then I'll get a good night's sleep and laugh at you in the Fine. You got a deal. And you won't be I'm going to be sleeping in the girl's dorm. Will you be able to bring me in?
JACOB: Fine. You got a deal. And you won't be I'm going to be sleeping in the girl's dorm. Will you be able to bring me in?
KAREN: I'm going to be sleeping in the girl's dorm. Will you be able to bring me in?
JACOB: I hope so. Then I got to make sure we all end up in Springwood.
SCOTT: The old stomping ground?
JACOB: Yeah. Only right now it's not a very pretty place.
KAREN: What do we do when we get there?
JACOB: Play it by ear. And try and stay alive.
SOCIAL WORKER: Half hour til lights out, everyone.
JACOB: Off we go.
SCOTT: Into the wild black yonder.
ON SCOTT: He's still awake. Maybe he's starting to believe some of Jacob's ramblings, because he nervously fidgets in bed.
SCOTT: Freddy Krueger. Yeah, right. Years ago some sicko gets fried and now he comes back to stick it to you when you're snoozing. Stupid bedtime story. Hey, Mr. Creepoid, you still up? Yo, Jacob?
SCOTT: Oh, this is lovely.
BUM: Hey, buddy?
SCOTT: Yeah, what?
BUM: Can you spare some change?
SCOTT: Um, well, let me see. Holy Jesus Christ. I'll catch you next time, buddy.
KAREN: Scott! You're here.
SCOTT: Yeah. Fun town. Talk to any of the neighbors, yet? They're a swell bunch of Uh-huh. Real friendly, too.
KAREN: Uh-huh. Real friendly, too.
SCOTT: So this is a dream?
KAREN: And I'm in it with you. Convinced?
SCOTT: Maybe I'm just dreaming bout being here with you. Wouldn't be the first time.
KAREN: Nope. I tired that one already. Doesn't work. Come on, we have to find Jacob.
KAREN: Jacob! Thank God!
SCOTT: So this is the place, huh?
JACOB: I'm home.
KAREN: What now?
JACOB: Scott, are you with us?
SCOTT: A deal's a deal.
JACOB: Then we wait.
SCOTT: The threesomes stand face-to-face in two parallel rows.
POWER COP: Is this all?
JACOB: All that's left.
SOUND COP: It'll have to do.
SCOTT: We can always come back later. Like when it's daytime.
POWER COP: It's always night here.
JACOB: What's the plan?
BLADE COP: We need you to draw him out.
SCOTT: Terrific. We're supposed to be bait.
SOUND COP: Then let's do it.
JACOB: Then let's do it.
BLADE COP: Fan out.
JACOB: Oh no.
MUTANT BOUNCER: Two drink minimum.
SCOTT: Ah, that's okay. I think I'm underage, Two drink minimum.
MUTANT BOUNCER: Two drink minimum.
SCOTT: No, really. I'm driving.
MUTANT BOUNCER: Two drink minimum.
MUTANT WAITRESS: Can I get you anything?
SCOTT: That's okay. I'll just sit at the bar.
MUTANT WAITRESS: Alright, honey. You call if you need You bet. You'll be the first to know.
SCOTT: You bet. You'll be the first to know.
BARTENDER: What'll it be?
SCOTT: Um, a beer, I guess.
BARTENDER: Go on. Puts hair on your back.
SCOTT: And that's all? That's okay, this'll be plenty.
BARTENDER: No charge. Compliments of the man at the end of the bar.
SCOTT'S POV: The crowd blocks his view, but we can see a gloved hand with four blades strapped to it tapping nonchalantly on the surface of the wood.
FREDDY: Welcome to my favorite haunt.
SCOTT: So you're the man.
FREDDY: At your service.
SCOTT: What's on your mind?
FREDDY: A deal.
SCOTT: A deal's what got me into this.
FREDDY: Bring Jacob to me.
SCOTT: What's in it for me?
FREDDY: Power. You don't need to hang out with those losers. You're a take-charge kind of guy, Scott. Like when you took charge of your father.
SCOTT: Leave my father out of this.
FREDDY: I'll make you mayor of Rosedale.
SCOTT: After you make it look like this?
FREDDY: You can have Karen.
SCOTT: Any way you want her.
FREDDY: Any way you want her.
SCOTT: ( after a beat )
FREDDY: Krueger holds out his knives. Scott shakes his head.
SCOTT: No thanks. I trust you.
JACOB: He turns on the light and a RED HAZE blankets the room. Jacob looks up. The dish-like ceiling lamp is filled with Jacob walks into the room, tears welling. He walks by Alice's vanity, her makeup still sitting there as if she might show up and use it at any moment. He steps up to a wardrobe closet and touches the edges of it lightly. He reaches out and slowly, almost reverently, opens the doors. Dozens of writhing SNAKES drop out of the closet and slither onto the ground. Jacob jumps back and SCREAMS. Then he just stands there in the middle of the teaming reptile mass, not giving a shit anymore, going insane. His fists clenched, his head tilted back, as he YELLS into the air like a wolf baying at the moon.
SCOTT: Mayor of Rosedale. What a crock of shit. Hey! He's over here. Yo! Dream Police. Hello! Come on. Move you collective Never a cop around when you need one.
FREDDY: I hate a snitch!
SCOTT: Eat shit.
JACOB: Jacob races for the front door.
FREDDY: Lighten up, bone brain.
MUTANT BOUNCER: Take it outside!
FREDDY: No more playing around.
SOUND COP: Too late. BAM! Freddy's fist slams down on Power Cop's head. He's actually shoved down into the ground a full two feet - trapped at the legs. BAM! Freddy hits him again. Power Cop is down to his thighs and he can't get out. A RUMBLING is heard. Freddy turns to see Sound Cop starting to open his mouth. Krueger instantly reaches down and grabs a brick from the rubble and THROWS it at Sound Cop.
FREDDY: Put a lid on it!
JACOB: I'm sorry, Scott. Okay, I'm impressed
BLADE COP: You shouldn't be. This is what we were afraid of.
SOUND COP: He still exists.
JACOB: What! How?
POWER COP: We're already dead, that's why he couldn't destroy us.
BLADE COP: But he's not dead. He's not alive either. He's something in between.
SOUND COP: He's not entirely part of reality or part of dreams. He's unique.
BLADE COP: WE can't kill him.
POWER COP: We can wail away on each other until doomsday and not do any good.
JACOB: Then who's going to kill this fucker?
SOUND COP: YOU have to.
JACOB: How the hell am I supposed to do that?
BLADE COP: Krueger's power comes from his rage and the souls of children.
POWER COP: You have to find the original source of that rage and use it against him.
BLADE COP: This town in its present condition encompasses all evils from all times in its history. The answer is here
JACOB: I think I know where.
BLADE COP: Jacob, wait. We have to find him first.
JACOB: No time. You guys find Karen!
KAREN: No more.
KAREN: Jacob! You scared the shit out of me!
JACOB: The feeling is mutual.
KAREN: Where are the Dream Police?
JACOB: I told them to look for you. What are you doing here? Don't you know what this place is?
KAREN: I do now. Look what I found.
JACOB: You've got to get out of here.
KAREN: Wait. You have to see this.
JACOB: You don't understand. The Police can't kill Freddy. They literally chopped each other to pieces and he's still alive! Now I'm supposed to figure out how to get rid of him.
KAREN: But I think I found the answer. Shut up for a second and look at these.
JACOB: Okay, so he's a bad artist.
KAREN: No! You told me Krueger's mother committed suicide and no one knows who his father was, right?
JACOB: Freddy's been pushing all our buttons with our pasts. These are HIS past. Don't you get it? HE was a foster child, Someone had to have taken care of him. This guy.he was Freddy's father. Those drawings.they were Freddy's childhood. This house.it's where it all happened.
KAREN: Freddy's been pushing all our buttons with our pasts. These are HIS past. Don't you get it? HE was a foster child, Someone had to have taken care of him. This guy.he was Freddy's father. Those drawings.they were Freddy's childhood. This house.it's where it all happened.
JACOB: But in reality Freddy hasn't lived here for decades.
KAREN: Like you tried to tell me once before, this is a dream. Who knows why this is all here.
JACOB: All evils from all times in history.
KAREN: And isn't this where it all started in Springwood? On Elm Street?
JACOB: But what does this do for us?
KAREN: There's got to be a way to use it against Okay, but we're not going to stand around here to figure out how. It's too Let's get out of this house.
JACOB: Okay, but we're not going to stand around here to figure out how. It's too Let's get out of this house.
UPSTAIRS HALLWAY: And Blade Cop is standing in the middle of the corridor. The two teenagers stop. KACHINK! A knife shoots out of Blade's right hand, ready for action. ( but wait a minute, her uniform isn't ripped anymore. ) Karen and Jacob make their way to the stairs. He turns to Blade. Blade walks up to him and stands there. Then JAMS HER KNIFE into JACOB'S GUT. Karen SCREAMS. Jacob chokes. Blade Cop shoves the knife in further until it juts out of Jacob's back. She turns. Then BECOMES FREDDY.
FREDDY: Time to join your mommy.
KAREN: No no no no no no no.Jacob.
FREDDY: Young love.ha!
JACOB: And Jacob is gone. Karen sobs, so torn apart that she is ignoring the incredible danger above her. But not for long. Krueger grabs Karen by the neck.
FREDDY: It's past your bedtime, young lady.
MASTER BEDROOM: Freddy drags Karen in and TOSSES her across the room. She lands with a THUD on the bed. He saunters over to her and climbs up on the bed next to her. Gets on top. Karen yells and hits him uselessly with her fists and it's horrible because there he is, pressing down on her, right in her face, mounting her as if he's going to rape her. She screams as he presses even harder. And the last three words of that sentence seem to ECHO through the room, swirling around Karen. DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL. "Daddy's little girl." Karen twists her head away. And Freddy's become Karen's FATHER. He looks down on her with a lecherous grin.
KAREN'S FATHER: That's my baby. That's Daddy's little
KAREN: Oh no.
KAREN'S FATHER: ( Freddy's voice ) Now do you remember?
KAREN: You're NOT my father.
KAREN'S FATHER: But we're going to have the same fun!
KAREN'S MOTHER: That's enough!
KAREN: Mommy, no!
KAREN'S MOTHER: You're never going to touch her again!
KAREN'S FATHER: I'll touch what I want!
WITH KAREN: as she hits the ground and the wall next to Jacob's body. She looks up.
WIDER: And Karen's Father is now FREDDY again. He swings his fist.
SMACK!: Karen's Mother reels from the hit, falls backwards. Karen jumps up to try and help her, reaching past Freddy. But it's too late. Karen's Mother tumbles down the stairs, head hitting, bones cracking, disappearing into darkness. Freddy grabs Karen by the neck and lifts her. DANGLES her over the top of the steps.
FREDDY: Be honored, bitch. You're the last soul I need.
JACOB: I'll be back.
FREDDY: I'll be waiting. Where's my little pumpkin?
DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY: Freddy walks down and no one's there. Karen's Mom was just an illusion, but Karen herself, dead or alive, is nowhere to be seen. He walks down the hallway. Eyes darting. Until a BOOMING VOICE is heard from the kitchen.
VOICE: Freddy cocks his head and frowns. And, amazingly, a look of FEAR crosses Krueger's face. Something about that voice has struck terror in the heart of the creature that fears nobody. Krueger turns to the kitchen door. A man steps out of the shadows, a big muscular man with a horrifying look in his eyes. A man we've seen somewhere before - in a picture. It's FREDDY'S FOSTER FATHER - MR. UNDERWOOD. And he looks pissed beyond belief. Freddy shrinks back, eyes widening.

FREDDY: MR. UNDERWOOD
MR. UNDERWOOD: Don't you "Daddy" me!
FREDDY: No, Daddy. Please.
MR. UNDERWOOD: You took some things that don't belong to
POWER COP: We gotta get outta here!
BLADE COP: It took a human touch. It took knowing HIS nightmare. Goodbye, Karen.
KAREN'S POV: It's an ID bracelet. A band of gold with a larger plate dangling from the middle of it. Karen's hand turns it over. This time the printing reads JACOB.
WITH KAREN: she chokes back the tears. We hear a PANTING O.S. Then a woman's voice.
WOMAN: You okay, honey?
KAREN: Yes. I'm alright.
WOMAN: I've never seen you around. Are you new in town?
KAREN: Sort of.
WOMAN: Well then. Welcome to Springwood.
