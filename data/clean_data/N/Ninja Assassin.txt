NINJA ASSASSIN: Written by
HOLLYWOOD: Fuck! Fucking-shit-fuck-fucking-
HOLLYWOOD: Watch it, old man!
TATTOO ARTIST: The needle is doing what the needle does.
HOLLYWOOD: What's that supposed to mean?
TATTOO MASTER: The irezumi does not hide the skin, the tattoo reveals the nature of the man and illuminates the four noble professions in the Book of Five Rings: the Warrior, the Artist, the Merchant, and the farmer. If there is a conflict between the needle and the skin, between the mark and the man, then perhaps the path you have chosen is not the path for which you are What did you just say, old man?
HOLLYWOOD: What did you just say, old man?
TATTOO MASTER: No disrespect.
HOLLYWOOD: You're lucky. I can't kill you 'til you finish this thing. Gimme that mirror! How's it looking?
YAKUZA ONE: Hey, boss. This just came for you.
HOLLYWOOD: What is it?
YAKUZA ONE: A letter.
HOLLYWOOD: So open it, dumb ass.
YAKUZA ONE: Looks like sand.
TATTOO MASTER: You know what this is?
HOLLYWOOD: You know what this is?
TATTOO MASTER: Years ago, I watched a man open an envelope like that one.
HOLLYWOOD: What came out of the shadows?
TATTOO MASTER: I cannot say the word.
HOLLYWOOD: What word?
TATTOO ARTIST: That night, one of their blades struck here. I should have died, but for an accident of birth. My heart is here, on the other side.
HOLLYWOOD: What the fuck is that?
YAKUZA ONE: Looks like a Ninja, boss.
HOLLYWOOD: A ninja? Are you kidding me? That's the word you're afraid to say? Ninja?
TATTOO ARTIST: But you are real, aren't you?
CHECKER: That's a lot of noodles. Are you a student? Tourist? Here on business?
RAIZO: I don't think so. Sorry.
CHECKER: So if you're not a student, and you're not a tourist, and you're not here to work. what are you For what?
RAIZO: For what?
CHECKER: For what?
RAIZO: For the wheel to turn.
OZUNU: .you must never, ever forget who you are, how you came to be. You are Ozunu. You are a part of me as I am a part of you.
MASLOW: What's all this for the Delgata No. This is Delgata-
MIKA: No. This is Delgata-
MASLOW: And the rest?
MIKA: Her eyes tell him.
MASLOW: Her eyes tell him.
MIKA: You said you'd take it serious when I had serious evidence.
MASLOW: Does that evidence include photos of the Loch Ness monster as well?
MIKA: You've trusted my research before, what's the problem now Ryan?
MASLOW: What's the problem? Come on Mika, it's like one of those questions on an IQ test, which of these doesn't belong; laptops, space shuttles, nanotechnology, ninjas.
MIKA: All I'm asking for is an hour. That's all. Give me an hour and if you still think I'm chasing UFO's, I'll walk out and you'll never hear another thing about
MASLOW: Why do I think I'm going to regret
RAIZO: Is everything all right?
LANDLADY: Yes, fine, it's all fixed. You keep it very dark and spare in Ms. Ali, my privacy is very important to me. If you enter my apartment again without my permission, I will leave your I just
RAIZO: Ms. Ali, my privacy is very important to me. If you enter my apartment again without my permission, I will leave your I just
LANDLADY: I just
RAIZO: Good day.
OZUNU: On the street. Abandoned by your parents. Without a home. Without people to care for you. You should have done as most children do, and gone quietly from this world, to the next. But, instead you fought. As you did here today. You fought. And you won.
MIKA: Some people see money as the root of all evil, but to me it looks like a fingerprint. Whether we're talking about 19th century Korea, or 21st century Iraq, the game is the same. If you want to understand why certain things are happening, you have to understand the flow of money.
MASLOW: You're excited, Mika. You know I get nervous when you're excited.
MIKA: You remember the Eulmi incident?
MASLOW: Korean queen, late eighteen- hundred's. According to you, she was off'd by one of these ninja Ozunu. I think. I've been going through some of the original transcripts of the trial of Kunitomo Shigeaki. The prosecutor questioned him about a payment of 100 pounds of gold. Shigeaki answered that he didn't know what the prosecutor was talking about. The question was never brought up again. But what pinged for me was the amount- the exact same amount rumored to be paid to the Hattori Clan for the assassination of Lord So you start to wonder, in this ever changing world, if the cost of a man's life has remained Exactly. I figure these clans are like a thousand years old. They probably don't change a lot.

MIKA: Exactly. I figure these clans are like a thousand years old. They probably don't change a lot.
MASLOW: Highly circumstantial.
MIKA: I thought you might say that so I checked how often this particular bank transferred that market equivalent to a hundred pounds of gold in the last three years.
MASLOW: Let me guess.
MIKA: Not once.
MASLOW: Okay you got me. This is The clans are real, Ryan. They steal children and turn them into assassins. They've been doing it for years and nobody's doing a damn thing to stop them.
MIKA: The clans are real, Ryan. They steal children and turn them into assassins. They've been doing it for years and nobody's doing a damn thing to stop them.
MASLOW: Look, no one's denying the historical record, Mika. But the whole idea just doesn't fit in with a modern world. It's like one of those questions on an IQ test: which of these doesn't belong in this sentence: laptops, space shuttles, nanotechnology, They're real Ryan. You can call them spooks, or assassins, or whatever you want if it makes you feel better, but they're out there. They're killing people and nobody is doing a damn thing to stop them.
MIKA: They're real Ryan. You can call them spooks, or assassins, or whatever you want if it makes you feel better, but they're out there. They're killing people and nobody is doing a damn thing to stop them.
OZUNU: Our enemies are everywhere.
OZUNU: You must move without trace or
PRETTY WOMAN: Hi. excuse me.? Would you mind?
RAIZO: She hands him one end of a freshly dried sheet.
PRETTY WOMAN: If it's not too much trouble, could you help me with this?
RAIZO: What clan are you from?
PRETTY WOMAN: I. don't understand.
RAIZO: You came alone. The Ozunu clan would never make such a mistake.
MANAGER: What is going on-
MASLOW: And two cokes, please.
MIKA: How long have you been here? And you can't say "zwei cola bitte"?
MASLOW: Course I can, but you tend to hear more interesting things if people don't know you can understand what they're saying.
MIKA: Do you ever stop being a cop?
MASLOW: Not the way I was raised. My dad always said, being a cop has nothing to do with a clock. It's a consequence of consciousness often interpreted as desire.
MIKA: For justice. And doughnuts.
MASLOW: For justice. And doughnuts.
MIKA: I think so. Same template as before. The transfer was made the day before a multiple homicide in Osaka. The police and newspapers are calling it a gangland slaying.
MASLOW: How do you know what the police report says? You're not still requisitioning evidence with my clearance codes, are you?
MIKA: What about the bank audit?
MASLOW: Denied. It was a long shot at But you said you found something.
MIKA: But you said you found something.
MASLOW: A report. A friend of mine in Moscow, tipped me to it.
MIKA: What happened to him?
MASLOW: Same thing that's going to happen to me, if I keep hanging around with you- booted out of the service for mental instability.
MIKA: Is he still alive? We need to find him.
MASLOW: Working on it.
MIKA: You believe it now, don't you?
MASLOW: Ninjas? Are you kidding?
MIKA: Then why are you doing this?
MASLOW: No idea-
OZUNU: Hunger and thirst, your bowels and breath, even the blood in your veins, are the body's weaknesses.
OZUNU: The world feeds on the weak.
OZUNU: Suffering exists only because weakness exists.
MIKA: .who are you?
OZUNU: Hone your body. Sharpen your mind. Become the weapon you will need to
RAIZO: You shouldn't do that. It's against the rules. If they catch Then they catch me.
KIRIKO: Then they catch me.
RAIZO: They'll put you in the box.
KIRIKO: Yes, they will.
RAIZO: Trees don't have hearts.
KIRIKO: Everything has a heart.
RAIZO: I don't.
KIRIKO: Really? Let me see.
RAIZO: Listen to mine, I'm not lying. I'll prove it.
KIRIKO: Listen to mine, I'm not lying. I'll prove it.
MIKA: Excuse me? Excuse me?
ASIAN MAN: Ahh, Jona. Jona sick.
MIKA: Oh. Well, tell him I hope he feels better
ASIAN MAN: Take care. You should take care.
MIKA: ASIAN MAN
ASIAN MAN: Work so late. Not good for you.
MIKA: 25 EXT. BERLIN STREET - NIGHT. 25
MIKA: .is someone there?
OZUNU: Did Takeshi's blow hurt you? You think this is pain? You are
MASLOW: Last night I'm working late and I get a visit. Guy named Zabranski. Works upstairs for Internal Affairs. Just drops by. In the neighborhood- cup a sugar- how ya doin- kinda thing. Asks what I'm working on. Oh, this and that, usual blibbity blab, I tell him. Then he smiles and says-
ZABRANSKI: .Very Good.
MASLOW: I don't understand what is really going on, but I'm smart enough to recognize a warning when I see But why?
MIKA: But why?
MASLOW: Why? It's obvious. If your little fantasy has even slightest chance of being real, then these Nine Clans would have some pretty major juice protecting them.
MIKA: What are you going to do?
MASLOW: We are going to tip-toe, very carefully from here on out. You understand? You don't do anything else without checking with me. Got
MIKA: Did you find Sabatin yet?
MASLOW: Yeah.he's dead.
MIKA: Heart attack.
MASLOW: Heart attack.
MIKA: They killed him.
MASLOW: People die of heart attacks, Mika.
MIKA: Was he married? Did he have a God, you are relentless, aren't I know you Ryan, you would have A wife.
MASLOW: God, you are relentless, aren't I know you Ryan, you would have A wife.
MIKA: I know you Ryan, you would have A wife.
MASLOW: A wife.
MIKA: Still in Russia?
MASLOW: He pulls a folded piece of paper from his jacket.
MIKA: He pulls a folded piece of paper from his jacket.
MASLOW: Explain something to me first. Where is this obsession coming from? What started this whole
MIKA: Like your father said.It's a consequence of consciousness often interpreted as desire.
MASLOW: Desire for what?
MIKA: For the truth.
MASLOW: Mika! Tip-toe!
MR. OZUNU: For an entire year, you shall live without one of your senses, beginning with the sense you rely on the most: your sight.
OZUNU: A true Shinobi lives in darkness. The night is his weapon.
MIKA: Mrs. Sabatin?
MRS. SABATIN: I'm with Europol. We spoke on the
MIKA: I'm with Europol. We spoke on the
MRS. SABATIN: ( stepping aside )
MIKA: Mika enters.
MRS. SABATIN: You said you read my husband's report, yes? What did you think?
MIKA: I found it.illuminating. Especially the references to the Rihla. Your husband quotes passages not found in Battuta's present manuscript.
MRS. SABATIN: My husband journeyed all over the world researching that report, but when he was home, he never spoke about it. He said it was safer that way.
MIKA: I understand the report caused some problems for him inside the
MRS. SABATIN: The report caused "problems" for Alexei's career the way Moses caused problems for the Pharaoh, you see? Very unpleasant. Terrible people saying terrible
MIKA: What happened?
MRS. SABATIN: About two years ago.two? Yes, after the assassination of Zhukov, the report drew attention. After that, everything was different.
MRS. SABATIN: I will tell you a true thing, and a hard thing. My husband was a soldier. A member of Russian intelligence. He had seen many terrible things.. He was not a man to frighten
MIKA: Do you know what they talked No. Alexei never spoke about it. But two months later, he was dead.
MRS. SABATIN: No. Alexei never spoke about it. But two months later, he was dead.
MIKA: Can I ask how he died?
MRS. SABATIN: The lights went out.
MIKA: What're you
MASLOW: I told you to stop using my confirmation code.
MIKA: I did
MASLOW: Dammit, Mika
MIKA: .I'm sorry, it was the only way I could get the evidence.
MASLOW: What happened?
MIKA: What happened?
MASLOW: What happened? Everything's fucking happened.
MIKA: ( quietly ) DNP.
MASLOW: That's right. DNP. DO NOT
FUCKING PURSUE!: ( quietly )
MIKA: ( quietly )
MASLOW: Right now there are people from internal affairs, CIA, Homeland Security and for all I know the Martian Fucking Military in my office tearing the place apart.
MIKA: Most of this is from Sabatin. Copies of what I think are the lost chapters of the Rihle. I think it describes the original location of the Ozunu Clan but my 14th century Arabic is a little And this?
MASLOW: And this?
MIKA: That's how it started. I made a mistake, mixed up the case code and they sent me that.
MASLOW: Yeah. I know. I don't understand why they're fighting though. It could be a clan war.
MIKA: Yeah. I know. I don't understand why they're fighting though. It could be a clan war.
MASLOW: So you requisitioned this by accident. You used my code which is why you didn't want to show me this. Which is also why they're tearing apart my office right now.
MIKA: I'm sorry Ryan. You have to know I didn't mean for you to get in
MASLOW: Okay, that's low.
MIKA: Look, I know I broke the rules. I'll explain what I did and accept the consequences.
MASLOW: Very noble of you but I've got the feeling this isn't a slap-on-the wrist kinda consequence. Let me take this and try to make some sense of this shitstorm you started. In the meantime, you will not say anything to anybody.
PASSPORT OFFICIAL: Are you coming to Berlin for business or pleasure Mr. Han
RAIZO: 47 INT. MIKA'S OFFICE - DAY 47
ZABRANSKI: Boy you're like a dog with a bone on that computer aren't you?
MIKA: Excuse me? Who are you?
ZABRANSKI: Agent Zabranski. Internal affairs. Need to ask you a couple of questions. You are Mika Coretti, yeah?
MIKA: .A few cases.
ZABRANSKI: You have something of a social You had lunch with him on the 13th and again on the 18th.
MIKA: You had lunch with him on the 13th and again on the 18th.
ZABRANSKI: You had lunch with him on the 13th and again on the 18th.
MIKA: How do you know that?
ZABRANSKI: Is it not true?
MIKA: I.I'm not sure. We do have lunch together sometimes, usually when we're working-
ZABRANSKI: Are you working on something with him right now?
MIKA: No.not right now.
ZABRANSKI: Has Agent Maslow seemed different lately, in any way? Has he done or said anything that struck you as unusual?
MIKA: No why. Has Agent Maslow done
ZABRANSKI: Just routine. The agency cares about its field operatives. We monitor for signs of stress, fatigue, mental exhaustion. Agent Maslow has a serious case load. That much work can wear on a man.
MIKA: Come on.you're kidding me.
MASLOW: Ssssshhhhhh. Sorry, Mika.
MIKA: Fucking Christ, Ryan-
MASLOW: I couldn't talk earlier. They're watching me.
MIKA: Zabranski came to my office. Asking about you.
MASLOW: I know how Sabatin must have felt.
MIKA: What happened?
MASLOW: I showed Jamison the materials.
MIKA: What did he say?
JAMISON: This agency is subject to the International laws and agreements that govern the jurisdiction of our authority. If a case is marked DNP we must respect the jurisprudence of the regional government and act accordingly.
MASLOW: I understand that sir but-
JAMISON: Let me be clear, Agent Maslow. In the eyes of the law these materials do not exist. If so, than there is no case and if there is no case there is no reason for this conversation to continue.
MIKA: He took the materials?
MASLOW: Come on Mika, how could he take something that didn't exist? He couldn't. Which means that I couldn't copy it either, and if I couldn't copy it than I can't be violating international laws and agreements by still having it.
MIKA: What are we going to do?
MASLOW: Your going to go home. Pack your bags and go on holiday.
MIKA: No way-
MASLOW: Don't fucking argue with me, Mika. I trusted you. Now you've got to trust me.
MIKA: Ryan, I can't let you lose your job because of me-
MASLOW: I'm not talking about my job,
MIKA: I've never even fired one of ( pointing ) This is the bad end. This is the end you hold. Point, shoot, run like hell.
MASLOW: ( pointing ) This is the bad end. This is the end you hold. Point, shoot, run like hell.
MIKA: I know. It's unbelievable. I've investigated, world bank officials, drug cartels, arms dealers, and I've never faced this kind of heat. For ninjas. Fucking
MASLOW: I know. It's unbelievable. I've investigated, world bank officials, drug cartels, arms dealers, and I've never faced this kind of heat. For ninjas. Fucking
MIKA: What happened?
NEIGHBOR: What happened?
MIKA: What happened?
NEIGHBOR: Power's out. Us, the building behind us, that one across the street. Seems like every few months, boom, the lights out. I call, I complain, they listen.nothing gets done. So I sit out here, at least it's cool.
MIKA: You're not the first person to give me that advice today..
RAIZO: You know me?
MIKA: .security camera in New York. Recorded you fighting.one of
RAIZO: You know about them?
MIKA: A little.
RAIZO: Okay. Nine. Nine clans. And they apparently have been supplying assassins to governments or anyone who happens to have one hundred pounds of gold lying around for the last thousand years. Give or take.
MIKA: Okay. Nine. Nine clans. And they apparently have been supplying assassins to governments or anyone who happens to have one hundred pounds of gold lying around for the last thousand years. Give or take.
RAIZO: His name was Jin.
MIKA: You knew him?
RAIZO: He was not born an "Assassin".
MIKA: .you're from his clan ?
RAIZO: The clans have three kinds of people! People with power. People with money. Or people hunting them.
MIKA: The Hanta-Kirra.
RAIZO: The Hanta-Kirra.
MIKA: Does that mean what I think it They won't stop until you are Oh god.
RAIZO: They won't stop until you are Oh god.
MIKA: Oh god.
RAIZO: The gun won't help you.
MIKA: I don't have a lot of options okay. I once took a Tae Bo class, but that's the extent of my Kung Fu abilities.
RAIZO: I can help but you must tell me something first.
MIKA: You saw Ms. Sabatin.
RAIZO: You saw Ms. Sabatin.
MIKA: How did you know that?
RAIZO: I've been watching you, waiting for them.
MIKA: But I can get them.
RAIZO: We need something black. Hurry!
TAKESHI: Another Ninja leans forward and tastes the air with his nose. Eyes closed. Like a dog getting the scent, his inhalation a long, low whisper in the silent room.
DOG NINJA: He's taken the girl.
OZUNU: Betrayal begets blood.
OZUNU: This is the law of the Nine Clans. This is the way of the ninja.
MIKA: I'm going to have to make a phone call in order to get the Not now. Just drive.
RAIZO: Not now. Just drive.
MIKA: Does not matter. Just get as far away from here as fast as you can without drawing attention.
RAIZO: Does not matter. Just get as far away from here as fast as you can without drawing attention.
MIKA: You think they're following us?
RAIZO: I know they're following us.
MIKA: I don't see anything back there.
RAIZO: They have our scent.
MIKA: Following our scent? Like dogs?
RAIZO: No. Like Wolves.
MIKA: How do you know so much about I was one of them.
RAIZO: I was one of them.
MIKA: You flunked out of ninja school or

MR. OZUNU: He is wearing a black and gold watch. Bring it to me.
KINGPIN: Wait here. Gotta piss.
BODYGUARD: Want me to come with you, boss?
KINGPIN: Why? So you can shake it for me? You some kind of secret faggot?
KINGPIN: The fuck-?
OZUNU: Keep it. It will remind you that every minute of your life is a gift that I have given you.
MIKA: Okay, if you're not going to say anything, do you mind if I talk? When I get nervous, it helps if I
RAIZO: I know.
MIKA: Yeah, well usually if someone introduces themselves it is a convention that the other person does likewise.
RAIZO: Raizo.is the name I was given.
MIKA: So, you were an orphan?
RAIZO: Ninja only kill two kinds of people. The first kind has power and money. The other kind is trying to stop them.
MIKA: I understand retail therapy as well as any girl but I think it's a little late.
RAIZO: You are a size 36?
MIKA: What? No! Size 34.`cept certain times of the month.
RAIZO: If you leave while I am gone they will catch you and kill you.
RAIZO: Get undressed. Shower. Do not use the hotel soap. Or any towel. Do you smoke?
MIKA: He nods.
RAIZO: Put your clothes in here.
MIKA: Don't you know how to knock?
RAIZO: Don't you know how to knock?
MIKA: Don't you know how to knock?
RAIZO: I'm trying to save your life.
MIKA: .okay right.
RAIZO: Dry yourself with this.
MIKA: .I'm just a researcher. I'm really not equipped to deal with
RAIZO: Get dressed.
MIKA: These are a little tight.
RAIZO: You said 34.
MIKA: European sizes.run a little small I guess.
RAIZO: Let's go.
MIKA: Wow. They teach you that at ninja Most locks are not worth the metal they're made of.
RAIZO: Most locks are not worth the metal they're made of.
MIKA: You're going to steal a car?
RAIZO: Just borrow it.
MIKA: In for a penny, in for a pounding.
RAIZO: At ninja school I minored in electrical engineering.
RAIZO: Now we have some time.
MIKA: How much time?
RAIZO: A day. Maybe less.
MIKA: Make your call.
RAIZO: Make your call.
MIKA: Ryan, it's me.
MASLOW: Mika! For Christ sake I've been calling for hours!
MIKA: I know. I'm in a bit of trouble-
MASLOW: Trouble? You miss jury duty you're in trouble. You're in some kind of bottomless pit of deep Yeah. Least I'm not down here by

MIKA: Twenty heavily armed men emerge from the wall of light.
MILITARY MAN: Hands on your head! On your knees! Do it now!
MIKA: Raizo! No! This is wrong!
RAIZO: The clans have people everywhere.
MIKA: What are you doing?
MASLOW: Following orders.
OZUNU: Cut him.
SECURITY GOON: Prisoner is secure sir.
MASLOW: He scans the different monitors.
SECURITY GOON: No sir, we checked it.
MASLOW: Then why isn't he showing up?
SECURITY GOON: We think he's able to lower the temperature of his body to remain Or maybe he's just cold-blooded.
MASLOW: Or maybe he's just cold-blooded.
MIKA: Ryan, you know this is wrong! It can't be legal! What is this place? Your own private It's an old GDR safehouse. Jamison wants this off the grid.
MASLOW: It's an old GDR safehouse. Jamison wants this off the grid.
MIKA: Ryan you're making a huge mistake!
MASLOW: I don't think so. We got reports from Washington, London, Osaka all tagging your boy. Only problem we have is where to extradite him So two weeks ago, there's no such thing as a ninja and now every city in the world has a warrant for one?
MIKA: So two weeks ago, there's no such thing as a ninja and now every city in the world has a warrant for one?
MASLOW: We must respect the jurisprudence of the regional government and corresponding law enforcement He's not the enemy.
MIKA: He's not the enemy.
MASLOW: No? You ever heard of Stockholm Syndrome I'm getting the feeling I'm looking at a pretty serious case of it.
MIKA: I'm not crazy. This is!
MASLOW: He's a killer, Mika. Weren't you the one telling me it was our job to stop him.
MIKA: You're not listening to me!
MASLOW: You're not saying anything worth hearing. Look, if want to do the insubordination tango, let's go, but not in front of the kids okay? Boys, give us a minute.
MIKA: Damn it, Ryan, I
MASLOW: Listen to me, we don't have much time. Look, I don't know what you've stumbled into, but somebody is pulling some major strings They want him dead. He's been fighting them for years.
MIKA: They want him dead. He's been fighting them for years.
MASLOW: I believe you. I believe you. I've been in this business too long not to smell a set-up. But we have to be careful how we handle this. And I can't risk you going AWOL on me again, because I don't want anything to happen to you.
RAIZO: I told you. I tried to warn you.
KIRIKO: .yes, you did..
RAIZO: But you did it anyway. Why?
KIRIKO: Why am I in here for watering my tree.or why are you out there. watering me?
MIKA: Could you give us a moment?
GUARD: Negative. Not safe ma'am.
MIKA: If he wanted to hurt me he could have done that a while ago.
GUARD: Sorry ma'am. Maslow okayed the water. That's it.
MIKA: Hi.you looked thirsty.
RAIZO: I know.
MIKA: You do?
RAIZO: The only time you lied to me was when you told me your size.
MIKA: How did you know that?
RAIZO: Your heart. It is special.
MIKA: You know about my heart?
RAIZO: Hearts speak truer than

MIKA: Ryan, can I talk to you?
MASLOW: We have to do this again, Coretti?
MIKA: No sir. I just.I have reason to believe that a group of ninja may be on their way here.
MASLOW: I think these gentlemen can handle a few whack-jobs wearing pajamas. Am I right?
MIKA: But the situation we discussed-
MASLOW: I'm working on that. You have to give me a little time.
MIKA: We don't have time.
MASLOW: They're not here now.
MIKA: They'll be here soon.
MASLOW: How soon-
MIKA: Maslow spins as she sprints for the stairs.
MASLOW: Maslow draws his firearm and hisses at one of the Special

EUROPOL #2: What the fuck's with the lights?
EUROPOL GUARD: We got some guys in pajamas comin' to play spin the bottle.
EUROPOL #2: Huh huh. I got something they can wrap their lips around.
MIKA: I don't have time for this shit. We have to move the prisoner.
RAIZO: ( CONTINUED )
