DAVID: I paid for twenty you only gave me nineteen!
WEASEL: ( loving it ) You callin' me a liar, kid.?
DAVID: I want that other paper.
JACK: Nineteen, Weasel. An honest mistake on account of Oscar can't count to twenty with his shoes on.
WEASEL: Hold it. Race spot me two-bits.
JACK: Hold it. Race spot me two-bits.
JACK: Another fifty for my friend here.

LES: Cowboy! They call him Cowboy!
JACK: That and a lotta other things including Jack Kelly, which is what my mudder called me. What do they call you, kid?

LES: Near ten.
JACK: No good. Anybody asks, you're Younger sells more papes, Les and if we're gonna be partners

CRUTCHY: ( to David ) You're gettin' the chance of a lifetime here you learn from Jack, you learn from the best.
DAVID: If he's the best, then why does he need us?

DAVID: Gotta split fifty-fifty.
JACK: Sixty-forty. Or I forget the whole
JACK: The name of the game is volume, Dave. You only took twenty papes why?
DAVID: Bad headline.?
JACK: First t'ing you gotta learn headlines don't sell papes, newsies sell papes. We're what holds this town together without newsies, nobody knows nuttin'!
SEITZ: The news is slow, Chief, the Trolley Strike's all we got
PULITZER: Hearst is killing us in the circulation war and you give me headlines that would put a whirling dervish to sleep!
BUNSEN: ( nervous editor ) We'll get a new headline writer, Mr. Pulitzer.
PULITZER: Steal Hearst's man offer him double what Hearst pays.
SEITZ: That's how he stole him from us. Chief, you spend as much as you make fighting Hearst. That's why the paper's losing money
PULITZER: I created the World to be the best and I'll spend whatever it takes What is that deafening noise?
SEITZ: Just the Newsies, Chief, I'll
PULITZER: Never mind where was I?
SEITZ: Creating the World, Chief.
PULITZER: This paper's losing money because there's too much fat, inefficiency not because I'm fighting to make us number one! Well, we're going to cut costs, maximize profits and still beat the socks off Hearst I want to know how by tonight.
JACK: Some newsies got corners, see same spot, same customers. Me, I like to keep moving, enjoy the life of the big city. I spot an opportunity, I sell a pape. That's the advantage of being an independent businessman, instead of workin' for wages.
DAVID: Paper, mister? Extry 'Runaway Carriage Crushes
LES: ( earsplitting shout ) Extry 'Runaway Carriage Crushes
LES: He gimme a dime! He said I should go far away and keep the change!
JACK: You're a natural, kid. You remind me of me and I can't say greater than that.

JACK: 'Terrified flight from flaming inferno!' Thank you, much obliged
LES: Buy me last pape, mista.?
DAVID: Our father taught us not to lie.
JACK: Mine taught me not to starve. So we both got an education.
DAVID: You just make things up like those headlines.
JACK: I don't do nothin' the guys who write this stuff don't do. It ain't lyin' it's just improvin' the truth a little. The guy gave me a quarter! Quick, gimme some more last papers!
LES: The guy gave me a quarter! Quick, gimme some more last papers!
DAVID: ( grabs him ) Hold it I smell beer!
LES: The guy bet me I wouldn't drink some that's how I made the Hey, no drinkin' on the job it's bad for business. What if somebody called a cop or somethin'?

JACK: No? What're they doin' then?
DAVID: I think they're chasing you!
DAVID: I want some answers Why was he chasing you? What's the Refuge?
JACK: The Refuge is this jail for kids. That guy, Snyder, he's the warden.

JACK: I was starvin'. I stole some food.
DAVID: ( suspicious ) Right, food. He called you ( bridling ) Yeah, food. My name's Kelly, Jack Kelly, like I told you. Think I'm You have a way of 'improving the truth.' Why was he chasing you?
JACK: ( bridling ) Yeah, food. My name's Kelly, Jack Kelly, like I told you. Think I'm You have a way of 'improving the truth.' Why was he chasing you?

JACK: Because I escaped.

KLOPPMAN: You missed your supper, boys.
RACETRACK: Then we didn't miss much, did we?
JACK: I ate, Mr. Kloppman, I. . I was dinin' with a family.
JONATHAN: Actual income, as well as projected income, against actual operating costs, as well as projected operating costs, produce a reduced marginality of profit which in turn
PULITZER: Seitz! What in blazes is he talking Says you need to make more money, Of course I need to make more money! But how do I make more money, you bloodless blot?
SEITZ: Says you need to make more money, Of course I need to make more money! But how do I make more money, you bloodless blot?
PULITZER: Of course I need to make more money! But how do I make more money, you bloodless blot?
JONATHAN: ( unflappable ) I have several proposals. The first is to increase the paper's Then Hearst undersells me and I'm in the poorhouse. Brilliant.
PULITZER: Then Hearst undersells me and I'm in the poorhouse. Brilliant.
JONATHAN: Not the customer price the price to the distribution
SEITZ: You mean the Newsies.? Charge the Newsies more for their papers? Bad idea, Chief.
JONATHAN: Very well. My next proposal salary cuts, particularly those at the very top
PULITZER: Wait. What do the Newsies pay now fifty cents per hundred papers? If you raised it to sixty cents
JONATHAN: A mere tenth of a cent per paper
PULITZER: then that, multiplied by forty thousand papers a day, seven days a week well, it would pay some of the bills around here.
SEITZ: Chief, if you do this, every Newsie we got will head straight for Hearst.
PULITZER: Not necessarily. As newspapermen, Hearst and I would cut each other's throats to get the best of the other. But as businessmen and gentlemen we often agree on ways to keep down certain operating costs. If I know Willie Hearst, he's going to wish he thought of this himself.
SEITZ: What about the other papers ?
PULITZER: If we do it, they'll all do it. It's only a tenth of a cent nobody gets hurt! It's good for the Newsies an incentive, make 'em work harder, sell more papers! Now get me Hearst on that
KID BLINK: They jacked up the price! Ten cents a hunnerd I can eat two days on ten cents!
SKITTERY: This'll bust me I'm barely makin' a livin' now
BOOTSY: I'll be back sleepin' on the streets
MUSH: It don't make no sense! All the money Pulitzer makes, why would he gouge us? Jack sees Weasel behind his window, grinning.
JACK: Awright, pipe down! Don't you see it's a gag? Just Weasel bein' a weasel. Joke's over, Wease. Gimme a hunnerd.
WEASEL: Hunnerd'll cost ya sixty, Cowboy.
JACK: I ain't payin' no sixty
WEASEL: Then move outta the way
JACK: You bet I move right over to the Journal.
RACETRACK: It's the same at the Journal we checked it's the same everywhere!
JACK: Why the jack-up, Weasel?
WEASEL: Why not? It's a nice day. Why don't you ast Mr. Pulitzer?
WEASEL: If you ain't buyin' papes, clear out! World employees only on this sida the gates.
JACK: It stinks here anyway let's go!
KID BLINK: They can't do that to us
RACETRACK: They can do what they want it's their stinkin' paper
BOOTS: Ain't we got no rights ?
CRUTCHY: Sure we got the right to take it in the t'roat!
RACETRACK: It's a rigged deck why waste time kiddin' ourselves? They set the price, we gotta pay it
MUSH: We got no choice! So let's get our lousy papes while they still got some
JACK: Nobody's goin' anywhere they ain't gonna get away with this!
EVERYBODY: What can we do ( etc. )
LES: Stop crowding him! Let him think!
RACETRACK: ( tentatively ) Jack.? Ya still thinkin'. ?
JACK: One thing for sure. If we don't sell papes, then nobody sells papes. Nobody comes through those gates 'til they put the price back where it was.
DAVID: You mean like a strike.?
JACK: Yeah, a strike good idea, Dave.
DAVID: ( alarmed ) No, I didn't mean we can't strike, we're not a union
JACK: We go on strike, we're a union, right? Keep it comin', Dave
DAVID: ( pleading ) There's not enough of us maybe if we got every Newsie in New York
JACK: Yeah, we organize we get all the New York Newsies to join us! This is great, Dave, keep talkin'
DAVID: It's no joke! You saw what happened to those trolley workers
JACK: Another great idea! Any Newsie don't join with us, we soak 'im just like the trolley workers!
DAVID: Nooo! Stop and think, willya? You can't just rush everybody into
JACK: Dave's right again! We gotta think this through! Old man Pulitzer and Hearst and all them other rich geezers, they run this city. Do we really think a buncha streetrats like us would have a chance against people like them?
LES: The boys explode a beat begins to build
BOOTS: Keep talkin', Jack tell us what to do
DAVID: Uh. uh. Pulitzer and Hearst have to respect our rights
JACK: Pulitzer and Hearst have to respect the workin' boys of New York! Keep it comin' what else.
DAVID: Uh. they can't treat us like we don't exist.
JACK: PULITZER AND HEARST THEY THINK WE'RE NOTHING ARE WE NOTHING?
NEWSIE: If we stick together like the trolley workers, they can't break us up.
NO!: If we stick together like the trolley workers, they can't break us up.
DAVID: If we stick together like the trolley workers, they can't break us up.

JACK: The House of Refuge. my home- How can you be sure they sent Crutchy here?
DAVID: How can you be sure they sent Crutchy here?
JACK: How can I be sure the Delanceys stink 'cause that's how things work. An orphan gets arrested, Snyder gets him sent here to be the more kids in the Refuge, the more money the city sends to take care of 'em, and the more Snyder can steal. He's here alright.
TENPIN: Cowboy! Ya miss the joint?

JACK: They hurt you.? Don't worry, we'll carry you
CRUTCHY: ( vehemantly ) I don't want nobody carryin' me
CRUTCHY: It ain't so bad here. Get three squares, sorta, and there's some swell fellas. They still talk about how Jack rode outta here on that coach!
DAVID: ( sighs; resigned ) Teddy Roosevelt's. Right?
CRUTCHY: You already heard the story.
DAVID: You mean it's true ?
JACK: Crutchy won't last in there. I seen stronger guys than him not make it.
DAVID: Did you really escape in Teddy Roosevelt's coach?
JACK: Not in it. On it.
DAVID: What was he doing at the Refuge?
JACK: Runnin' for governor. Showin' his concern, like all pols during Teddy's not like other politicians. He's the biggest hero in the Anyway, he's there. I see his fancy coach waitin' for 'im, so I sneaks on top of it. Teddy gets in and he's wavin' goodbye, and all the guys are wavin' goodbye, and Snyder's wavin' 'Good-byeeee, Colonel Roosevelt!' So just as we're goin' out the gate, I stands up and 'Good-byeee, Warden Snyder!' It was in the papes and everything.

DAVID: ( laughs; then ) He's governor now. I don't understand how he could see that place and not do anything
JACK: He only seen what Snyder wanted him to good food, everything the city pays for that Snyder usually I'll bet if he just knew I mean, he's a hero
DAVID: I'll bet if he just knew I mean, he's a hero

BAILIFF: Awrise, awrise, court is now in session, Judge E.A. Monahan
MONAHAN: Any of you represented by counsel? No? Good. That'll move things along considerably.
SPOT: Judge Movealong, ya honor, I object.
MONAHAN: On what grounds?
SPOT: ( proudly ) On the grounds of Brooklyn, ya honor!
MONAHAN: I fine you each five dollars or two weeks confinement in

RACETRACK: Talk and eat, right? On you, huh,
JACK: Hiya, fellas! Hey, Denton guess we made all the papes this time, huh? How'd my picture look?
DENTON: None of the papers covered the rally. Not even The Sun. Case of Jack Kelly, inciting to riot, assault, resisting arrest.
BAILIFF: Case of Jack Kelly, inciting to riot, assault, resisting arrest.
SNYDER: Judge Monahan, I'll speak for this young man
JACK: ( mock surprise ) You two know each other? Ain't that nice.
MONAHAN: Just move it along, Warden Snyder.
SNYDER: This boy's real name is Francis Sullivan; mother deceased; father a convict in the state penitentiary
SNYDER: He is currently an escapee from the House of Refuge, where his original sentence of three months for theft was extended six months for disruptive behavior
JACK: Like demandin' you give us the food you steal from us
SNYDER: Followed by an additional six months for an attempted escape
JACK: ( fighting tears ) Last time wasn't no attempt, remember, Snyder? Me and Teddy Roosevelt wavin' bye-bye
SNYDER: Therefore, I ask that he be returned to the House of Refuge
JACK: For my own good, right, Movealong? and for what Snyder kicks back to ya
SNYDER: And that the court order his incarceration until the age of DAVID/NEWSIES SNYDER ( on their feet ) In the hope that we So ordered. Next.

BOOTS: They're buildin' some mighty good jails these days.
RACETRACK: So where's Denton?
DAVID: He said he'd be here. We can't let this stop us. We gotta keep the strike going, just like Jack was here.
MUSH: ( the sad truth ) Yeah, but Jack ain't here.
RACETRACK: We know that, genius if he was here, he'd be tellin' us what to do when he ain't here.
SPOT: ( gets up ) You bummers is givin' me a Where you goin'? We need you.

SPOT: Nachally Spot Conlon is needed wherever which right now is Brooklyn. Some of my boys is worried, I must give ear to their
DAVID: Why didn't The Sun print the story?
DENTON: Because it never happened.
DENTON: If it's not in the papers, then it never happened. The owners decreed that it not be in the papers, therefore. I just came to tell you fellows Denton, what's happened you get fired or somethin'?
DAVID: Denton, what's happened you get fired or somethin'?
DENTON: Reassigned back to my old job as The Sun's ace war correspondent. The owner thinks I should be covering only the 'really important' stories. So wish me luck, boys. At least half what I wish you. They don't always fire you, David.
DAVID: They bought you off. didn't they? Didn't they!
DENTON: They could've blackballed me from every paper in the country. I'm a newspaperman, I have to have a paper to write for. This is the story I wrote about the rally. I want you to read it at least.
DENTON: This is the story I wrote about the rally. I want you to read it at least.
DAVID: ( decisively ) We bust Jack out of the Refuge tonight. From now on, we depend on nobody but the Newsies.
DAVID: That's where we saw Crutchy.
MUSH: Where they takin' him.?
DAVID: One way to find out. Meet me back at the square!
SEITZ: Get him inside.
JACK: Very impressive. So where do they keep the trains in this station?
JACK: ( grins ) Sorry to see you ain't doin' so good, Joe.
PULITZER: Know what I was doing when I was your age? I was in a war. The Civil War.
JACK: I heard of it. You win?
PULITZER: People think wars are about right and wrong. They're not. They're about power. You know what power Heard of that, too. I don't just sell ya papes, Joe. Sometimes I read 'em.
JACK: Heard of that, too. I don't just sell ya papes, Joe. Sometimes I read 'em.
PULITZER: Power means that I could see to it that you serve your full sentence at the Refuge. Or I could pull strings and have you free tomorrow. It means I could give you my pocket change and you'd have more money than you'd likely ever You bribin' me, Joe? Thanks for the compliment, but I ain't got the power to stop the strike
JACK: You bribin' me, Joe? Thanks for the compliment, but I ain't got the power to stop the strike
PULITZER: I disagree. You're the spirit of the strike, without you, they'd fall apart in a few days.
JACK: Ring for my coach, willya? It's past my bedtime
PULITZER: Shut your mouth and listen ! You're going to do exactly as I say
JACK: or what? You'll send me back to the Refuge? I'll bust out and be a fugitive who's pursued and caught and returned. I'm offering you a choice is that what you choose?
PULITZER: and be a fugitive who's pursued and caught and returned. I'm offering you a choice is that what you choose?
JACK: I told ya. I can't call off the I'm not asking you to. All I ask is that you return to your old job as Newsie for the The World.
PULITZER: I'm not asking you to. All I ask is that you return to your old job as Newsie for the The World.
JACK: And be a scab? Forget it
PULITZER: For a few days. Then the strike ends and it will end, boy, make no mistake and you can go wherever you want to buy a ticket. Free and clear, with money in your pocket. and no one chasing you.
PULITZER: You go back to the Refuge. Think it over in your cell. Let me know in the morning.
DAVID: ( CONTINUED )
SNYDER: ( to the driver ) After him!
SEITZ: ( stepping up to Snyder ) Don't worry. He's got no place to go.
DAVID: Why're you stoppin' we've got to run!
JACK: You shouldn't'a done this, David. They could put you in jail
DAVID: It's worth it let's go
JACK: You go to jail, what happens to your family? You don't know nothin' about jail! Thanks for what you done, but you gotta get outta here
DAVID: I don't understand
JACK: I don't either I don't understand nothin' no more!

MAYER: There. You see?
SARAH: It's Denton's story. 'The Dark Truth: Why Our City Really Fears the Newsie Strike, by Bryan Denton. Last night I saw naked force exercised against mere boys, the Newsies, who earn at best a few pennies a day. I wondered why so much, against so little '

WEASEL: Sleep well, cowboy.?
OSCAR: Come wit' us, cowboy we're gonna fix your pal Davey today fix 'im so's he can't walk no more.
MORRIS: He backhands Morris in the chops and they move on. Jack starts after them, alarmed then he sees Weasel.
WEASEL: Lift one finger. and you're right back in the Refuge.
SARAH: Les, come on you're supposed to be helping me today.

SARAH: David! Run get away!
OSCAR: Yeah, run, Davey! We got the best parta ya family right here!
SARAH: David, no don't !
LES: Jack flashes him a grin as he works on Morris's bread basket. Just as Oscar frees himself from the derby, David leaps on him like a fury. Punches fly and the Delanceys beat a quick retreat down the sidewalk, yelling But they're the ones running. David, catching his breath, looks at Jack, beginning to understand.
MORRIS: Ya better run, cowboy we're tellin' Weasel! You'll be back in the Refuge by supper time! OSCAR But they're the ones running. David, catching his breath, looks at Jack, beginning to understand.
DAVID: Couldn't stay away, huh.

MAYER: I don't know what's waiting for you in Santa Fe, but you'll always have family here.
SARAH: ( decisively ) You're not going to run away. They'll just come after you. You have to fight them.
JACK: They got it all wrapped up, Sarah and nothin' I can do is gonna make one bit of difference.
SARAH: You're wrong. You touched people you don't even know about.
SARAH: Denton's story.
JACK: Denton looked out for hisself just like I gotta do so save it.
SARAH: Just listen! 'The men who run this city are terrified of the Newsies strike because other child laborers in the factories and sweatshops are hearing the message of the Newsies leader '
LES: That's you! He's writin' about you!
SARAH: 'In the voice of Jack Kelly, these children hear strength and pride. Most of all, they hear hope.'
JACK: Keep reading.
DENTON: ' And that is what terrifies the powers-that-be, for they know our city thrives on the shame of child labor. Therefore, Jack Kelly's voice must be stopped, whatever the cost. Damn good writing, isn't it?
JACK: All them sweatshop kids are listenin' to me.?
DENTON: They think if the Newsies can do it, why can't they? All they need is a leader.
JACK: The minute I show my face, I'm back in the Refuge.
DENTON: You'd have help this time. I've been investigating the Refuge I know somebody who's going to be very interested in Snyder's little What happened to the ace war This war'll do for now.
DAVID: ( wryly ) What happened to the ace war This war'll do for now.
DENTON: This war'll do for now.
SARAH: Whatever happens, it's Jack's decision. He's the one in danger.
LES: Jack.? You thinkin'.?
JACK: Yeah. I'm thinkin' of Newsie Square full of kids.
DAVID: ( picks it up ) . Another rally, right under Pulitzer's nose, and not just the Every workin' kid from every sweatshop in New York. We gotta get the word out let's go get the Newsies ( catches himself ) They still think I'm a scab.
JACK: Every workin' kid from every sweatshop in New York. We gotta get the word out let's go get the Newsies They still think I'm a scab.
LES: I'll tell 'em you was a spy!
DENTON: How're you gonna reach all these people? No paper in New York will print anything about the strike.
JACK: We're Newsies, ain't we? So we make our own paper.
DAVID: Be quiet and let me think.
JACK: Whattaya need to start a paper? Writers, right? So we got Denton. What else?
LES: ( as they look at him ) ( the cold facts ) A printing press. And no paper or printer is going to defy Pulitzer.
DENTON: ( the cold facts ) A printing press. And no paper or printer is going to defy Pulitzer.
JACK: Les. Go set me straight with the Newsies, okay? Tell 'em to meet us later at the World Building.
JACK: So happens I know a guy with a printing press.
