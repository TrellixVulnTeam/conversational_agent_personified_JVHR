FINAL SCRIPT: November 2006
READER NOTE: One thing that will be obvious to viewers, but not to readers, is that the nine principal parts in this film are played by only three actors: It'll make more sense in context. Promise.

GARY: Are there reporters out front?
MARGARET: A few. Not Hugh Grant level. More like Robert Downey, Jr. when he broke into that family's house and slept in the kid's bed like Goldilocks. "This bed is just right." I handled episodes two through four for Robert. This sort of thing is my specialty.

GARY: It's the parole system.
RAT TRAP,: which SNAPS down on his toes. He SCREAMS, pulling it off. He looks around to find all eight traps are now on the main floor, rather than the second-floor walkway. Limping, he hops out the door. We stay behind, looking out through the open door.

GAVIN: Gavin's PUGS pounce all over him.
SUSAN: I just don't know if you need the cold open. People want to get right to the story.
GAVIN: I invited Susan to see a rough cut because I trust her taste.
SUSAN: Could we be more clear why Mary is so freaked out at that moment?
GAVIN: Wow. I thought it was pretty obvious. And dramatic.
GAVIN [INTERVIEW]: More importantly, I trust her as a barometer of Roger's taste.
SUSAN: I know. But that's Roger's big thing this season. Never let the audience be confused.
GAVIN: So we're trying to squeeze in a wild line over this shot of Noelle.
MELISSA: What's the line?
GAVIN: ( quickly ) How could you.
MELISSA: Howkajew. It sounds like kosher drug paraphernalia. Like, come on Shmuley! Have a toke on the I know. It's just for the test They really think people won't get The dumb people might not.

GAVIN: That guy's looking at me.
SUSAN: He can't see you.
MODERATOR: How about you? Did you feel it It's not real.
AGITATED MAN: It's not real.
MODERATOR: And what do you mean by that?
AGITATED MAN: The show's not real. Why can't you see that? Jesus! Are you fucking You think you're above it all, don't you? You are trapped here with the rest of them, brother.
GAVIN: The guy was crazy. Obviously. The show is kinda twisted, and it just flipped something in him.
GAVIN: Oblivio accebit. It's Latin. "Oblivion approaches."
GAVIN: Other than the world is coming to an end? "Oblivio" also means forgetting, forgetfulness. I think that's what I'm going to do. Forget it.
SUSAN: Did you have a chance to look at the cards yet?
GAVIN: From the screening?
MELISSA: Pardon me. Daddy needs his drink.
MELISSA: ( yelling back ) I'm a-comin! ( to Gavin ) I still love you most.
SUSAN: ( continuing her thought ) People write stuff on the cards they won't say in a focus group. They get more specific.
GAVIN: The Nines.
SUSAN: They're the one who think your show is almost the best thing they've ever seen. They get your vision. They just want it to be even
MELISSA: Round two is starting without you!
SUSAN: So you'll look at the cards?
GAVIN: Making his way back to the living room, he stops by the phone. Pulls out an orange Post-It and makes a note. As he leaves, we go in CLOSE to read it:
SUSAN: Sometimes the numbers point things out that you don't want to admit to yourself. In this case, Melissa.
GAVIN: She doesn't have a ton to do in the pilot. There's so much to set up, you don't get a lot of Melissa- True. That's one of the challenges with a premise pilot.
SUSAN: True. That's one of the challenges with a premise pilot.
GAVIN: But the network still likes the Of course. Roger is your biggest How about above Roger?
SUSAN: Of course. Roger is your biggest How about above Roger?

SUSAN: They haven't seen it. They're watching all the pilots on Friday.
GAVIN: Why are you focusing on Melissa?
SUSAN: Because she's the biggest concern.
GAVIN: She's also the biggest star in the No, you're the biggest star. Roger made a huge deal with you, and he went along with casting Melissa when that wasn't his instinct.
SUSAN: No, you're the biggest star. Roger made a huge deal with you, and he went along with casting Melissa when that wasn't his instinct.
GAVIN: Well, hooray for Roger. I don't understand what you want me to do.
SUSAN: Meet with someone.
GAVIN: Dahlia Salem.
SUSAN: Dahlia Salem.
GAVIN: Yes. And you put her in Gatin's It's dead. It's dying. But the network loves Dahlia. So if she could jump over to your show.
SUSAN: It's dead. It's dying. But the network loves Dahlia. So if she could jump over to your show.
GAVIN: Replace Melissa and reshoot the Roger would pay for it. So is this even about Melissa?
SUSAN: Roger would pay for it. So is this even about Melissa?
GAVIN: So is this even about Melissa?
SUSAN: It's about getting your show on the air. That's all that matters in the end.
GAVIN: I see why the network loves her. It's just, I wrote the part for Melissa. She's one of my best friends. And in my head, I only see Melissa for the role. Could Dahlia do it? Absolutely. It could work. I just don't know if I want it to work.
OMIT: 238 238
GAVIN: When I get stressed out, I play videogames. It's my therapy. I can't have them on my own computer, because then I'd never write. So I come down to Koreatown.
GAVIN: If we're really going to replace Melissa, I want to hear it from

MELISSA: Your house is really old.
GAVIN: 1926. Ever since I got back, I feel like there's someone else there. And then last night, I thought I heard something. A woman Shit. Like a ghost?
MELISSA: Shit. Like a ghost?
GAVIN: I guess. And then I saw something. I ran into someone.
MELISSA: The woman?
GAVIN: It was a man. I think it was me.
MELISSA: Your house is haunted by yourself?
GAVIN: Gavin, are you alright?
MELISSA: Gavin, are you alright?
GAVIN: No. No.
MELISSA: Oh my God.
GAVIN: And I'm letting them, because I really want the show on the air. I have all these characters inside my head, and they want to live. I'm the only way they can. This is the only way they can. I have five seasons mapped out, and though it sucks, either you go away, or the show goes. I had to make a decision, and that's the decision I made. I'm sorry.
MELISSA: So it's done. Finished. Decided.
GAVIN: I understand. It's not your fault. You're morally incapable of doing the right thing.
MELISSA: I understand. It's not your fault. You're morally incapable of doing the right thing.
GAVIN: I don't want to do this on camera.
MELISSA: No, because you can't control it. Your little puppets are off their strings, running around. Saying things you didn't write. Reality terrifies you.
GAVIN: The reality is, you would not be here without me. I gave you your first few roles. And your career is a result of that.
MELISSA: The reality is, you would not be here without me. I gave you your first few roles. And your career is a result of that.
GAVIN: The reality is, you would not be here without me. I gave you your first few roles. And your career is a result of that.
MELISSA: God, thank you. Thank you for finally playing that card. I always knew you were holding onto it, the "I invented Melissa McCarthy card." Congratulations, you win. The game is over. She leaves him sitting at the table.
SUSAN: Upfronts is the week each year when the networks present their fall schedule to advertisers.
GAVIN: Sort of like, "Here's our new shit. Like it?" Upfronts is a complete oxymoron, because no one is remotely honest.
SUSAN: The schedule is a secret until it's announced, so everything is still in play.
GAVIN: But hey! At least you're in New
GAVIN: It's surreal being here. None of this is how I planned it.
WOMAN'S VOICE: God. Hi. Gavin. You're doing your.show.
DAHLIA: You're doing your.show.
GAVIN: Get on. Come join reality
DAHLIA: Just now. This whole last 24 hours has been surreal.

GAVIN: Please. Call anytime. I don't I just felt weird about what
DAHLIA: I just felt weird about what
GAVIN: Did something happen?
GAVIN: So I just bumped into Dahlia Salem, star of my show.
JUMP CUT: SUSAN ( CONT'D )
GATINS: Look, I'm sorry. But I'm kind of not. I want my show on the air. And I think it was shitty for you to go after Dahlia behind my back.
GAVIN: I heard your show was gone.
GATINS: I "heard" you fired Melissa McCarthy without having a backup. Why would they pick up your show when you don't have a star?
GAVIN: The network wanted Dahlia.
GATINS: Yeah, in my show. We tested right before you. Our numbers were through the roof.
GAVIN: Really. Who's your exec?
GATINS: Really. Who's your exec?
GAVIN: Susan Howard.
GATINS: She would know. She was there. Ask her.
SUSAN: ( on phone ) I'm at the UTA party. Yeah. Did you hear about Ricky's assistant? She literally shat herself. No, I saw it.
GAVIN: I will break your fucking finger.
SUSAN: ( to phone ) I'll call you back.
GAVIN: They're only picking up two dramas.
SUSAN: They're only picking up two dramas.
GAVIN: The rest is, what, reality?
SUSAN: You can go mid-season.
GAVIN: You can go to Hell.
SUSAN: She takes a beat, trying to size him up.
GAVIN: Didn't you?
SUSAN: G., I'm on your side. Trust me, I'm the only one who is trying to protect you.
GAVIN: All I want to know is why.
SUSAN: You want a motive?
GAVIN: This isn't "Crime Lab." No one got My show did. So tell me why.
SUSAN: This isn't "Crime Lab." No one got My show did. So tell me why.
GAVIN: My show did. So tell me why.
SUSAN: I had to get you away from her. She was holding you back.
GAVIN: You had to give her up. C'mon, G. If she really mattered, you couldn't have betrayed her so I didn't.
SUSAN: You had to give her up. C'mon, G. If she really mattered, you couldn't have betrayed her so I didn't.
GAVIN: I didn't.
SUSAN: What, you're the victim? The big Creator can't stand up to one little d-girl? It was your choice. I didn't make you do anything. I mean, do you have any principles? Do you believe in anything but your own ego?
GAVIN: Fuck you.
SUSAN: Your dialogue used to be sharper. Maybe Gatins could do a polish.
GAVIN: Look, I don't want to do this anymore. My show's not going to happen, so this show is over.
GAVIN: I'm fine.
OCTAVIA: Who were you talking to?
MUCH WIDER: We see Gavin and the woman on the corner. There's no camera Gavin could have been talking to. He's understandably perplexed: Where did the documentary crew go? Was there ever anyone there? Our CAMERA style has changed: instead of handheld and jerky, we're smooth and slow. The MUSIC has completely changed, underscoring a sense of creeping dread. We HOLD for a long beat. The light changes. Still a little unnerved, Octavia begins to cross the street. Only then do we notice something unusual floating above her A SPHERE OF BLUE LIGHT. WIDER, we see that everyone on the street has the same kind of sphere floating a foot above their heads. No one seems to see the lights other than Gavin. Gavin looks around in uneasy fascination, as if he's just landed on an alien world. A beat, then he has an unsettling thought. He slowly looks up. Above his own head, he sees the same sphere of light only his is bright white. Pulsing.
GAVIN: Oh God.
MARGARET: I can understand why you're a little confused.
GARY: No. I'm a lot confused.
MARGARET: This is all a dream.
GARY: This is all a dream.
MARGARET: I'm in a coma.
GARY: I'm in a coma.
MARGARET: ( amused ) Then I'm dead. This is Hell, or Purgatorium or something.
GARY: Then I'm dead. This is Hell, or Purgatorium or something.
MARGARET: Okay, a purgatorium is where Romans vomited. But no. This is as real as anything can be.
GARY: ( suspicious ) What does that mean?
MARGARET: Everything is what it is. But you're not who you think you are.
GARY: Okay, then. Who am I?
MARGARET: You're a multi-dimensional being of vast, almost infinite power. You created this world on a whim, and decided to stick around to see how it turned out. You, this body you're in, is just one of your incarnations. Avatars. Call you what you will.
GARY: Are you saying I'm God?
MARGARET: Technically, no. If God is a ten a theoretical ultimate, that-which- you're more of a nine.
GARY: So what are you?
MARGARET: Humans are sevens. Monkeys are What are the eights?
GARY: What are the eights?
MARGARET: Koalas. They're telepathic. Plus, they control the weather.
GARY: I understand. But I don't believe
MARGARET: I understand. But I don't believe
GARY: I understand. But I don't believe
KNOWING: FADE IN: 301 301 EXT. MEADOW - DAY In a WIDE SHOT, we see a vast field, bordered by green mountains. Unseen BIRDS call out from the trees, while insects CLICK and WHIRR. In the distance, we spot swatches of bright colors moving our way. It's a family: father GABRIEL ( 34 ), wife MARY ( 33 ) and daughter NOELLE ( 8 ). They're returning from a short day hike. Mary carries a small videocamera. Seeing that Noelle is already a ways down the path.
GABRIEL: Noelle! Don't get too far ahead.
MARY: No. You had ice cream at lunch.
GABRIEL: ( to Mary ) Apparently frozen yogurt doesn't I'll make note.
MARY: I'll make note.
MARY: Did you hit it?
GABRIEL: Shouldn't have to.
MARY: Noelle signs her made-up representation of "shit."
GABRIEL: Battery is dead. Least the starter
MARY: How do we.?
GABRIEL: We call the service. That's all we can do.
MARY: It's just the little battery that's dead, right? The big one is probably fine.
GABRIEL: I guess.
MARY: We can't jump it from one battery to the other? Cross-over somehow?
GABRIEL: Who did you marry? MacGyver?
MARY: Are you getting a signal?
GABRIEL: No. Do you?
MARY: Yes! One bar.
GABRIEL: The minute you try to place a call, the bar goes away.
MARY: Keep trying.
GABRIEL: Okay, I'll keep trying, Mary. But it will keep happening.
MARY: Well, what do you want to do?
GABRIEL: I don't know.
MARY: Maybe if you hold it up higher.
GABRIEL: The problem is we're boxed in. It's a canyon.
MARY: That's at least a mile.
GABRIEL: I can run that.
MARY: So.we stay here?
GABRIEL: You okay with that?
MARY: I don't think we have a choice, so, yeah. Go.
GABRIEL: Daddy's going to get a truck to help us out. You take care of your mom, okay?
GABRIEL: Excuse me! Hi! Hello?
SIERRA: No, I don't. There's no service up Yeah, I'm finding that out.
GABRIEL: ( re: his phone ) Yeah, I'm finding that out.
SIERRA: You can usually get a signal up at the ranger station.
GABRIEL: She points in the opposite direction back the way he came.
SIERRA: You follow the road. It's probably. I don't know. You have a car?
GABRIEL: It's dead. That's why I need.
SIERRA: She pulls a stray hair back from her mouth. Notices him noticing her.
GABRIEL: A beat. She takes a subtle step closer to the center of the She doesn't leap to extend an invitation. It takes a beat for Gabriel to figure out why.
SIERRA: I can call somebody when I get to
GABRIEL: I believe you. I do. But you don't know where the car is. And the guy might not come. We can't be up here all night.
SIERRA: I'm sorry.
GABRIEL: Don't be sorry. Just help me out No. I can't. I'm sorry.
SIERRA: No. I can't. I'm sorry.
GABRIEL: Why won't you trust me?
MARY: Okay, but you have to be careful, understand? You have to use Big Girl hands.
GABRIEL: Were you following me?
SIERRA: Once I was sure you weren't following me. I'm sorry, it's You thought I was Ted Bundy.
GABRIEL: You thought I was Ted Bundy.
SIERRA: My name's Gabriel. Bundy.
GABRIEL: My name's Gabriel. Bundy.
SIERRA: They shake.
GABRIEL: So, listen. I'm parked that way.
SIERRA: So, listen. I'm parked that way.
GABRIEL: Yeah. Make up some karma.
SIERRA: Yeah. Make up some karma.
GABRIEL: Lead the way.
SIERRA: Okay, confession. I kind of recognized you.
GABRIEL: I wasn't sure, but I think I saw a picture of you in some videogame magazine my boyfriend had. You're, like, the shit.
SIERRA: I wasn't sure, but I think I saw a picture of you in some videogame magazine my boyfriend had. You're, like, the shit.
GABRIEL: You're like the Quentin Tarantino of that world. A videogame God.
SIERRA: You're like the Quentin Tarantino of that world. A videogame God.
GABRIEL: Not really.

GABRIEL: You had an account?
SIERRA: I was part of your world, and you didn't even know it.
GABRIEL: You can make it up to me.
SIERRA: You can make it up to me.
MAN'S VOICE: .I have five seasons mapped out, and though it sucks, either you go away, or the show goes. I had to make a decision, and that's the decision I made. I'm sorry.
SIERRA: So you play a lot of characters at A couple. Most people do.
GABRIEL: A couple. Most people do.
SIERRA: You're not most people. You created the world. You know all the secret codes.
GABRIEL: What, like `God mode'?
SIERRA: That's what you call it?
GABRIEL: That's when you have all the powers, and you can't be killed. It's fine when you're designing, but it's really boring to play. A game isn't fun unless there are And you make the rules.
SIERRA: And you make the rules.
GABRIEL: Yes I do. I mean, you want to give everyone freedom, but they can't handle it. Half your players are teenage boys, and it's like they're programmed to be destructive.
SIERRA: Do you think I'm pretty?
GABRIEL: Do you think I'm hot? On a purely physical level.
SIERRA: Do you think I'm hot? On a purely physical level.
GABRIEL: He drinks.
SIERRA: That's a rave.
GABRIEL: Well, I don't know why you're My ex-boyfriend, the orc, he says, "What I like about you is that you're not so hot that I'm afraid of losing you."
SIERRA: My ex-boyfriend, the orc, he says, "What I like about you is that you're not so hot that I'm afraid of losing you."
GABRIEL: So where's the orc now?
SIERRA: He's dead. I spiked his water bottle with a massive quantity of GHB. He hallucinated, went into convulsions and died.
GABRIEL: Remind me not to piss you off,
SIERRA: He's surprised. He could have sworn her name was Sarah.
GABRIEL: And what makes you think you haven't pissed me off already?
SIERRA: And what makes you think you haven't pissed me off already?
MARY: How are you doing, kiddo?
NOELLE: He's not coming back. How could you.
MARY: How could you.
IX: He's sweating a lot.
GABRIEL: Am I crazy, or is it getting Oh, you're crazy.
SIERRA: Oh, you're crazy.
GABRIEL: I have a wife. And a daughter. They're waiting for me.
SIERRA: Where are they?
GABRIEL: Back at the car.
SIERRA: I mean, which direction?
GABRIEL: They're back.
SIERRA: Face it, G.: You don't know where they are. You don't know where you are. We've been walking in circles for an hour.
GABRIEL: Where's your car?
SIERRA: There is no car. That was all a. "pretense," I guess. An excuse to get you alone.
GABRIEL: What's happening?
SIERRA: I'm sorry it had to come this, G. But it'll all be over soon.
GABRIEL: You're trying to kill me.
SIERRA: No! No. This isn't a murder. It's an intervention.
SUSAN: I had to get you away from her. She was holding you back. You had to give her up.
GAVIN: I can you out of here. But you have to trust me.
SARAH: I can you out of here. But you have to trust me.
SUSAN: Do you feel like a man? You're
SIERRA: That's right. Just let it go. Let it go. Why are you doing this?
GABRIEL: Why are you doing this?
SIERRA: You did it to yourself. Admitting that is the first step.
OCTAVIA: Because you forgot who you were.
AGITATED MAN: You forgot this wasn't real.
AGITATED MAN: You can't describe it with human
OCTAVIA: You can't think it with human That's why you have to come back. Come back with us. With me.
OMIT: 316 316
MARGARET: You could destroy the world with a single thought. Don't, incidentally. Just file that away. But the truth is, you hold all the cards: every church, every candle, every sacrifice that's for you. When people pray, they're not praying because they want this thing or that thing. They just don't want to be
MARY: Noelle? Noelle!
GABRIEL: Maybe if I just cut back, didn't get so involved.
SIERRA: We both know that'll never work. Next week, you'll be back here redesigning the pinecones. You have to quit cold-turkey.
GABRIEL: I can't.
SIERRA: You can. But I can't force you to leave. You have to want it.
OMIT: 318 318

MARY: You need to go, don't you?
GABRIEL: No. I can stay.
MARY: How long? Forever? Every day, you'd know what you were missing.
GABRIEL: Worst-case scenario? Spontaneous disintegration into a fiery void. Oblivio accebit. The end of That's all?
MARY: That's all?
GABRIEL: That probably wouldn't happen. The basic structure of the universe should hold. I guess I'm just worried about the human factor. You guys kill each other a lot.
MARY: In fairness, that's usually in your name. Plus we've gotten much more efficient at it.
GABRIEL: I like this world. I like my life, here, with you and Noelle.
MARY: But it's not real. I'm not really your wife, you're not really my husband. On some level, it's all It's not pretend. There's a reason you were there, in every version. You were my sister, my wife, my best friend.
GABRIEL: It's not pretend. There's a reason you were there, in every version. You were my sister, my wife, my best friend.
MARY: That's a little creepy.
GABRIEL: I wanted you close. In one version, I even told you. I warned you that some day they might come for me, and.
MARY: .You'd have to leave. How many versions were there?
GABRIEL: Ninety. This is the last one.
MARY: I've destroyed billions of people with a thought. Obliterated them. And you'd like to think it's Stop. You don't have to explain, or apologize. Everything that is, is because of you. If that's all, that's enough.
GABRIEL: I've destroyed billions of people with a thought. Obliterated them. And you'd like to think it's Stop. You don't have to explain, or apologize. Everything that is, is because of you. If that's all, that's enough.
MARY: Stop. You don't have to explain, or apologize. Everything that is, is because of you. If that's all, that's enough.
GABRIEL: Guess you don't really need to pack I'm good.
MARY: Guess you don't really need to pack I'm good.
GABRIEL: I'm good.
MARY: You're great. It's been a Likewise. I love you.
GABRIEL: Likewise. I love you.
MARY: Love you, too. Ya big lug.
GABRIEL: You're my favorite.
M: We should.
BEN: Cinnamon, too.
NOELLE: ( to Ben ) If I had a horse.
BEN: And if I had another horse.
NOELLE: And if I had another horse.
BEN: No, Flash.
NOELLE: No, Flash.
M: She beckons Noelle over. Tucks back the little girl's hair. Keeping her voice low enough so Ben can't hear:
NOELLE: Noelle smiles. M smiles too, a little embarrassed.
M: Right. Exactly.
NOELLE: He's not coming back. But it's gonna be okay. He put the pieces together, it's like.
M: The best of all possible worlds.
BEN: Honey? Is it supposed to stick like this?
M: We should help him.
THE END: ADDITIONAL MATERIAL The following scene ( Scene 99 ) is the conversation between S and G that plays near the end of Part Three. The plan is to shoot this scene in almost every setup of the film that involves both characters be it in Part One, Two or Three. So we'll be shooting this scene a lot. We'll then be intercutting the best of all these moments to create one 99 99 INT./EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS
