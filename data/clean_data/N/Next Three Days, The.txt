ERIT: So, your boss isn't threatened by

ERIT: And you would describe her as That has nothing to do with it!
LARA: That has nothing to do with it!
ERIT: And there is my answer.
JOHN: Either of you like another drink?
ERIT: Women should work under men, men under women. That's it.

ERIT: That's fine, too. They're used to it! Why are you I don't know, bro, but I think I'd rather work under you than her.
MICK: ( re: Erit ) I don't know, bro, but I think I'd rather work under you than her.
ERIT: ( insulted, shoots back ) Oh please, I'd rather work under him, too.
LARA: You'd rather "work under" John?
ERIT: You have a problem with that, too?
LARA: No, why would I have a problem with your little sexual innuendo?
ERIT: What is up your ass tonight??
LARA: So, I shouldn't take offense that you're coming on to my husband right in front of me.
ERIT: ( claws out now ) Lara, if I wanted your husband I would have him.
LARA: How? You couldn't possibly show him more of your tits.
ERIT: You know what your problem is?!

LARA: We went to her office party, idiot.
JOHN: I think she hit on me that night,
LARA: You are completely delusional. She wasn't even hitting on you in there; I just don't like her.
JOHN: I understand. People who look like that should not be allowed anywhere near oral surgery. You are such an asshole.

JOHN: You're in the chair trying to stay calm; how are you supposed to do that with those things hanging over your

LARA: ( ignoring him ) When's your last class?
JOHN: Three, and I have papers to grade. Can you pick up Luke?
LARA: After yesterday I probably don't have a job anyway. Do you think it was wrong to call her a useless cow?
JOHN: Bosses admire that kind of frank Did you call your father?
LARA: ( pulls note off fridge ) Did you call your father?
JOHN: ( heading for bathroom ) "When?" Yesterday, for his birthday!
LARA: ( heading for bathroom ) "When?" Yesterday, for his birthday!
LARA: You're completely impossible.
JOHN: Mom said Happy Birthday and my father went . Made me tear up.
LARA: Ever think that someone has to be the bigger person here?
JOHN: ( to Luke ) Remember this for the custody hearing: how Mommy is always scolding Daddy.
LARA: How are you going to feel if Luke grows up and doesn't call you?
JOHN: Now she's driving a wedge between us.

JOHN: About the appeal? Yes, and I'm just not telling you. What did Meyer to rule.
LARA: It can take months for the court to rule.
JOHN: It can take months for the court to rule.
LARA: I saw that woman. She was there. She couldn't have just disappeared.
JOHN: Meyer's looking for a new Her coat snagged my purse, I felt a button pop - they must have been blind not to find it.
LARA: Her coat snagged my purse, I felt a button pop - they must have been blind not to find it.

JOHN: ( holds up a Subway bag ) I figured you had to eat.
MEYER: Do you have the ruling in Brennan?
JOHN: But what if we find the woman who was leaving the parking lot?
MEYER: The PCRA was rejected. No new evidence can be submitted. Not It was a robbery! Someone stole her And if they'd used her credit cards we would have had something to argue. I'm sorry; this really.sucks.

MEYER: And if they'd used her credit cards we would have had something to argue. I'm sorry; this really.sucks.
JOHN: So, that's it. Now we just have the Supreme Court.
MEYER: John, in the last thirty years, the Supreme Court hasn't heard one murder case. No decent lawyer would even file the pleadings.
JOHN: So, I need to find an indecent one?
MEYER: No, I'm going to file it. But I need you to do something for me.
JOHN: ( CONTINUED )
MEYER: I need you to look at the evidence and just forget Lara is your wife.
JOHN: ( stopped by that ) I've seen the evidence, Meyer.
MEYER: I'm not saying judge her innocent or guilty, I'm just saying look at it. He co-worker sees her leaving the scene, she has the victim's blood on her clothes, her fingerprints on the murder weapon

MEYER: And the fight in the office.
JOHN: Everyone fights with their boss!
MEYER: But this one ended up dead.
JOHN: So, you never believed she was How can you say that?
MEYER: How can you say that?
JOHN: So, what are you saying, Meyer?!
MEYER: That it no longer matters what we believe; Lara's not getting out. And you have no idea how much I hate saying that.
JOHN: ( exiting ) I'll find someone to file the John! Come on! For Christ's sake.
MEYER: John! Come on! For Christ's sake.
JOHN!!: John is long gone. Meyer hurls his sandwich into the trash.
ERIT: I know you won't want to hear this.
MICK: Erit, go put somebody to sleep.
JOHN: Had to be done. I am really going to pay for that.
MICK: Had to be done. I am really going to pay for that.
JOHN: Lara Brennan; my wife. She was sent up here. Brennan. B-R-
DUTY NURSE: ( finds name in roster ) She can't have visitors.
JOHN: That's ridiculous; I have to see I'm sorry.
DUTY NURSE: I'm sorry.
JOHN: ( CONTINUED )
JOHN: A long-haired doctor, BECSEY, steps into his path.
DR. BECSEY: What's going on?!
JOHN: My wife attempted suicide.
JOHN: I have to see her!
DR. BECSEY: Why isn't she in the ER?
JOHN: Please. Two minutes.
DR. BECSEY: Two minutes.
JENNA: I'm sorry. He just keeps pretending he's asleep.
JOHN: ( reaching for his wallet ) Don't worry about it.
JENNA: It's okay.
JOHN: I insist. I kept you out on a school I'm not in school anymore.
JENNA: I'm not in school anymore.
JOHN: And give a big hug to Pengui, Little Pengui, Big Turtley, Little Turtley, Kiki and Opossumy. Lots and lots of love, Mommy. You gonna give them hugs from her? Should we write her back?
LUKE: .When is she coming home?
JOHN: Soon honey. Soon.
LUKE: ( thinks for a moment, then: ) Can I have a quarter?
JOHN: Can you have a quarter?
LUKE: Then can I have them all?
JOHN: He hands Luke the jar, and hoists up him and his animals.
JOHN: So, what is it about? Julie?
JULIE: That belief in someone's virtue is more important than virtue itself?
JOHN: No. I mean, yes, that's in there. But what is it about?
JOHN: It's a course that investigates what drives men to be free, no matter the Somebody else had dibs on Papillon?
DAMON: Somebody else had dibs on Papillon?
JOHN: You escaped from jail seven times.
TOUGH GUY: No smoking!!
DAMON: Yeah, who would want to cut short your precious life?
JOHN: Mind if I tape you?
DAMON: Go for it, it can't be used as evidence. What do you want to know?
JOHN: How you escaped when no one else Balls and a little luck. No prison in the world is airtight. Each one has a key. You have to find it.
DAMON: Balls and a little luck. No prison in the world is airtight. Each one has a key. You have to find it.
JOHN: How do you do that?
DAMON: A lot of looking. Especially at things that break the daily routine. Guards get comfortable doing the same thing every day. Something happens where they have to think, That's when they will make mistakes. But when you see it you have to be ready. You have to have the entire plan already in place before you even know how you are going to get out of the jail. Escaping is easy; the hardest part is staying free.
JOHN: The city.
DAMON: Where are you from?
JOHN: Pittsburgh is tough; so many bridges and tunnels they can block off.
DAMON: Pittsburgh is tough; so many bridges and tunnels they can block off.
JOHN: How can they be so exact?
DAMON: After 9-11 Homeland Security made every city have a lock-down plan downtown Pittsburgh, Philly, Boston, Minneapolis fifteen minutes. They can do DC in under ten.
DAMON: And be running rolling stops on the secondary roads. They won't have your photograph yet, but they will have your description.
JOHN: Thirty-five minutes isn't a lot of Then surrender.
DAMON: Then surrender.
DAMON: Forget the local airports. Leave from another state.
DAMON: Second: identity. It's easy to find fake papers, harder to find ones that will get you through an airport.
DAMON: If you have to rent a car, find a place that will take a cash deposit. They'll still run a credit check, so use a real person's name on the ID. Third: destination.
DAMON: Then money.
JOHN: How much?
DAMON: Enough to last at least five-six years. Run out of money and you run out of friends.
DAMON: But before you do anything, you have to ask yourself if you can do it. Can you forget about ever seeing your parents again. Can you kill a guard, leave your kid at a gas station, push a nice old lady to the ground because she is between you and the door? Because to do this thing, that's who you have to become. And if you can't, don't start, because you'll just get someone killed.
DAMON: I gave myself up. I couldn't take wondering when someone was going to come through the bedroom door. Got what you need?
JOHN: What do you have in your pocket?
DAMON: What do you have in your pocket?
LUKE: It was already tied.
WOMAN'S VOICE: Mr. Brennan?
DR. LIFSON: We met briefly. Byrdie Lifson.
JOHN: Oh, sorry. Hello, Doctor.
DR. LIFSON: ( to approaching guard ) I'll bring them back myself.
DR. LIFSON: We check your wife's blood regularly. She's been refusing her insulin. I don't want to sound dramatic, but it's just another form of suicide.
JOHN: I'll talk to her.
DR. LIFSON: If she doesn't
JOHN: I'll talk to her. Let's go, Squirrel.
JOHN: Hey. Are you alright?
LARA: I'm fine. I'm fine.
JOHN: The doctor told me about the insulin.
LARA: ( watching Luke ) Yeah, I forgot. It's no big deal.
JOHN: You forgot? For how many days?
LARA: I forgot, okay? I have things on my And so much to do.
JOHN: And so much to do.
LARA: Oh, that's nice.
JOHN: Why are you doing this?
LARA: Can I please just watch him play? Tell me about kindergarten.
JOHN: No. I need you to
LARA: Fine, I won't forget again, okay? I am just never going to walk him to school or wash his clothes or make him dinner.and I don't know how I can live knowing that. Okay?
JOHN: Lara. Look at me. Something will happen. I promise.
LARA: ( cruelly - but hushed ) What? What is going to happen? There are no more appeals, there are no more anything. Exactly what miracle are we hoping for, John?
JOHN: Stop bringing him.
LARA: Stop bringing him.
JOHN: Come on.
LARA: He hates coming here. Look at him.
JOHN: Please. It's not his fault. It's too hard to watch him forget me.
LARA: Please. It's not his fault. It's too hard to watch him forget me.
JOHN: Yes. Anything.
LARA: My mother tried to send me anti-aging
EUGENIE: You're sure that you don't want a lawn sign?
JOHN: I'm very sure. Thanks.
COPTER PILOT: On the left, Allegheny County Jail. Built in 1995, it is now the largest jail in the world. There have been three escape attempts. No one's made it out alive. On your right.
LYLA: On the first landing, which was as small as the necessary turn of the stairs allowed, there was a niche in the column, about a yard wide, and in this niche the prince felt convinced that a man stood concealed. He thought he could distinguish a figure standing there.
JOHN: George nods, takes Luke's hand and walks to the kitchen.
JOHN: Ten apiece, five for forty.
MOUSS: Ten apiece, five for forty.

HARV: He did, did he? What do you want?
JOHN: Three passports, a driver's license, and real social security number.
HARV: How do you know Mouss?
JOHN: He babysits my kid.
HARV: ( sizes him up, then: )
HARV: You have the photos on you?
JOHN: Yes. How much?
HARV: Fifteen hundred.
MOUSS: I ever see you again, you lose an
EUGENIE: You did remember I was showing the Give me two minutes.
JOHN: Give me two minutes.
EUGENIE: It really is a great neighborhood.
GRACE: Oh, my lord! What happened?
JOHN: It was stupid, I fell off the bike.
GRACE: The bike that's been in our garage for two years? Put your head back.
JOHN: Some guy made a crack about Lara.
GRACE: So, that's what you do now: punch everyone who thinks she's guilty?
JOHN: What's that supposed to mean?
GRACE: It means it's important what YOU believe, not
JOHN: Really? So, what do you believe,
GRACE: Why are you trying to start a fight?
JOHN: ( calling out back door ) Come on, buddy! ( to his mother ) Where is his bag?
GRACE: Why are you doing this?!
JOHN: No reason. I just stupidly thought people who loved her would actually believe she's innocent. My mistake.
GRACE: Stop this!
JOHN: ( to Luke ) Give Grandma a kiss.
LUKE: Does your face hurt?
JOHN: A little.
LUKE: Did you hit him back?
JOHN: That's okay.
LUKE: That's okay.
JOHN: Mike speaks in a loud, atonal and unnerving voice.
MIKE: I was at the bar. I know what you are looking for.
MIKE: What do you need?
JOHN: Three passports, a driver's license and social security number that can take a credit check.
MIKE: Thirty seven hundred.
JOHN: That's too much.
MIKE: It is if you never get them. I need photos and a thousand in advance.
MIKE: I'll bring them Wednesday.
JOHN: Not here. Don't come here again.
MIKE: Parking lot of Don's. Eckert Street. Under the bridge; two o'clock. If I'm not there on time, leave.
JOHN: Show me how to load it.
JOHN: No video game.
JOHN: I'll play checkers with you after You'll just lose again.
JOHN: ( buoyed/to Luke ) Not tonight. Tonight, I utterly destroy you.
NOTARY: Mr. Brennan?
NOTARY: And just put your thumb there.
JOHN: I'll just be a moment.
LARA: ( touching him, melting ) Your poor face. How could you do that to yourself?
JOHN: I am useless without you. I can't even ride a bike.
LARA: I think it's very sexy.
JOHN: I'm sorry we had to do this.
LARA: You have nothing to apologize for. But you should have told me before I know.
JOHN: I know.
LARA: I don't want you not telling me From now on I will.
JOHN: From now on I will.
LARA: ( beat ) I won't know where to picture you. ( off his look ) I close my eyes and I see Luke in his bedroom, you on the sofa by the Window. I won't know where to picture you anymore.
JOHN: ( CONTINUED )
PAULA: I was wondering if I could ask you to water my plants next week; I'm going in for an operation.
JOHN: I hope it's nothing serious.
PAULA: My idiot doctor misdiagnosed me. He's blaming the lab; the lab's blaming him. But I'll be fine.
JOHN: Hi. It's John. Luke isn't feeling well, I'm going to take him home. I need Carl to cover my 2:30 class.
MIKE: You were supposed to leave.
JOHN: I need them.
MIKE: You notice that guy was a cop?
JOHN: Which guy?
MIKE: The one with the red light in his back window.
JOHN: How are you doing today?
GUARD: Don't touch that.
JOHN: John puts the dish down, and we see the bump key is gone John palmed it. The guard dumps John's key ring on the counter with the keys and cell phones from the other visitors. JOHN pockets the palmed key as he enters the jail.
MAJOR: So, you are where in here?
JOHN: .In the middle there.
MAJOR: In the middle. Can you point to It's hard to tell. I think that's me there. Why? So that's not you there. By the I was over here. You want to tell me what's going on?

MAJOR: You want me to tell you?
JOHN: The Major holds the piece of the key that jammed in the lock.
MAJOR: You know what a bump key is?
JOHN: Major puts it on the desk and just stares at John. Finally:
MAJOR: If this was you, you might want to think about what's going to happen to your kids if both of their parents are in prison.
DETECTIVE COLLERO: The worst date you've ever been on? This was worse. And this guy? He really thinks he is doing great. Then he's driving me home and I know he's going to try and kiss me, so I pretend to fall asleep. I mean, I'm actually snoring, right in his car. Does that stop him?
DETECTIVE QUINN: Did I tell you not to date cops?
MALE NEIGHBOR: What's your problem? He's not home!
MICK: Not home? So you're saying I'm blind?
MALE NEIGHBOR: No, I'm saying you're an idiot.
MICK: You know what? You're right. I am an idiot.
LUKE: Can I have my cookies?
JOHN: You hungry? You want your sandwich?
LUKE: John hands him two packaged cookies. Luke runs off and hands them to Carrie. Her attractive young mother, Nicole, sitting a couple of benches down, calls and draws John's attention.
NICOLE: ( to John ) I'm sorry. She just already has it all figured out. ( John nods awkwardly ) I remember.
JOHN: I remember.
NICOLE: ( knows he doesn't ) ( smiles and admits ) I remember your daughter.
JOHN: ( smiles and admits ) I remember your daughter.
NICOLE: She's hard to forget. Oh, this is for you. Luke was supposed to bring it home.

JOHN: You want to read a letter from Mom?
LUKE: She didn't write that.
JOHN: My mistake. Dearest Luke, who I love so, so much. I wish I could have walked you home today, it was so beautiful out.
LUKE: But what's wrong with her?
JOHN: She's not feeling well.
LUKE: Why didn't she just stay home?

JOHN: Is it Luke?
LARA: Is it Luke?
JOHN: No. He's fine. I had Meyer see what he could do about not getting you moved.
LARA: You haven't? YOU haven't? God, John, you are too much. Luke is having a 'hard time' because mommy is in jail for murder, not because daddy doesn't spend enough time with him! Your father was right, you don't live in the same world we do.
JOHN: ( stung ) That's nice, that the two of you talk. What world do I live in, Lara?

LARA: Nothing. You're too perfect already. You know you never even asked me if I did it. If I killed her.

JOHN: No. It was.
ALEX: ( suddenly desperate ) My kid is upstairs!!
JOHN: MY KID!!
ALEX: MY KID!!
MY KID!!: Without warning, Alex dashes for the front hall. Stunned, John doesn't shoot. He grabs David by the hair, sticks the gun in his temple and shoves him into the front hall.
DAVID: Let me go!!
JOHN: Get up there!!
DAVID: The house is going to explode!
JOHN: Is anyone up here?!
DAVID: Don't leave me. I don't want to burn. Don't let me burn.

SUV - ZOO PARKING LOT EXIT CONTINUOUS 311 John drifts up to the stop sign at the intersection. A sign points out the interstate to the left and he can see the overpass and freeway entrance; the business district to the right. He checks his watch: 48 minutes. He resets it to zero. Game over.

LUKE: I think we're going to the cottage.
LARA: He nods knowingly.
LUKE: I have money.
LARA: Good. Then I'll stick close to you.
LUKE: John finds the news station.
