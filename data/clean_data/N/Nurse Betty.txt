LONNIE: Even if he's falling asleep on his feet?
BLAKE: Lonnie, it's a complex procedure. Why don't you observe?

BETTY: Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style!
SUE ANN: Oh, Betty
BETTY: I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
SUE ANN: Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.

BETTY: It's all right.
SUE ANN: You sure? Maybe next week we could.

SUE ANN: ( BEAT ) So what color is it?
BETTY: SUE ANN
SUE ANN: The LeSabre!

SUE ANN: Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday.
BETTY: I gotta go make dinner.
BETTY: Sure you don't want any salad?
DEL: No, I do not want any goddamn. what was all that shit on the phone about the new I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but.

BETTY: . like the water purifiers?
DEL: Or the vitamins? Or the.? Hey, the FDA screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it!
BETTY: Or the vitamins? Or the.? Hey, the FDA screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it!
DEL: Hey, the FDA screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it!
BETTY: I got you, Del.
DEL: . well, then you ain't got much.
BETTY: Oh, I know.
DEL: Couple 'a guys in from outta town. They want to see the new LeSabres.
BETTY: Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
DEL: They're new to us. Jesus. you know these actors are mainly models, which are mainly fags. They've done studies. The rest're assholes. But you know what bugs me most about these It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
BETTY: Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
DEL: That is a skill! Daddy's here, babies. daddy's here. Be back later. clean up.
BETTY: What the hell am I doing?
CLOSE ON: a traditional greeting from her grandparents. Red hearts and lace. A color photo of them enclosed. Betty smiles at this. After moment, she quietly sings a quick refrain of "Happy Birthday" to herself.
LONNIE: Tell me something good, Sugar.
CHLOE: We're all set. I told him my car's in the shop. He said he'd be happy to give me a ride home.
LONNIE: ( V.O. ) You're beautiful.
CHLOE: Tell me something I don't know.
CHLOE: Thanks for pulling over, David. I can't go that fast without taking a breather.
DAVID: Sorry. it's nice to see what this little beauty can do, though. I guess, somehow, all that speed helps me forget the past.
CHLOE: I'm sure it does. Mmm, leather. How far do they recline? Listen, David, I know I've said it before, but I want to tell you again how sorry I am about your wife.
BETTY: She hits PAUSE and crosses to look out.
DEL: . you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em.
CHARLIE: You're a hundred percent right. They rely on what's-his-name's arm too much.
DEL: Now, what can I get you gentlemen to
CHARLIE: Bourbon, little water, thank you.
WESLEY: Beer, please.
DEL: You got it.
WESLEY: Hey. you got a fine one right here!
CHARLIE: ( to Del ) Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?
DEL: If you ate at the Tip Top you did.
CHARLIE: Oh, yes, with the coffee.
DEL: Yep, Betty pours a pretty mean cup.
CHARLIE: I like this. I like doing business in the home. It's cozy. Who's birthday?
DEL: Ahh. my wife's.
WESLEY: What'd you get her?
DEL: Huh? Oh, umm, a car.
DAVID: I'm sorry, Chloe. It's not that I don't find you attractive. I'm just not ready.
DEL: All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.
CHARLIE: If we're for real?
DEL: You don't exactly look like drug dealers.
WESLEY: Isn't that the point?
DEL: Yeah, well, I don't have time to screw around. I got buyers in Dallas, Houston and Vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up.
CHARLIE: We appreciate that. But you just poured me a drink, I'd like to enjoy your hospitality for a few minutes.
DEL: Fine. You got five.
CHARLIE: It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?
DEL: ( laughs ) Are you kidding me? What's to like?
WESLEY: Seems like a nice place.
DEL: It is, if you like idiots.
CHARLIE: What do you mean?
DEL: It's a small town, man. I never should have left Omaha. People here think
WESLEY: You better believe it.
DEL: You better believe it.
CHARLIE: Could you give us an example?
DEL: Of what?
CHARLIE: I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
DEL: I don't follow.
CHARLIE: You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
DEL: ( warily ) I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
CHARLIE: I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
DEL: Are we gonna do business here, or not?
WESLEY: Relax, we brought the cash.
CHARLIE: I'm just curious. Can't you give me an All right . lemme see . okay, new Burger King opens up. These assholes get excited and start lining up. Like it's some five star restaurant. The place is mobbed. Right?
DEL: ( annoyed ) All right . lemme see . okay, new Burger King opens up. These assholes get excited and start lining up. Like it's some five star restaurant. The place is mobbed. Right?
CHARLIE: Hmmmm. "Five Stars," huh?
WESLEY: No, that's ignorant. They just don't know any better.
CHARLIE: That's what I thought. You better give me another example.
DEL: This is bullshit, can we get down to business here, please?
WESLEY: He's waiting.
DEL: Okay, uh. the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
WESLEY: You did not just say "Injuns," Del.
CHARLIE: You did not just say "Injuns," Del.
DEL: The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
CHARLIE: Like what?
DEL: Driving their cars into trees. puking on the sidewalk. stupid shit!
CHARLIE: Let's see. around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not I. I don't know.
DEL: I. I don't know.
CHARLIE: Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.
DEL: My socks?
WESLEY: You heard the man. I'm gonna talk to you and when I'm finished, you can answer. But I don't like being interrupted. Now roll them into a ball.
CHARLIE: I'm gonna talk to you and when I'm finished, you can answer. But I don't like being interrupted. Now roll them into a ball.
DEL: Oh, Jesus, please. Please, God.
CHARLIE: . and put them in your mouth.
DAVID: ( V.O. ) You're wonderful, Chloe, you are. But I just know there's something special out there for me.
CHARLIE: Now I'm gonna tell you what stupid is. Stupid is taking something that doesn't belong to you. Right Wesley?
WESLEY: That's right.
CHARLIE: Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, That is so right.
WESLEY: That is so right.
CHARLIE: Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
WESLEY: Now, that's really stupid.
CHARLIE: So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we? Good. Now we're getting somewhere. You agree that you were stupid? You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is - you'd have been scalped.
WESLEY: Hell of a way to die.
CHARLIE: It wasn't always fatal, Wesley. We could scalp Del right now, and he'd be plenty alive to tell us how it feels.
WESLEY: A mark, huh? Shut the fuck up! I bleed more than that when I shave.
CHARLIE: Now. I want to know the particulars of your stupid act: how you got what doesn't belong to you, who helped you get it, and of course, where it is now.
DEL: It's in the Buick! I swear to God it's all there!
DAVID: You wanted to see me, Blake?
BLAKE: I wish I could say I had good news. David, I'll get right to the point. Chloe Jensen has filed charges of sexual
DEL: I got it from a truck driver named Duane Cooley, out of Amarillo. He brings my cars down from Detroit. But I haven't touched it, I swear to you. Please! Please! Please!
CHARLIE: Consider yourself lucky. Luckier than those 'Injuns' you have such contempt I'll tell you, if anyone got a raw deal it's the American Indian. This country has a black mark on its soul for what was done to them. I'm all for them owning casinos, getting rich off the white man's greed. It's a beautiful piece of irony, isn't it, IT SURE IS!!
WESLEY: IT SURE IS!!
CHARLIE: JESUS CHRIST!!! What the fuck is the matter with you?!
JESUS CHRIST!!!: Wesley steps back, staring at the dripping scalp in his hand, as if wondering how it got there. Betty is transfixed, Charlie re-enters. The two men look at each other over Del's MUFFLED SCREAMS as he plows headlong into wooden paneling, a china cabinet, and finally, back toward them near the breakfast counter. Del bashes blindly into it. Wesley is practically foaming at the mouth, still rushing on what he did. Charlie draws a silenced pistol and mercifully SHOOTS Del through the head. The big man stops suddenly, blinks once or twice, topples over.
CHARLIE: Are you out of your mind? You scalped You told me how to do it!
WESLEY: You told me how to do it!
CHARLIE: That was to get him to talk!
WESLEY: He told us it's in the Buick.
CHARLIE: We don't know which Buick, do we?
WESLEY: Well, why'd you shoot him?
CHARLIE: I had to shoot him! It was the only decent thing to do. This is very unprofessional, Wesley.
SUE ANN: ( O.S. ) Happy Birthday to you! Happy Birthday to you! Happy Birthday, dear
ON BETTY: As she hits 'Play':
DAVID: . you're wonderful, Chloe, you are. But I just know there's something special out there for me.
DEPUTY: Hang on there, Roy. Nobody comes in.
ROY: Elden called me. He wants to, ahh, make a statement for the paper.
ROY: Hey, Betty. Are you okay?
BETTY: I'm great, good, content. What happened to your arm, Roy?
ROY: Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few.
BETTY: Make sure it's elevated.
ROY: You want me to make you a sling? It's no What're you doing here, Roy?
BETTY: You want me to make you a sling? It's no What're you doing here, Roy?
ROY: Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright. and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened.
BETTY: Oh, that. Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
ROY: My God. did you get a look at who did You did? Was it anyone that you.?
BETTY: You did? Was it anyone that you.?
ROY: You did? Was it anyone that you.?
BETTY: It was Chloe.
BALLARD: Hey, you guys wanna try not stepping directly in the evidence, please? Ostrey, you and your goddamn police scanner! I leave for ten minutes and. Betty, I'm sorry about this.
BETTY: 'Night, guys.
BALLARD: Okay, let's go. I got nothing for the record yet.
ROY: Oww! My arm, careful!
BALLARD: Ahh, what'd you do now. fall off your bike again?
ROY: No, it's nothing, I. my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
BALLARD: Good God.they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there!
ROY: I can't.they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was.
BALLARD: .you are so goddamn weird.
ROY: No, Elden, I need to.
BALLARD: You need to get yourself gone from my crime scene. And leave Betty alone, She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it was a woman.
ROY: She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it was a woman.
BALLARD: It wasn't a woman.
ROY: Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe.
BALLARD: I'm tellin' you it wasn't no woman, Roy!
ROY: You think a woman did that?!
BALLARD: You think a woman did that?!
BALLARD: Kinda' looks like a burnt out roman candle, don't he?
ROY: So, you think you're gonna find his scalp hanging in some tepee?
BALLARD: They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
ROY: Did you send anyone out there?
BALLARD: You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
ROY: Bad idea .
BALLARD: You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work.
ROY: You better handle what's in this garbage can first.
WESLEY: I still don't understand how you knew Del was telling the truth.
CHARLIE: I saw his soul Wesley. He was face to face with his God, and no one lies in that situation. But your Geronimo act rattled me, and I abandoned my instincts.
WESLEY: I didn't. You gave me a look!
CHARLIE: What 'look'?
WESLEY: That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out.
CHARLIE: I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked, did I tell you that?
WESLEY: Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian What the hell does that mean? If I'd told a Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat? It's not here. Let's go.
CHARLIE: What the hell does that mean? If I'd told a Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat? It's not here. Let's go.
WESLEY: You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
CHARLIE: Why not, it'll confuse 'em. gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
WESLEY: I wanted to make a statement.
CHARLIE: Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good - not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.
WESLEY: . that's a good motto.
CHARLIE: Fine, I'll get you a bumpersticker, but you better start believing it! It's the only statement you need to make.
DOCTOR: And did your husband know these people?
BETTY: Sort of.but he ignored them.
DOCTOR: And how did that make you feel, Betty?
BETTY: I felt all cold inside. And angry.
BALLARD: I questioned Joyce about all this.
ROY: Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my . and half the other guys in this town. Including you, I believe.
BALLARD: Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my . and half the other guys in this town. Including you, I believe.
ROY: . and half the other guys in this town. Including you, I believe.
BALLARD: Junior year!
ROY: Anyway, so what?
BALLARD: So? . Suppose Betty found out about You said a woman couldn't have done it.
ROY: You said a woman couldn't have done it.
BALLARD: A woman can write a check.
ROY: So you're saying Betty Sizemore - our Betty Sizemorewho you were in swing choir withhas now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched? You're amazing.
BALLARD: 'S just a theory.just 'cause I'm thinking it don't mean I like it. How is she?
DOCTOR: She's in a kind of shock. I see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms.
BALLARD: Could I have that in American?
DOCTOR: It's a type of altered state.it allows a traumatized person to continue So she did witness it?
BALLARD: So she did witness it?
ROY: Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.
BALLARD: That's it! YOU'RE GONE!
ROY: Oww, the arm, the arm!
BALLARD: You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!
ROY: One question, Doctor, please! ( outside the door ) You can't do this! I'm the press, I have rights!!
BALLARD: That's right, you have the right to remain silent. Sorry you had to see that. You were I was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the time being. I also think you ought to have her
DOCTOR: I was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the time being. I also think you ought to have her
BALLARD: No. Friends from the diner maybe?
DOCTOR: Well, you should find out. She keeps talking about them.
SUE ANN: Let me know if you need anything, okay?
BETTY: Are you and Larry happy?
SUE ANN: Oh, I dunno. enough, I s'pose.
BETTY: Then you should treasure that. you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
SUE ANN: All you been through. I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
BETTY: All the time.
SUE ANN: Well, you are.
BETTY: Something bad happened to Del and me, didn't it?
SUE ANN: Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
BETTY: Sue Ann, I'm sorry about all this, but I just know there's something special out there for me.
LATER: The Mickey Mouse clock on the wall reads 3:30. Beneath it, Betty is sitting up in bed, wide awake.
WESLEY: So you got Asian women?
DUANE: ( Southern accent ) Sure, I got Asian. Got black, white, any color you like, video and magazine. Got fat chicks and animals too, if you want 'em. They're extra.
CHARLIE: Mmmm. Well, it was a piece of luck running into you, Duane. I thought I was
WESLEY: I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together.
DUANE: That's nicely put. You outta get yourself to Thailand.
CHARLIE: What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?
DUANE: Georgia. In case I didn't tell you, it's cash only, gentlemen.
WESLEY: We can live with that.
CHARLIE: I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.
DUANE: Here's Ghengis Kunt and The Demilitarized Zone. Get it? They're Korean, so they're pretty hot.
CHARLIE: You know, it's interesting. The South lost the Civil War, but they still seem to get all the glory.
DUANE: Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis - they're all losers in my book.
CHARLIE: Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis - they're all losers in my book.
DUANE: The fuck you talking about?
CHARLIE: Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
DUANE: ( to Wesley ) He goin' crazy on us, or what?
CHARLIE: Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
DUANE: Really. And where was that, old man?
CHARLIE: ( BEAT ) They did horrible things to men there.
LONNIE: I think you better tell me what's going on here, Chloe.
CHLOE: I just feel. funny about what we did.
LONNIE: ( laughs ) You feel guilty? Let me remind you of something, sweetheart. You're in this up to those fabulous eyes of yours.
CHARLIE: . So, at a rest stop outside Logansport you noticed that two guys were slipping something extra in one of your cars, and you decided to see what it was. Then you figured you'd take this valuable commodity and go into business yourself, even though it didn't belong to you. But you needed a crackerjack salesman to move it, so you made the biggest mistake of your short life and chose Del. Sound right so far? Del's dead, by the way. I sent him to the Great Beyond.
WESLEY: Actually, I scalped him, and then you killed him.
CHARLIE: ( BEAT ) Now, the one thing I don't get is that we checked all the Buicks on that lot. Four '97 LeSabres and nothing in 'em.
WESLEY: Should I kill him now?
CHARLIE: Wait. Any last words, General Lee?
DUANE: Suck my dick, you Yankee piece of shit.
CHARLIE: God, I admire that. Ya see that, Wesley? That's why they get all the glory.
WESLEY: .why'd you spit on me?
CHARLIE: Come on, Wesley, three shots.
WESLEY: Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
CHARLIE: You have to rise above it. The professionals rise above that kind of

ROY: That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
BALLARD: I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this.
WESLEY: So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks?
CHARLIE: We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size.

CHARLIE: . and how long did she work here?
DARLENE: Oh, five years, give or take.
CHARLIE: Hmm. you two in high school together?

WESLEY: Did you say LeSabre?
JOYCE: Look, she didn't kill Del over no car if that's what you're thinking.
WESLEY: But she could have taken one, right?
JOYCE: Maybe, but I don't think she had the nerve. I know her. And I'm a pretty good judge of character.
WESLEY: . yeah, I can see that.
BETTY: Would you mind very much if I changed the channel at three o'clock?
MERLE: He BURPS, then finally looks at her with bleary eyes.
BETTY: Please? It's very important to me. "A Reason to Love" comes on at three around I'll give you money.
MERLE: ARE YOU DEAF?!! Please keep it down, it's time for "A Reason to Love."
BETTY: That's real funny. Why don't you have another drink?
ELLEN: What's the matter here?
BETTY: I begged him to let me put that on!
ELLEN: He's a prick. Merle?. You're a prick.
BETTY: Hi, I'm Betty. I'll take a Miller, if you got it.
CHLOE: Lonnie? It's Chloe. We need to talk . I don't think I can go through with this.
BETTY: Do you have a phone?
ELLEN: If it's long distance you can leave me a buck when you're done.
BETTY: Sue Ann? It's Betty. I just wanted to let you know I'm okay . Huh? I'm at the Canyon Ranch Bar in .
MERLE: Shut up, Merle. Williams.
ELLEN: Shut up, Merle. Williams.

LONNIE: Yeah. Women are an unsolved mystery.
ELLEN: Where you headed, Betty?
BETTY: Los Angeles, California.
ELLEN: And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go? When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.
BETTY: Europe? The Europe? This is my first time out of Kansas.
ELLEN: I should call you Dorothy.
BETTY: Did you love it?
ELLEN: Sure I loved it! It was great.
BETTY: That's horrible!
ELLEN: No, he was a toad. Even more of a toad than Merle. I just wear the ring to keep the flies away. Rome was the best thing I ever did, because I DID IT! And I swear to you, it changed me. I've been to Rome, Italy! I sat every morning at the Cafe Sistina and had my cappuccino, and watched the pilgrims walk to mass, and no one can ever take that away from
BETTY: I left my husband two days ago.
ELLEN: I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas.
BETTY: I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas.
ELLEN: Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas.
BETTY: Oh. I mean, except for that.
ELLEN: Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
BETTY: No. Loma Vista.
ELLEN: ( laughs ) I s'pose his name's David Ravell.
BETTY: ( truly shocked ) How did you know?
ELLEN: What's his real name?
BETTY: Dr. David Ravell.
ELLEN: You mean. George McCord, the actor?
BETTY: No, I mean David Ravell. He's a surgeon.
ELLEN: Yeah, I know, we just watched him together, remember? Up there on the TV. Good God Almighty . You're serious. I've heard about people like you.
BETTY: I'll go to the Hospital.
ELLEN: What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
BETTY: Like Rome?
ELLEN: You made out alright.
BETTY: You made out alright.
ELLEN: Yeah, but at least I knew Rome was gonna be there when I arrived.
BETTY: Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've ever done, but I've gotta do it.
ELLEN: You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you.
BETTY: To tell you the truth, I can't believe I've made it this far. It may not be Europe, but I just know there's something special out there for me.
MERLE: What planet is she from?
CHARLIE: So she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day.
WESLEY: You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
CHARLIE: Joyce was screwing Del.
WESLEY: . among others.
CHARLIE: I'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?
WESLEY: Yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. She's an amateur, just like Del was.
CHARLIE: ( into phone ) Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
CHARLIE: Sorry, you've got the wrong number.
WESLEY: A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
CHARLIE: You should read more. Listen to me. I think this woman was waiting for a chance to do this, and we gave it to her. She kept to herself for years, living with a pompous asshole. Then she sees her opportunity, and BOOM! - she leaves that little mudpatch in the dust. These heartlanders can't figure it out, 'cause that's not their sweet little Betty. Hah! We've been tracking her for, what, three days and I already understand her better'n most the people in that shitty little burg. Betty, Betty, Betty.
WESLEY: So what the fuck's a Finn?
CHARLIE: Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
WESLEY: Like. us?
CHARLIE: No,. like a worthy adversary, Wesley. Like a very worthy adversary.
BALLARD: What the hell do you want?. Hey, Sue Ann, what's up?
ROY: We think we know where Betty is.
BALLARD: Ah, shit. Do I have to hear this now?
SUE ANN: What's with the tupperware, Elden, did Meredith run outta baggies?
BALLARD: No reason to get a plate dirty.
ROY: I see you're sticking to the diet Betty put you on.

BALLARD: That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
ROY: Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona.
BALLARD: She said she was in Arizona, did she?
BALLARD: You people are even more stupid than I thought. The woman's on the run and she's gonna just phone in her location?
SUE ANN: Come on, Elden, she's not on the run. Couldn't you at least call the Los Angeles Police Department?
ROY: You gotta do that much.
BALLARD: Hey, I'm the law. I don't gotta do
ELIZABETH: This is Betty at twelve.
CHARLIE: Very graceful. Perfect form.
ELIZABETH: Betty was a lovely child.
JERROLD: And she always had such spirit! But, after her mother died.
WESLEY: Would you say she was ambitious?
JERROLD: Oh, there's no tellin' what that girl could've accomplished, and she never had it easy. Never really had a childhood. caring for her father, going to school.
CHARLIE: Wise beyond her years, I'm sure, and such poise, too. Very, very impressive.
WESLEY: Well, then, did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her I don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.
ELIZABETH: I don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.
CHARLIE: What do you mean?
ELIZABETH: If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.
CHARLIE: ( taking her hand ) Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore.
JERROLD: You've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone. That's not our . why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill Because it ain't natural, young man.
WESLEY: ( defensive ) . why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill Because it ain't natural, young man.

CHARLIE: ( covering ) My partner's still young, Mr. Blaine, and he loves his job. ( laughs ) He'd like to kill all the criminals ( BEAT ) Now, if Betty was running from someone, where do you think she'd go?
AFTERNOON: Betty drives through Boyle Heights - East L.A., holding a map and checking street signs. She is wearing a brand new Nurse's uniform. Up ahead, she sees the hillside complex of L.A. County/USC Hospital. Hurriedly, she pulls over and checks herself in the visor mirror. She is underwhelmed.
BETTY: God. I still look like a waitress.
CHIEF NURSE: Of course, I don't know every doctor who works here.
BETTY: Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but It's not true. He was set up.
CHIEF NURSE: Well, I certainly would have heard about Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma . I don't think I know that hospital.

ROSA: SOMEBODY HELP US! PLEASE, SOMEBODY!
DOCTOR #1: Forget it! He doesn't have a chance. Help us over here.
ROSA: Betty hesitates, then checks his pulse - he has none. She peels back the bandages over a huge chest wound.

ROSA: You're hurting him!!
BETTY: I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!! LISTEN TO ME! IF I DON'T DO THIS, HE'S

ROSA: Is he gonna live?
DOCTOR: He's got a chance. Thanks to what that nurse did.
ADMINISTRATOR: ( to Chief Nurse ) Harriet? Who is that remarkable nurse?
CHIEF NURSE: That's Betty Sagamore. I hired her
BETTY: May I have my key, please?
WESLEY: Thas' it, thas' it. conquer that bitch.
CHARLIE: It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here. My Houston contact has always been very reliable.
WESLEY: And then we're gonna do her right here. You're always so coarse. "Do her right here." Let's just see what happens, "I wish that I could find a way; To speak my thoughts on Mother's Day. There are no words that quite express; My gratitude or happiness. A pleasant smile perhaps a kiss; I would not fail to give her this. I'd make her glad the whole day through; By sayin' 'Mother', I love you!' P.S. I wish I could say this to my mother's face, but I can't anymore." Who are you?! What the. Who the hell is this?
CHARLIE: You're always so coarse. "Do her right here." Let's just see what happens, "I wish that I could find a way; To speak my thoughts on Mother's Day.

MAN #1: Easy, Charlie! She's exactly who you said you were looking for.
CHARLIE: Wait, wait a minute. We have a major miscommunication here. This not Betty. This is not even close to Betty.
WOMAN: What the fuck're you talking about? My name's Betty.
CHARLIE: Then I'm sorry. Wrong Betty.
WESLEY: Let's get out of here. We got another long drive ahead of us.

CHIEF NURSE: What you did yesterday was reckless at best. You are not an employee of this hospital! If that boy dies I don't even want to think of the lawsuit that'll follow. Are we communicating here?
BETTY: Yes, ma'am.
CHIEF NURSE: Good. I'm prepared to offer you a job. You can help out in the pharmacy until your California certification and references arrive, but you are not to touch anyone. Is that totally clear?
CHIEF NURSE: ( cont'd ) ( studying Betty's uniform )

BETTY: Ummm.no, no. Different 'Ravell.' You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place.

BETTY: I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man.and David's still getting over Leslie. His wife.
ROSA: He has a wife?!
BETTY: Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
ROSA: God, that's awful!

ROSA: I was talking about what you could wear!
CHARLIE: See, in a LeSabre Betty's probably getting twenty-two, maybe twenty-five miles to the gallon, where we're topping out at fifteen.
WESLEY: What the hell's the matter with you?
CHARLIE: That was a really shitty thing to do.
WESLEY: I'm sick of looking at her mother-fucking
CHARLIE: Don't talk like that. She's my last one, Wesley, my final target. Don't you realize your special, that you represent something?

BETTY: If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
ROSA: IT'S NOT ABOUT GAS MONEY!! You have a thing for an actor on a stupid white soap opera, and we searched all over town for his character! Not the actor - whose name is George, by the way. His character!

ROY: Oww. Did you have to make these things so tight?
BALLARD: No, I didn't have to.
MERCEDES: Hey. Is Betty still trying to find that soap opera guy?
ROSA: Oh, yeah. Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air.
MERCEDES: Here's your needle. He's supposed to make an appearance here tonight.
BETTY: Don't worry, I'm looking. just taking a tiny break.
ROSA: This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid. So what do you say? Can we be friends?
BETTY: Rosa smiles and starts looking at the tickets in her hand.
ROSA: Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with.
BETTY: Rosa exits for a moment, then reappears in the doorway.
ROSA: .you hungry at all?

CHARLIE: What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We
WESLEY: I said, 'No.' N-O.
CHARLIE: "When I grow up I'm going to become a nurse or a veterinarian. I always want to help people and value all life, be it animal, plant or mineral." Does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you?
WESLEY: Do you hear yourself right now.? Like a fucking madman.
CHARLIE: Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
WESLEY: Yes, I am and we're not going. Act If you don't take the next turn for the canyon, I'm blowing my goddamn brains all over this car.
CHARLIE: If you don't take the next turn for the canyon, I'm blowing my goddamn brains all over this car.
ROSA: Betty stares at the car, unable to remember what it should mean. Then a MAN in a tuxedo gets out. Betty moves on.
BETTY: Looking for someone?
ROSA: You never know who you'll see. Look who's here! What are you waiting for? Talk to him! You came fifteen hundred miles for this.
GEORGE: Do I know you from.?
BETTY: .of course you do. You don't remember me?
GEORGE: I take it I should. I'm sorry.
BETTY: We were engaged.
LYLA: Oh good, another one.
GEORGE: I beg your pardon?
BETTY: But I'm the one who's sorry. Letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life. We were thirteen days away from getting married and . I just got scared. It's a mistake I've had to live with for six years. But it's behind me now. And I hope you can put it behind you. I've missed you. David.
GEORGE: That's very kind of you.
BETTY: The day I left you I just drove and drove. I drove all day and all that night, and I didn't go anywhere. I just kept driving. I stopped at a little country church, and the pastor let me in, and I sat

GEORGE: Right, Del. Del was one hot salesman. Of cars. He could talk anyone into You knew Del?!
BETTY: You knew Del?!
GEORGE: Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the time, but Del and I go way back. We went to school together. In fact, he saved my life. Two more minutes in that icy water and I would have drowned. But Del jumped in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch eventually, but I still owe him one.
BETTY: He never told me anything about.that's Funny, that's just what I was thinking.
LYLA: Funny, that's just what I was thinking.
GEORGE: I can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him.
BETTY: I'm so sorry. Life makes us do awful things sometimes.
GEORGE: I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But. Del?
BETTY: There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
GEORGE: You never gave us a chance.
BETTY: I know that. I can't tell you how many times I've said that to myself in those exact words.
GEORGE: Hey, don't. come on, I was just. you're not really crying, are you?. I was just playing along.
FRIEND #1: Now, look what you've done, George.
BETTY: Why do they keep calling you George?
GEORGE: I don't know. Why do you keep calling me Listen - David - It's getting late.
LYLA: Listen - David - It's getting late.
GEORGE: ( to Betty ) Right, uhh.I feel terrible about this, we have a prior engagement at another ( BEAT ) But. I'd be honored if you'd come.
LYLA: Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do.

WESLEY: SUE ANN ( V.O. )
WESLEY: SUE ANN ( V.O. )
WESLEY: ( recovering ) Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.
ON CHARLIE: walking toward the rail. As he nears her, they kiss. Suddenly, REPEATED BLASTS from the car horn. The image of Betty shudders, then blurs, then fades away entirely. Charlie rubs at his eyes tiredly, then slowly trudges back toward the car. Charlie returns and gets into the car. Silence. Wesley stares at him.
WESLEY: . you have a good time? You make a little wish?
CHARLIE: Where? Where is she?
WESLEY: I'm not telling.
CHARLIE: I'm not telling 'til you straighten up. You been acting like fucking Jerry Lewis on me and this shit's gotta stop or you can forget about your Betty. I mean it.

CHARLIE: Wesley, I'm fine. just tell me where she is.
FRIEND #2: I bought a car from Del, too. He sold me a lemon.
LYLA: Really? I put a hundred and thirty thousand miles on mine.
BETTY: Huh. I had no idea our little lot was so I never bought a car from Del. But I loved him. In my own way.
FRIEND #1: I never bought a car from Del. But I loved him. In my own way.
GEORGE: I guess we all did. ( to Betty ) You know, I didn't marry Leslie because I loved her. I married her to forget you.
BETTY: Oh, David.I'm sorry I caused you that much pain. Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
GEORGE: You're late, Eric.
ERIC: I know. Why are you guys leaving?
LYLA: We did our twenty minutes.

ERIC: Who the hell is this?
GEORGE: Sorry. She thinks you're someone else. I know exactly who you are!
BETTY: I know exactly who you are!
CHARLIE: This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.
WESLEY: Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!.
CHARLIE: Be careful with that!
ELLEN: What can I get you?
WESLEY: We're Federal Marshals, ma'am. We're looking for this young lady.

GEORGE: She's a good person to know.
BETTY: Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up.
GEORGE: Alright, okay. I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
BETTY: You told me that two hours ago. I haven't been this happy since I was twelve years old.
GEORGE: What happened when you were twelve?
BETTY: For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following Wow .

BALLARD: That's a nice name for what you need.
ROY: Come on, I have to get this dressing off.it itches! And what about my fish? Who is taking care of them?
BALLARD: Just shut up a second and listen. That, uh. that bar in Arizona? Where you said Betty was?

ROY: Little place called "Williams," why?
BALLARD: I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but. what else do you know?
ROY: I know plenty.
GEORGE: She makes me stretch! I got inside my character last night like I haven't done in six years on "Reason". It was a totally rejuvenating experience.
LYLA: I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.
GEORGE: She's even taken a job as a nurse!
LYLA: We know that.
GEORGE: Can I have an evil twin?
LYLA: No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?
GEORGE: Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?
LYLA: I don't know, George.
GEORGE: I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
LYLA: I'll think about it.
GEORGE: It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
LYLA: I said I'll think about it.
GEORGE: Fine, but promise me one thing. If we use her, I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery.
LYLA: Actually, she was my discovery. just like you.
GEORGE: "Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
LYLA: "Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
GEORGE: . yeah.
CHARLIE: So you believed the bartender. Why?
WESLEY: Well. I think I saw her soul.
CHARLIE: That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.
WESLEY: I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure.
CHARLIE: No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we.
WESLEY: Wait, wait, wait a minute. that doesn't make sense.
CHARLIE: What doesn't?
WESLEY: You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman.
CHARLIE: I never said that I believed.
WESLEY: No, you believed her, we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much. so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh?
CHARLIE: 'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how.
WESLEY: I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca.
CHARLIE: You need to remember who you're talking I need to get my goddamn head examined.
WESLEY: I need to get my goddamn head examined.
CHARLIE: "It's beneath her." She's a mother fucking housewife. nothing's beneath
WESLEY: "It's beneath her." She's a mother fucking housewife. nothing's beneath
CHARLIE: Boy, you need to get outta my face. now! You got a feeling, then you do what you gotta do, but don't you ever try to tell me my job. Not ever.

WESLEY: Oh fuck. Hey, can you sneak me on the lot?
GUARD: Wesley smiles and wanders off, headed toward a series of studio buildings in the distance. The guard watches him go.
CHARLIE: Betty Sizemore, she's got ten kilos. Blonde hair, a great figure. sort of a whole Doris Day thing going on. That's what I said Doris Day. You could see her working at the U.N., or something. 'The U.N.' "United Nations." Forget Nobody like that? You're sure? Yeah, Detroit by way of Kansas. Alright, let me know if you hear anything, okay?
BETTY: Are you sure I can borrow this?
ROSA: No, please. Go ahead, it's your Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
BETTY: Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?

BETTY: You should have a little faith in people.
ROSA: Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
BETTY: All the time. It's always "Loma Vista" this, "Loma Vista" that.
GEORGE: You must be Rosa. I've heard so much about you. I'm George McCord.
ROSA: Not as much as I've heard about you. She's a very nice girl and you better not hurt her.
GEORGE: Betty appears.
BETTY: Rosa, so you've met David?
ROSA: Sure did! And a funny thing, Betty, he introduced himself to me as George!
BETTY: Oh, he does that. It's this silly game he plays. Half the people who know him call him George.
GEORGE: I don't think your friend likes me.
BETTY: She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men.
GEORGE: Well, first I thought Patina, and then the Ivy, but then I thought of somewhere a little more romantic. Like my place.
GEORGE: God, I haven't felt like this since I was with Stella Adler in New York. You're
BETTY: You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.
GEORGE: Didn't I?
BETTY: No, I would have remembered that name. The only Stella I ever knew was a parrot.
GEORGE: I've never met anyone like you, Betty.
BETTY: I know, that's why we were meant to be No, I mean your dedication scares me.
GEORGE: No, I mean your dedication scares me.
BETTY: It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something.
GEORGE: Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now. the hours, the repetition. it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't .I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise. Let's talk about you.what do you think about me? I'm kidding. Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here.
BETTY: .but I love listening to you, so that's Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around.

BETTY: I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
GEORGE: Yes. maybe it was.
WESLEY: .so I'm standing there, minding my own business on Hollywood Blvd., checking out Gladys Knight's star-thing there, I look up at this little souvenir shop dude, Chinese dude, reading a paper. and who do I see? That's Lonnie. He's the show's Main Prick. And that is definitely Betty. Now, that ain't no coincidence.
CHARLIE: Who's this?
WESLEY: A doctor on the show. why? What in the. What the hell is this? You've been holding out on me. All this fucking It just didn't fit her profile.
CHARLIE: It just didn't fit her profile.
WESLEY: Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!
CHARLIE: She can't be here because of a. a soap opera. Not a soap opera. That'd make . crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind.
WESLEY: . crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind.
CHARLIE: . but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a.
WESLEY: I do not know how the fuck you lasted an hour in this job! Dragging our asses around with the answer to our prayers in your motherfucking jacket. a picture of that cunt right next to the.
CHARLIE: Don't Don't you talk about Betty like that. I don't care who she ends up being, you never use that word again. Got it?
WESLEY: Man, you have got to get some therapy.

VOICE: Slate it!
GEORGE: Just do what you've been doing. Watch the scene and on your cue take off from
VOICE: Chloe and Blake run through their lines lifelessly, then stop when they get to Betty's cue. Their faces loom around her menacingly. Staring. The lights are impossibly bright. People begin to shuffle and stare at one another. Lyla clears her throat as George bounds on stage, still smiling.
GEORGE: Are you all right?
CHLOE: Are you all right?
BLAKE: ( to Chloe ) I think you stepped on my first line.
CHLOE: . I was talking to her. Do you need anything.?

WESLEY: But you were right first. You gotta follow your instincts.
CHARLIE: What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
WESLEY: Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
CHARLIE: We could do that. I could be on my way to Florida, and you could go to Thailand and fuck your brains out.
WESLEY: .but that's not what we're gonna do, is No. if we don't finish this job, how are we gonna look at ourselves in the mirror? This is it for me, Wesley, she's the last one. My instinct says I gotta see this through with her, and if there's one thing I've tried to teach you here
CHARLIE: No. if we don't finish this job, how are we gonna look at ourselves in the mirror? This is it for me, Wesley, she's the last one. My instinct says I gotta see this through with her, and if there's one thing I've tried to teach you here
WESLEY: It's to follow my instincts. And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.
CHARLIE: No, I said to follow 'my' instincts. Now, we go up there and conclude our business. Case closed.
WESLEY: . oh, that's fucking democratic.
CHARLIE: I'm Detective Jefferson
ROSA: Oh. Did Betty call you? She's got problems, but she's no killer. I hope you guys can straighten this
ROSA: She's got problems, but she's no killer. I hope you guys can straighten this
CHARLIE: We'll do what we can. Where is she?
ROSA: ( to the men ) Please, go easy on her. She's had a really rough day. These guys are here to help you, Betty.
BETTY: I don't think so.
CHARLIE: We meet again. Not her mouth. I've spent many long hours in a car with your face staring back at me. I've seen it painted on the horizon.
WESLEY: ( to Charlie ) What's wrong with you?
ROSA: That's our pizza.
CHARLIE: Get rid of them. You understand?
ROY: Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!
BETTY: Roy! What are you doing here?
ROY: You're in serious danger!
BETTY: Ahh, look, right now's not very.
ROY: I woulda' been here sooner, but Ballard put me in jail. He still thinks you had Del scalped.
BALLARD: I never said that! Open the door, Betty.
BETTY: Sheriff, I don't.
BALLARD: C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some questions for you about.
ROY: Have you checked the trunk of that car you're driving, Betty? I think there might be.
BETTY: It's not really a good time, guys.
BALLARD: Don't give me that. I've come two thousand miles for this!
CHARLIE: Two thousand miles? That's nothing! Hah! You probably flew! I've crossed the river Styx looking for her, pal! I travelled the fucking country to be here! Who are these idiots?
BETTY: This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together.
CHARLIE: Oh, this is wonderful.
WESLEY: Come here. Your turn. I got two kids and a dog.
BALLARD: I got two kids and a dog.
WESLEY: Act professional, remember? What are you doing? No way! This is not professional!
BETTY: . I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
CHARLIE: No, just stand there. lemme look at you a minute. Do you know who I am?
BETTY: . I. I know what you are.
CHARLIE: Do you know why I'm here?
BETTY: I've got a pretty good idea. You're here to kill me, so kill me. You want me to be afraid, but I'm not. I don't care who you are, or why you two killed my
CHARLIE: You really. didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you?
BETTY: I have no idea what he was mixed up in. it was always something.
CHARLIE: So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify? Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
BETTY: Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against Damn, life is strange. I had you figured for this cold-blooded, calculating bitch Not that I didn't admire you for it.
CHARLIE: Damn, life is strange. I had you figured for this cold-blooded, calculating bitch Not that I didn't admire you for it.
BETTY: . well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here?
CHARLIE: . to see you.
BALLARD: You killed that bartender in Arizona and the trucker in Texas, didn't you?
WESLEY: How did you find Betty?
BALLARD: I just put it all together. I knew David, Lonnie and Chloe were from that show. Betty thinks they're real people. It sounded crazy, but it was worth a shot.
WESLEY: What do you want?!
ROY: That's a lie! I figured it out! I've been trying to tell this dumbass
BALLARD: Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
ROY: small-time, pissant, Barney Fife
WESLEY: SHUT UP! Shut the fuck up, both of you, before I kill you!
ROY: I'm the one who watched the show.I Did Chloe crack?
WESLEY: Did Chloe crack?
ROY: Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges.
WESLEY: Goddamn. how 'bout Jasmine?
ROY: She's a lesbian.
WESLEY: You lie, motherfucker.
ROY: I swear to God!
WESLEY: What?! You scream, you die.
ROSA: I have a tape of today's show.
CHARLIE: . I never meet people like you. I'm a garbageman of the human conditon. I deal with trash, mostly, people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives. But you. you're different.
BETTY: I am?
CHARLIE: Sure. You could probably have any thing you wanted. somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself, and you don't even realize it. I'm appreciably older than you, but my health is good. I take care of myself, and I got some money socked away. You'd never have to work agin, that's for sure. I'd treat you like a queen.
BETTY: Umm, I don't think that.
CHARLIE: Wait. Let me get this out. I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty-two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty-two pieces of shit, excuse my language.
BETTY: Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you. so, what do you You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
CHARLIE: Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you. so, what do you You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
BETTY: I don't feel that, no. I just..I'm not really who you think I am.
CHARLIE: No one is, honey. Here, listen to this. "If who I am and who I hope to be should meet one day, I know they will be friends." Now that's beautiful.
BETTY: I wrote that when I was twelve. where'd you get that?!
CHARLIE: ( he pulls out the diary ) I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I. I. it doesn't matter. Don't worry, they're fine. ( he gives the diary back ) Look, I used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea.
BETTY: I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.
CHARLIE: Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now.
WESLEY: . goddamn! What's your problem? You stupid piece of fuck!
CHARLIE: Charlie sees Wesley turn to him as Ballard FIRES again. Wesley's face explodes. The flying lead drives Charlie back to the bedroom. Crawling through the muck, Roy notices a fish flopping helplessly on the carpet inches from his face.
ROY: Those're Japanese koi!
ROSA: Yes! How'd you know that?
ROY: You gotta get 'em in water right away!
BALLARD: We're in a shootout, Roy! Shut up about the damn fish!
ROY: YOU shut up! They're beautiful, but get them some
CHARLIE: Oh, Christ, they shot my boy! How the hell did this happen? I'm in a goddamn shoot-out! Wesley? What the fuck happened out there?! That's my son! My son is dead!
BETTY: I'm sorry.
CHARLIE: You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE
HERE!: WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG! What do you want from me?
BETTY: WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG! What do you want from me?
CHARLIE: Oh shit.
BALLARD: ( checks his gun ) We need ammo. Go check his jacket, I'll cover you.
ROY: I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police.
BALLARD: You gotta go, we're pinned down!
ROSA: So why can't we just sneak outside? Huh?
BALLARD: Lady, you don't just run away from crime. besides, Betty's in there.
ROY: ( checking ) You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait.
BALLARD: No, no, no. you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best.
ROY: I've got the working gun, Elden, me! You wasted all your bullets so you crawl out
BALLARD: 146A OMIT 146A
CHARLIE: If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance.
BETTY: I better go check on them.
CHARLIE: Wait, Betty. you still haven't answered This is really awkward.
BETTY: This is really awkward.
CHARLIE: Ahh, it's too late, anyway. It's too Listen, I could shoot my way out, maybe take one of them with me. If you'd gimme my gun back.
BETTY: I'd rather not.
CHARLIE: Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
BETTY: .what're you saying?
CHARLIE: When a Roman general knew a battle was lost, he'd throw himself on his sword. Did. did you really come here because you love this guy?
BETTY: Yes. Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.
CHARLIE: So all this.really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
BETTY: I wouldn't have put it quite that way, Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted.
CHARLIE: Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted.
BETTY: I don't think I am.
CHARLIE: I want you to listen to me, Betty. People don't lie when they're about to You don't need that doctor. You don't need that actor. You don't need any man. It's not the forties, honey. You don't need anybody. You've got yourself. and that's more than most people can say.
ANCHORMAN: In a story that police say is bizarre, even for Hollywood, a father-son team of killers tracked a Kansas soap opera fan halfway across the country, only to find themselves the victims in a final, bloody
LYLA: This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months.
GEORGE: I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
LYLA: You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who.
GEORGE: What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who.
LYLA: Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day. I'm toying
GEORGE: That's not a bad idea. How many episodes before he comes back? Jesus, don't do that! If it gets around that you fired me, I'll never land a Then do as you're told. Get her back.
LYLA: Then do as you're told. Get her back.
GEORGE: I'm sorry for what I did. It was inexcusable. I'm sorry for the things I said, and for not respecting you, and for all the stupid things that.
DARLENE: When you have a minute.
GEORGE: Look, I don't really like the whole idea of autographs, and I'm kind of in the middle of.
DARLENE: Don't flatter yourself. It's the check.
GEORGE: Oh. Of course. sorry.
BETTY: ( grabbing it up ) My treat. You were saying. something about how stupid you've been?
GEORGE: Right. I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
BETTY: Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane.
GEORGE: I have. did it sound that bad?
BETTY: Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. . George. I do.
GEORGE: . George. I do.
BETTY: . George. I do.
GEORGE: . it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right
BETTY: . it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right
GEORGE: No, that's. okay. Fair enough.
BETTY: . there's always a chance, David.
DAVID: Right. But will there be a tomorrow, and the next day, and the next?
BETTY: ( whispering to him ) Doctor, if you were any handsomer it'd be a crime.
DAVID: I guess that means you're free tonight. Of course, it's up to you.
BETTY: No, it's up to us. I love you, David. And I want to see you tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day.
SUE ANN: That's my best friend!
BETTY: Could I get some service here, please?
