Ursula: Hi. Okay, will that be all?
Chandler: Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?
Joey: No, no... how come you are working here?
Chandler: Can we start over?
Ross: And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and peed all over the crossword.
Chandler: You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things?
Joey: Yeah.
All: Hey guys! Hey!
Joey: Hey Pheebs, guess who we saw today.
Phoebe: Ooh, ooh, fun! Okay... um, Liam Neeson.

Chandler: Your sister Ursula.
Phoebe: (Her face dropping) Oh, really.
Chandler: Yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh...
Phoebe: Hmmm? Yeah. So, um, is she fat?
Phoebe: (Turning to Chandler) where were you standing?
Rachel: So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?

Helen: (Over the intercom) Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.
Chandler: Oh, okay. Send her in.
Nina: Hi.
Chandler: Hi, Nina. Come on in.
Nina: You wanted to see me?
Nina: Which is bad, because?
Chandler: Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.
Nina: Your... excuse me?
Chandler: WENUS. (Coughs) Weekly Estimated Net...
Ross: Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote right now... Marce... you give Rossie the remote...
Monica: Great.
Rachel: (Looking at the television) Cool... "Urkel" in Spanish is "Urkel."
Ross: (looking at the remote) How did he do this?
Chandler: (Looking out at the balcony) So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
Chandler: Hey, where you been?
Chandler: Score.
Joey: She is so hot!
Chandler: Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by err... (he indicates Phoebe, who is helping Ross understand the remote control.)
Joey: Pheebs?
Phoebe: (Jumping up) Yeah?
Joey: You think it would be okay if I asked out your sister?
Joey: Cool, thanks.
Ross: You okay?
Ross: You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley?
Ross: Sorry.
Susan: I am supposed to be the mommy?
Ross: I see. So what do you propose to do?
Susan: I will flip you for it.
Ross: Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!
Susan: (Triumphantly) On your back... Mom.
Teacher: Alright, Mommies, take a nice deep cleansing breath.
Teacher: Good. Now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower.
Chandler: And?
Chandler: So what does this mean?
Chandler: Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very &ndash;
Chandler: Nina? Nina. (He goes around his desk to where she is sitting.) Nina. (In pain) Nina.
Nina: Are you okay?
Nina: (Taking her hand away) What?
Chandler: (Suddenly bright) Would you like to have dinner sometime?
Rachel: So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?
Phoebe: Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me.
Rachel: Okay... Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree and Evelyn?
Phoebe: Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.
Rachel: Ooh, okay... good.
Jamie: What is this place?
Jamie: I think we have an answer.
Jamie: It looks like her.
Jamie: Um, excuse me.
Phoebe: Yeah?
Phoebe: Much as you are.
Jamie: (Without moving her lips) Your turn.
Fran: Err... we know what we want.

Fran: And some biscottie cookies.
Phoebe: Good choice.
Jamie: Definitely her.
Fran: Yeah.
Joey: Hey.
Monica: Oh. Hi, Mr.Heckles.
Monica: (Closing the door) Goodbye Mr.Heckles.

Phoebe: Ohhh... Sure, yeah... (disgustedly dropping the cardigan back into the bag) ..okay, it fits.
Joey: Yep. Ice Capades.
Phoebe: That you like, (snappily confronting Joey over the heads of the knitting circle) we get it. You like her. Great!
Joey: Hey, Phoebe, I asked you, and you said it was okay.
Phoebe: Okay.
Chandler: Knit, good woman, knit, knit!
Nina: Mr.Douglas... (flirting defensively) ..cool tie.
Chandler: And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.
Chandler: Oh, no, no. Nina... (miming fairies twinkling around his head) ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.
Chandler: And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.
Ross: Susan, go deep.
Susan: What is, honey?
Susan: Carol, Carol, sweetie. Cleansing breath.
Rachel: This is just occurring to you?
Chandler: You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.

Chandler: Well, I ended up telling her everything.
Monica: Okay, I think I get how to do this.
Phoebe: Okay.
Monica: Are you alright?
Rachel: Oh... Oh, Pheebs.
Phoebe: I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...
Monica: Hon, you gotta talk to Joey.
Phoebe: Yeah. Okay.
Phoebe: Okay... Okay.
Phoebe: Oh, okay, oh.
Ursula: (Surprised) Oh.
Ursula: Yeah, um, may we help you?
