Ross: Hey! What are you guys looking at?
Ross: Yeah? Wow! It looks really violent!
Ross: Now I cannot wait to see this.
Phoebe: I started that!
Monica: Are we gonna take a limo?
Joey: Sure! Why not?!
Monica: Oh I love taking limos when nobody died!
Rachel: God. (Sits down.) I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!
Chandler: Hey! Did you have the baby yet?
Monica: What are you doing here so early?
Phoebe: Or you can do volunteer work.
Joey: Hello?
Joey: One guest? You told me I can have six tickets!
Estelle: Yeah, what time do you wanna pick me up? (Joey hangs up on her.) Hello?
Joey: (to Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe) Did you hear that? I only get one extra ticket to my premiere. So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross.
Rachel: (overhearing that) What-what about me?
Joey: Definitely not invisible.
Monica: Star in a movie.
Phoebe: Joey, you pick who ever you want. Okay? You just listen to your heart. What does it tell you? (Mimicking a heartbeat and tapping her chest.) Phoebe, Phoebe.
Chandler: You really want to take me?
Joey: Thanks. That means a lot to me.
Phoebe: Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.
Monica: Okay, how much?
Phoebe: One hundred thousand dollars!
Monica: How about fifty bucks?
Joey: A little tall.
Chandler: What?
Joey: Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller? (Chandler does so) There you go. (And they walk down the red carpet.)
Rachel: Oh, I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a squeeze toy. (Goes to the bathroom.)
Monica: Now stop it! Double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow!
Monica: Okay.
Ross: Rach, we gotta go.
Rachel: In a minute!!!
Rachel: Ross, it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks, I am somewhat comfortable.
Joey: (onscreen) "I thought I knew who the enemy was, but it was you all along." 
Rachel: Ross.
Ross: Yeah?
Rachel: Can I ask you something?
Ross: Uh-huh.
Ross: Mmm?
Ross: Wow!
Rachel: Excuse me?!
Rachel: Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.
Rachel: Hi Dr. Long, how are you?
Rachel: She has the drugs!
Rachel: Okay. (Rachel lies back.)
Dr. Long: So, eight days late huh?
Rachel: Yeah.
Dr. Long: You must be a little uncomfortable.
Rachel: Eh, just a tad.
Ross: Do them!!
Rachel: Well, we are ready to try anything.
Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: Great! We will do all of those.
Chandler: Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!
Joey: You liked it? You really liked it?
Chandler: Oh-ho-ho, yeah!
Joey: Which part exactly?
Chandler: The whole thing! Can we go?
Joey: Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.
Chandler: I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!
Joey: Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?
Chandler: I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
Monica: Hey!
Ross: Hey.
Rachel: Hi!
Monica: What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?
Rachel: No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.
Ross: Yeah, we tried them all. We went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea, caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked.
Monica: Do it!
Ross: Monica!
Ross: Monica, what is the matter with you?
Monica: Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today.
Rachel: Why? Why today?
Ross: What?!
Ross: Can I get some of that action?
Monica: Oh, okay!
Joey: Hey! Sleeping beauty!
Chandler: Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I still feel so bad!
Joey: (in a baby voice) Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep?
Chandler: What?!
Joey: Okay, five hundred dollars. What else?
Chandler: Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots.
Chandler: Do you want a calculator?
Joey: Please! 
Chandler: Here! (Hands him one. Joey adds it up and discovers that he was right.)
Joey: All right, what else?
Chandler: Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out Jamaican. 
Joey: What the hell are you talking about, (in a Jamaican accent) "The south will rise again man."
Chandler: Yes, money well spent!
Joey: Yeah. Okay, what else? Rent!
Ross: Come on, finish your enchilada.
Rachel: I am feeling nothing. Speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes me want to have sex with you.
Ross: Stop it.
Rachel: Make love? What are you a girl?
Ross: I love when you talk dirty to me.
Ross: Okay enough! This is, this is not going to happen.
Rachel: What?!
Ross: Forget it.
Rachel: (breaking the kiss) Oh God!
Ross: Oh, I know.
Rachel: Oh no. No-no! I think my water just broke.
Ross: I am good. Okay! Okay! Uh, I got the pillow! I got the bag! You got the keys?
Rachel: Okay! I got the keys! Okay! Okay!
Ross: Hey!
Rachel: Yeah.
Ross: Not so much.
Rachel: Okay.
Monica: Two hundred.
Phoebe: Thank you!
Phoebe: Okay.
Monica: Hello? (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Okay. (Hangs up.) I guess we can bet one more time.
Phoebe: Is Rachel having the baby?
