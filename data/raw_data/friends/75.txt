Phoebe: Hey! New wallet, huh?
Monica: Rachel!
Rachel: What?
Monica: You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!
Rachel: Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full.
Monica: Have you ever taken out the trash? (Hands her the garbage.)
Rachel: Well, I thought you liked doing it. (Rachel starts out the door and stops.)
Monica: Third door on the left.
Rachel: Right!
Rachel: Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.
Rachel: No.
Joey: Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
Rachel: Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true. 
Ross: Who is Maria?
Ross: You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
Chandler: No!
Joey: Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.
Joey: I have actually not heard of that.
Monica: So do them for free.
Ross: They make you take an oath?
Rachel: Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?
Monica: Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.
Ross: Then how do you explain the toe ring?!
Rachel: Oh! My hero! What happened?
Monica: What a minute, what did he say?
Rachel: What?! You got us evicted!!
Monica: I told you not to go down there!
Joey: Well he made Rachel cry!
Monica: Rachel always cries!
Rachel: Go!!
Ross: Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong.
Chandler: Yes. (In a stronger voice) Yes!
Chandler: No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
Chandler: Okay. (They go inside) (To the guy at the desk) I wanna quit the gym.
Chandler: I wanna quit the gym.
Ross: Me? No.
Chandler: (horrified at the prospect of trying to quit alone and unsure about himself) I wanna quit the gym.
Rick: (looking at her feet) Wow, you have really pretty feet.
Phoebe: These old things.
Rick: Yeah.
Rick: Oh, a 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.
Phoebe: Oh. (She goes to work, and her head slowly drops out of view.)
Rick: Ow! Did you just bite me?
Phoebe: No!
Joey: Yeah-yeah, absolutely.
Joey: What, what is it?
Monica: His dancing partner?!
Chandler: Hey.
Rachel: Hey! So, did you quit?
Monica: Wait, now so you joined the gym?
Monica: Well, you could actually go to the gym.
Ross: Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.
Phoebe: (entering) Hey.
All: Hey!
Phoebe: Ohh, you guys, remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him.
Rachel: Where?!
Phoebe: On the touchy.
Monica: Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.
Chandler: Thank you, Joey.
Joey: No-no, thank you.
Monica: Hey-hey, how goes the dancing? Gay yet?
Joey: Ah-ha-ha, you guys owe me big time. (He walks into the kitchen and does a little dance step on the way.)
Rachel: (laughing) What was that?
Joey: What?
Rachel: You just did a little dancy thing.
Monica: Yes you did! You did like a little hop.
Rachel: You are soo enjoying this.
Monica: (laughing harder) You know the words! You are so into this!
Rachel: Ooh, this is soo sweet, Joey our little twinkle-toes.
Monica: All right, then show me some manly moves.
Joey: All right.
Ross: Hello.
Chandler: Hi.
Ross: No-no.
Chandler: I wanna quit the bank!
Rick: Oh wow! That was amazing, was that really just an hour?!
Rick: What?
Rick: Wow! I had no idea! But you know, I could always find another masseuse. 
Phoebe: Really?!
Rick: Yeah, really.
Phoebe: What?
Phoebe: (laughs) Okay, quit down. (they start to kiss again)
Phoebe: Yes, I will tell her.
Ross: No! And somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account.
Rachel: What are you ever gonna use that for?!
Chandler: To pay for the gym.
Chandler: Hey.
Phoebe: Hey! So I had a great day, Rick and I really hit it off, and we started making out, and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore.
Joey: What?!
Rachel: You got fired?! 
Monica: Oh my Gosh!
Rachel: Sweety...
Joey: (To Mr. Treeger) So you ah, ready for our last practice?
Joey: Look, you wanna use our place?
Joey: We did it!!
Joey: I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful.
Joey: Oh well, okay, good luck.
Joey: Unless you wanna practice the Foxtrot again? Or-or the Tango?
Joey: Okay.
Joey: (intrigued) Really?
Phoebe: Yeah, they thought I was a whore.
Phoebe: Great! Thank you very much.
