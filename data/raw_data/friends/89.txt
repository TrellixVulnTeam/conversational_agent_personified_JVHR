Phoebe: Hey!
Chandler: Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum.
Chandler: All right.
Phoebe: Listen. Listen. (She starts to play and sing.) Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? 
Joey: Wow, Pheebs! That sounds great!
Alice: (entering) Phoebe! Phoebe! Hi! Hi!
Phoebe: Hey! What are you doing here?
Alice: Umm, actually, I came down to ask you a big favour.
Alice: (laughs) No. No. No. (Sits down.) Okay, now, see, I wanna name the girl baby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank JR. JR. 
Alice: You think about it. (Leaves)
Ross: Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.
Ross: Hey, uh, you can ignore that.
Carol: (knocking on the door) Ross!
Emily: Me too!
Susan: Ahh!
Emily: Are you all right?
Phoebe: Hi!
Joey: Hey!
Chandler: Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?
Chandler: Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
Joey: Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?
Joey: What do ya say? What do ya say?
Monica: Um-hmm.
Rachel: What am I making him by the way?
Rachel: I thought I was making him filet mignon? 
Monica: Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you (Points at Rachel) bitched about it, then you (Points to herself) would stop cooking, and you (Points at Rachel) would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
Rachel: Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.
Ross: Hey!
Joey: Hey!
Chandler: Hey!
Phoebe: God, Susan is so fun!
Ross: Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was: "My friend Susan is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great."
Chandler: You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?
Ross: How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her!
Phoebe: No! No! I-I meant for the baby!
Joey: Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler.
Chandler: Raymond Chandler.
Joey: Yeah, that guy really hurt us.
Chandler: Okay.
Joshua: This is so nice. Thank you for doing this.
Rachel: Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. (They kiss.) Ahh. So, dig in!
Joshua: Great! Oh, it all looks sooo good!
Rachel: (taking a bite) Hmmm!
Joshua: Oh my God!
Joshua: Behind you?
Rachel: Yeah, sure, okay. Okay.
Joey: (answering the door.) Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in. (He brings them inside.)
Rachel: All gone! So, farm birds, huh?
Rachel: Oh.
Joshua: So, all right.
Rachel: Ohh.
Rachel: Yeah that works.
Joshua: They-they-they can smell fear.
Ross: (opening the door.) Hey!
Carol: Hey, Ben! Hey!
Ross: So umm, any word from Susan?
Carol: Oh my God, you are so paranoid! 
Ross: Am I?!
Carol: Yes!
Ross: Am I?!
Carol: Maybe.
Rachel: Wow! This place is fabulous!
Joshua: Yeah, yeah, let me show you around. This is the uh, downstairs living room.
Rachel: Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?
Rachel: That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?
Rachel: Ah.
Joshua: Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?
Joshua: Umm, this may be a little weird, but I-I-I got a date here.
Rachel: Hi you!
Joshua: Oh my God!
Rachel: I know, I can do more than cook.
Rachel: Hello.
Rachel: Yes!
Joshua: There you go.
Rachel: Yes.
Joey: Dude, I am sorry about what I said!
Chandler: Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.
Chandler: I have no name.
Phoebe: All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?
Chandler: Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.
Joey: No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.
Chandler: Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?
Phoebe: Umm, Gene.
Joey: See you later, Gene.
Phoebe: Bye, Gene.
Monica: So, you wore your nightie to dinner?
Rachel: Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out.
Phoebe: Oh my God!
Monica: Oh, no!
Ross: (returning from the phone.) So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she and Susan are going to a poetry reading together! 
Rachel: So?
Ross: Oh, wake up!
Phoebe: Wow, Carol really messed you up!
Ross: Excuse me?
Rachel: Huh.
Ross: What?
Monica: This totally makes sense!
Ross: It does not!
Rachel: Absolutely! Absolutely!
Monica: This is so much fun!
Ross: This is not fun!
Ross: Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.
Phoebe: Drum roll.
Chandler: (entering) Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
Chandler: All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.
Chandler: (pleased) Really?!
Phoebe: Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!
Chandler: Okay. Thanks.
Phoebe: Okay!
Chandler: You wanna hug it out?
Phoebe: Yeah!
Phoebe: Yay! 
Chandler: Yay! 
Chandler: Okay!
Chandler: Bye, Pheebs!
Phoebe: Okay, bye! 
Chandler: Ha! Ha! Ha!
Joey: Ohh! (Realises it was all a trick to get Phoebe to name the baby Chandler.)
Ross: Nice luggage.
Susan: Hey!
Ross: Hi!
Emily: Hey! I missed you.
Ross: Oh, I missed you too.
Susan: (To Emily) Thanks for everything, I had such a great time.
Emily: Oh, so did I.
Ross: (To Carol) No tongue. (And gives her the thumbs up.)
