Rachel: I-I, got a job at Ralph Lauren.
Rachel: Yeah. (chuckling) A year ago..
Monica: We should go.
Phoebe: Thank you.
Rachel: Sure.
Phoebe: Now you will not believe this. But, I was in the copy room, making copies, and Ralph Lauren came in.
Rachel: Oh my God. Did you talk to him?
Phoebe: Yeah a little. He seems really nice. Good kisser.
Rachel: What? What!?! You kissed him?
Phoebe: Totally.
Rachel: (Gasps) Phoebe are you serious?
Phoebe: No!
Janine: Hey Joey.
Joey: Hey. Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. Do you, uh, know this kid? Is that like a relative or something?

Janine: Ohh. Like what?
Joey: Yeah, well, it feels different.
Kim: Uhh-huh.

Monica: How much longer?
Ross: A-A day.
Monica: Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?
Monica: She will be after tonight.
Chandler: Yeah. (Rachel walks in.)
Rachel: Yeah. Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside. (Sitting down on the couch.) You guys are never going to believe this. But, Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.
Chandler: What???
Monica: Oh my god.
Chandler: I am proud of all my friends today.
Monica: Chandler, please, come on. Look at him. (Pointing to a picture of Ralph on a magazine,.)
Chandler: Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish. (Phoebe walks in.)
Rachel: What?
Phoebe: What?
Rachel: Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe!!
Phoebe: Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren?
Rachel: To get you to make out with him!!!
Phoebe: Ohhh.
Ross: Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.
Monica: Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.
Monica: Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on.
Ross: What??
Monica: All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see.
Ross: No. I am not putting on makeup. (Knock at the door. Phoebe enters.)
Phoebe: Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? (He smiles at her.) OH!! Demon!! Demon!!
Chandler: No thanks, Josephine.
Rachel: Ohh, hi, Kim.
Kim: Hi Rachel.
Rachel: No.
Rachel: Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.
Kim: Listen to me. If you think sleeping with Ralph is going to get you my job. You are sadly mistaken.
Kim: Hi Ralph.
Kim: Yeah, nothing happen. You could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife.
Hillary: And after that, what could I do except become a chef.
Ross: Mmm-Hmm.
Hillary: And someday soon, I hope to open my own restaurant.
Ross: Mmm.
Ross: Mm-Hmm.
Ross: (Chuckling) Hmm-Hmm.
Ross: Mmm-Unmm.
Hillary: Come on. I want to know.
Monica: Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.
Chandler: Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
Joey: Ohh, I love birds. (Monica leaves. Chandler shuts the door.)
Chandler: What is the matter with you ?!?
Joey: What?
Rachel: Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.
Phoebe: Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did she ever think of that?
Phoebe: Just for a second.
Rachel: Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?
Phoebe: Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.
Phoebe: Ohh, sleep with Kenny.
Phoebe: Ohh, yes it would.
Ross: Mmm.
Hillary: You know, I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date.
Hillary: Are you going to eat that bread?
Ross: (Putting the bread up to his nose.) Ohh, I just like the smell. (Sniffing it.) Mmmm.
Hillary: (Laughing) You make me laugh.
Ross: Hmm-Hmm.
Hillary: Would you like to move over to the couch?
Ross: Mmm-Hmm. (Picking up their wine glasses.)
Ross: (Covering his mouth with the glass.) How about all the way.
Hillary: Okay. (She goes to turn the lights off and Ross sits on the couch. She has some black light posters on the wall.)
Ross: (Looking at the posters.) Wow, cool poster. Or should I say groovy poster? (They sit down on the couch. Ross smiles and the black light fluoresces his teeth.) So, ahh, where were we?
Hillary: Are those your teeth??
Ross: Ohh, you can see them, huh?
Ross: I-I, did that for you.
Rachel: Kim, hi.

Rachel: You and Ralph?
Kim: Kenny the copyboy.
Janine: Hey.
Joey: Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you.

Janine: Joey? Do you want me to put it all in your room?
Joey: (Smiling) Okay.
