Ross: You sure?
Ben: Uh-huh!
Chandler: Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there. (Does so.)
Ben: (To Chandler) Thanks daddy.
Chandler: Okay. Okay.
Ross: Yes! Yes! Yes!! (Everyone stands and claps.)
Ross: Yeah.
Phoebe: I never had a bike of my own.
Ross: (shocked) What?!
Chandler: That sounds like my first bike. (They all turn and look at him.) My dad gave me his old one.
Ross: Ohh.
Monica: Did the girl ever let you ride it?
Ross: That is so unfair!
Phoebe: Not really, I got to drag him around too! (They all nod, "Oh.")
Chandler: Hey! What are you guys doing? 
Joey: Hey.
Monica: Making holiday candy for the neighbors.
Rachel: (entering, happily) Gooood morning!!
Monica: Where you can make out with your assistant.
Monica: Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?!
Rachel: Anymore!!
Monica: Okay.
Rachel: Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct?
Tag: Yes, at 4:00.
Tag: My what?
Tag: Are you serious?
Monica: The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!
Monica: Joey!! 
Joey: Yeah?
Monica: Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!
Joey: Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!
Monica: Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!
Phoebe: Sure!
Phoebe: (gasps) Oh my God Ross!!
Ross: You like it?
Phoebe: I love it!!
Ross: Yeah?
Phoebe: Ohh!! Ohh!! And I love you!
Ross: Ahh.
Phoebe: Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer!
Chandler: (about to cry) Am not!
Monica: (turning a light on) Who is that?!
Gary: Hi!
Monica: Hi. Do you know what time it is?
Monica: Oh please! (To Chandler) Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.
Chandler: (laughs) 4:00 A.M.
Gary: So, can I get some candy?
Chandler: I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work! (Monica looks at him) (To Monica) He does not know that I am not some of us.
Monica: Um-hmm.
Rachel: (hugging him) So did you read your evaluation yet?
Tag: No! It was marked confidential, I just sent it down to Human Resources.
Tag: A joke they would appreciate?
Tag: What did you say?!
Rachel: Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your tiney-tiny tushie.
Tag: No, not my tushie.
Rachel: Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, "Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision," and under Problems with Performance I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not," and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.
Monica: Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.
Joey: Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
Chandler: Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!
Joey: (about to cry) Those two only had each other!
Ross: Phoebe really likes the bike huh?
Ross: Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times?
Joey: Hey Pheebs?
Phoebe: Oh hi!
Chandler: Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?
Phoebe: Ohh, uh-huh so much!
Phoebe: Of course!
Monica: Umm, can we see you ride it?
Phoebe: Okay. (The gang is giggles then as Phoebe gets the bike out of the rack, gets on, pushes off, rolls a few feet, and falls over.) See?
Monica: See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And there is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. (To Chandler) Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!
Rachel: Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!
Joey: Hey Rach?
Rachel: Yeah?
Rachel: Oh my God! Joey!
Chandler: What is the matter with you?
Rachel: Ugh!
Joey: Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could afford porn.
The Woman: Please! I have people coming from out of town today! And, I told them all about your candy!
Joey: (watching the discussion) Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?
The Woman: (exasperatedly) Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!
The Woman: (after Monica gives her the candy) Thank you.
Monica: Hmm?
Chandler: Stop making candy!
Monica: But they like it!
Chandler: You mean they like you.
Monica: Maybe.
Chandler: Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
Monica: Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man? (Joey laughs but stops when Chandler turns to glare at him.)
Phoebe: Why? Why do I have to learn?
Phoebe: What kind of an emergency?
Phoebe: Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.
Ross: No!
Phoebe: Swear?!
Ross: I swear!
Phoebe: (thinks it over) Okay. 
Ross: Come on. (She gets on the bike.) All right, here we go. All right? (They start.) 
Phoebe: All right.
Ross: All right. Feel good?
Ross: All right, try pedaling. 
Phoebe: Okay. (Does so.)
Phoebe: Okay.
Ross: Doing great! Yes-yes-yes! Take control! Yes!
Phoebe: Weee!!! (Ross pushes her and lets go.)
Ross: Yes!! Yes!!! (He starts clapping and Phoebe turns around to look at him and falls off the bike.)
Phoebe: Oh! Oh! Oh no!! You swore!
Phoebe: I am shocked! Shocked!! (She storms off leaving Ross to defend himself from the angry looks from onlookers.)
Ross: Need some help?
Phoebe: (seeing him) Oh, hello liar.
Ross: I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were so close Phoebe!
Ross: Phoebe.
Phoebe: What?! (Ross rings the bell.) What the hell?!
Phoebe: What?! Why?!
Phoebe: All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.
Rachel: Yeah, well Betty is kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates. (Holding up the box of chocolates.) Now, while I distract her, you get in the office.
Tag: Got it!
Rachel: Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates? (Holds up the box.)
Rachel: (laughs) Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, (getting serious) what would happen exactly.
Tag: (interrupting again) Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, I thought it would be funny.
Rachel: What?
Tag: I feel great. (Rachel laughs) In fact! (Walks over to her desk, sweeps its contents onto the floor and Rachel just glares at him.) What?
Rachel: (looking at his butt) There it is. (They hug.)
Chandler: (asking a man leaning against the wall) What is going on? 
Joey: Yeah lady! Give us candy!!
Chandler: Joey!
Chandler: What are you doing?
Joey: Waiting for candy.
Chandler: Get in here! (They head for the door and Chandler sees Smokes-A-Lot Lady standing next to the door and smoking, to her) Hey, and you can not smoke in here! (Takes the cigarette and takes a drag for himself.) (Exhaling in ecstasy) Merry Christmas.
Monica: (opening the door and frantically) Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!
All: We want candy! We want candy now! (And other general commotion sounds.)
The Man: (from earlier) Candy Lady?
Chandler: No not (imitating) Candy Lady.
Joey: (stepping in and knocking the man over) Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!!
Monica: (To Chandler) Thank you.
Monica: Did you smoke?
