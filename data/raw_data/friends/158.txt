Joey: Yeah!
Joey: Two days ago.
Joey: Oh yeah?
Ross: (returning) Hey.
Chandler: Bye! (Exits.)
Ross: Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
Joey: Obviously! So, how do we decide?
Ross: Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.
Joey: Yeah well we should order some food then.
Joey: (smiling) That sounds fair.
Ross: I was thinking more like a hundred.
Joey: Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
Phoebe: I know. Hand me a tissue. (Monica hands her one.)

Ross: I am dressed.
Joey: Oh. Well good! (To himself) For me. (He picks up a jar of lotion.) What is this? Did you give yourself a facial?

Ross: Much better.
Kristen: Yeah, little Eric.
Kristen: You said the waiter ate my crab cake.
Kristen: Do you two know each other?
Joey: No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
Ross: Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
Joey: Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
Ross: Hey you leave Marcel out of this!
Joey: Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!

Chandler: Why? Do you have another boyfriend in there or something?
Monica: No! We only mess around at his place!

Chandler: Okay!
Monica: (entering) Hey guys! Do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding? (They ignore her.) Guys?
Chandler: (without turning around) I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
