Joey: (coming in from his bedroom) What is that?
Joey: Maybe he found you flip-flop.
Chandler: Hey!
Chandler: Do we pay for this?
Chandler: Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!
Chandler: Like finding money with naked people on it!
Joey: (to Chandler) Why would he turn off the TV? (Chandler shrugs.)
Joey: Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!
Chandler: And no one touches the air around the TV!
Joey: Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?
Chandler: We still have porn.
Joey: Hey.
Phoebe: (entering, carrying her massage table) Hi!
Monica: Hi!
Phoebe: Yeah.
Rachel: Give it here. (She takes the table.) Oh, God. (And gives it to Monica right away.)
Monica: Okay.
Phoebe: You mean like a doctor?
Phoebe: Ohh! (She moves.) Oh my. Oh, that reminds me, I have to see my OB-GYN today.
Ross: Hi.
Monica: Hi.
Ross: So uh, Emily just went to the airport.
Monica: You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!
Ross: (Thinks about it.) Nah.
Ross: And why do you care so much?
Monica: Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
Ross: You had fantasies about Emily?
Ross: Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?
Monica: Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!
Ross: Ahh.
Monica: Do you love her?
Monica: You love her!
Ross: What-what is love really?
Ross: I am a good kisser.
Rachel: Is that the heartbeat?
Phoebe: Oh my God!
Rachel: Oh wow! This is so cool.
Phoebe: Well, yeah.
Rachel: Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!
Phoebe: What do you know?!
Alice: (entering) Oh-oh, Phoebe!
Phoebe: Ooh! Hi!
Frank: Yes.
Alice: Three babies?
Frank: I finally got my band!
Frank: Why would we be freaked?
Alice: Right.
Phoebe: No, back to happy. Back to happy!
Alice: No, Frank.
Frank: Yeah, refrigerator college.
Alice: Yeah.
Ross: Emily! (Runs up.)
Emily: Oh my God! What are you doing here? (They hug)
Ross: I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off.
Emily: You are so sweet. (They kiss.)
Emily: Me too.
Joey: Yeah right.
Rachel: No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.
Chandler: Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?
Rachel: Yes!
Joey: Yeah, he likes porn.
Monica: Where ya going?
Phoebe: Hey.
Joey: Hey!
Monica: How did it go with Frank and Alice?
Monica: Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?
Ross: I did.
Monica: And well, what did she say?
Ross: Thank you.
Ross: She said, "Thank you." I said, "I love you." And she said, "Thank you."
Chandler: Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?
Joey: Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!
Ross: What do I do now?
Joey: You play hard to get.
Ross: She already lives in London.
Joey: Then you go to Tokyo.
Chandler: What?
Monica: You know!
Chandler: Okay. (Pause) Good one.
Joey: Way to be strong, man!
Rachel: Hey!
Chandler: Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
Chandler: Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
Monica: Hey!
Phoebe: Hi!
Chandler: Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
Phoebe: No!
Monica: Are you sure?
Phoebe: No!
Phoebe: No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
Phoebe: My Saturn dealership.
Ross: (Answers the phone.) Hello?
Emily: Ross.
Ross: Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?
Emily: It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.
Ross: Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
Chandler: You put your fist through the wall?
Ross: No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!
Monica: You have to go to London!
Ross: What?
Monica: Yeah, you have to go fight for her!
Monica: When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?
Ross: I made fun of his accent.
Ross: No.
Monica: All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily! (Points to the TV.) That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!
Ross: Really?
Monica: All right.
Monica: Okay, good luck!
Rachel: Hey!
Rachel: Okay.
Chandler: A place where no one will ever get out alive?
Rachel: (interrupting) Relaxi-Taxi!
Phoebe: The name was my favourite part!
Rachel: Well, well I can up with it!
Monica: Hello.
Ross: (on phone) Hey.
Monica: Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?
Monica: All right. When is, when is the next flight out?
Ross: About four hours.
Phoebe: Oh, that is better.
Chandler: Are we in London?
Emily: What?
Joey: (pause) Nothing. No, nothing.
Monica: Oh.
Ross: Hi.
Emily: Ross, I love you!
Ross: Ohh! Thank you.
Chandler: Hey.
Joey: Hey.
Joey: Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!
Chandler: What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"
Joey: Noo! Nothing!
Chandler: All right, ready?
Joey: One.
Chandler: Two.
Both: Three.
Joey: Yeah.
Chandler: You wanna see if we still have it?
Joey: Yeah.
