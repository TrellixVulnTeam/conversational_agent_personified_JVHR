Rachel: Hi!
Monica: Oh. 
Rachel: Ahh!
Rachel: Okay.
Kids: Trick or treat!
Kids: Trick or treat!!
Rachel: (to them) Just a minute!!! (She takes the candy and opens the door to
two parents, a witch, a clown, and a cowgirl.) Look at you guys! Wow! You are a very scary
witch. (Gives her candy.)
Witch: Thank you.
Rachel: And you are a very funny clown. (Gives him candy.)
Clown: Thank you.
Cowgirl: (interrupting) Can I just have the candy?
Rachel: Yeah. Sure. (Throws some in her bag and she walks away as Phoebe,
dressed as Supergirl walks up and eyes Monica who eyes her back.)
Phoebe: Ah, Catwoman. So we meet again.
Monica: So we do Supergirl.
Rachel: (To Monica) Oh, you did this to him?
Chandler: The Velveteen Rabbit was brown and white!
Monica: Well, it was either a pink bunny or no bunny at all.
Chandler: No bunny at all!! Always no bunny at all!!!

Girl: Trick or treat!
Ballerina: Thank you. (Pirouettes.)
Rachel: Oh wow! That deserves another piece of candy.
Ballerina: Thank you. (Does another ballerina move.)
Rachel: Well, I have to say that earns tutu pieces of candy.
Ballerina: I love you! (Hugs Rachel.)
Rachel: Yeah I know, but one of them just said that she loved me so I just gave
her everything.
Phoebe: No wonder your pregnant.
Rachel: Hey.
Monica: What are you supposed to be?
Joey: (sees Ross) Hey all right, Ross came as doody.
Monica: No, space doody!
Phoebe: Okay, I will. But right after you tell me who the hell you are.
Eric: Ursula?
Phoebe: Yeah.
Phoebe: Yeah.
Phoebe: My mother killed herself.
Phoebe: Why are you looking at me like that?
Phoebe: Okay. (Hands him a napkin.) So, what are you?
Phoebe: (laughs) No I-I meant your costume.
Phoebe: I love the second grade!
Eric: Really?
Eric: So what do you do?
Phoebe: Thank you.
Monica: Hey Joey?
Joey: Yeah.
Monica: You read comic books right?
Joey: Exclusively.
Monica: Who do you think would win in a fight, Catwoman or Supergirl?
Joey: Catwoman, hands down.
Monica: What?! Really?!
Monica: What?! Come on I am tough! Punch me right here! (Her stomach) As hard as
you can!
Joey: I would say, "Woman, please!"
Monica: Oh my God, Phoebe!
Phoebe: What?

Monica: Yeah.
Eric: Hey beautiful.
Phoebe: Hello handsome. (Sees Ursula over her shoulder) Oh God. (Walks away in
shame as they kiss.) Oh look at you two. So when did you guys meet?
Eric: Two weeks ago.
Phoebe: Oh really?
Phoebe: Huh? (Ursula motions for Phoebe to keep quiet.)
Eric: And we were both in the Peace Corps.
Eric: In fact when we were building houses in Uruguay, we were, we were just two
towns apart and we never met.
Eric: Sure.
Chandler: Howdy doody.
Joey: (To Monica) Hey-hey-hey, I think we might find out the answer to our
question.
Chandler: What question?
Joey: Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you
or Ross?
Joey: So you think Ross too?
Chandler: (To Monica) You picked Ross?!
Mona: Hey, you guys could arm wrestle.
Joey: Yeah. Listen to the slutty nurse.
Joey: Seriously guys, the trash talk is embarrassing.
Rachel: Oh Gunther! You brought candy! Thank you so much for picking this up!
You are so sweet.
Gunther: Really?
Rachel: Honey, someday you are gonna make some man the luckiest guy in the
world.
Kid: Trick or treat!
Rachel: Gotta go! (Opens the door to a boy in a cape.) Hi! Wow! There you go!
(Hands him some candy.)
Rachel: Well is it fair that all you did was put on a cape and I gotta give you
free stuff?
Rachel: You shut up!
Rachel: Uh, I think I just did. And uh-oh, here it comes again. Shut up!
Joey: Rach?
Chandler: That means nothing to me. (To Ross) Come on!
Phoebe: Hi liar!
Ursula: Hey!
Ursula: Well they could be true.
Phoebe: Why are you lying to him?
Eric: (entering) Honey?
Ursula: Right. (Walks down the stairs.)
Eric: (To Phoebe) Well, it was nice meeting you.
Phoebe: You too. And Ursula?! It was really nice meeting you tonight!!
Ross: Pride.
Chandler: And dignity.
Joey: (laughing) Okay, if you say so. All right, ready? Set! Go!
Joey: Or equally weak.
Monica: (To Phoebe) Oh God!
Phoebe: Hmm?
Chandler: Nope! I can do this all day.
Chandler: Fine. (He lets Ross win.) Oh no! 
Ross: (celebrating) Oh yeah!
Mona: (clapping) Yay! My hero!
Eric: (entering) Hey. Ursula said she left her purse.
Phoebe: Oh.
Eric: (finds it) What a relief. It has all the numbers of the people in her
prayer chain.
Phoebe: Sure it does. Yeah, yeah.
Eric: What?
Eric: She told me she was 25.
Phoebe: Yeah, you should. (They shake hands.)
Ursula: Hurry up I gotta pray!!
Joey: Hey!
Rachel: Hey! Well, I had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying.
Rachel: No, I also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. Oh,
I am just awful with children!
Monica: (laughs) Is that a secret or a lie.
Ross: Yeah?
Chandler: Would you tell her I let you win please?
Monica: Chandler please!
