Assistant: This kitty is Mittens, this one is Fitzhugh, and this little guy 
in the cat condo is Jinkys.
Chandler: Chandler Bing.
Joey: Okay. What have we wanted to always do together?
Chandler: Courtside? Oh my god!!
Joey: Yeah, maybe Michael Jordan will dive for the ball and break my jaw with 
his knee!
Monica: Hello?
Rachel: I hope the ends of these sentences are good!
Ross: Oh, right! [Looking away]
Rachel: Yeah! Phoebe and I are gonna have so much fun! Thank you for watching 
the baby, by the way.
Ross: Yeah.
Rachel: Yeah?
Phoebe: Hi!
Rachel: Okay. You too. And I hope you score.
Rachel: Bye [to Mike]
Mike: Bye [Shuts door]
Ross: So, welcome!
Ross: Okay
Ross: So, Phoebe tells me you, er, play the piano?
Mike: Yeah?
Ross: You, you know? I used to play the keyboards in college.
Mike: Yah, do you have one here?
Ross: No
Mike: Okay [nervous laugh]
Mike: Ahhh.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Ah!
Ross: Well, he and I would probably have a lot to talk about.
Monica: Hi! [Surprised]
Chandler: Hey!
Monica: Welcome home.
Chandler: Oh, well, look at you!
Monica: What do you think?
Monica: Just a second.
Monica: Why not?
Monica: So you lied to him?
Chandler: Eh, it is always better to lie than to have the complicated 
discussion. [Monica glares at him] Except with you!
Monica: Hi!
Joey: Why are you dressed like that?
Joey: Woah, woah, woah. Why are there two glasses of wine out?
Monica: You might wanna keep practising.
Monica: What?
Chandler: Hey, Joe!
Joey: Dude, come home!
Chandler: What? Why?
Joey: Come home!
Chandler: [Loudly] No!
Joey: I just heard him!
Chandler: [Quiet] Can you hear him now?
Chandler: [Loudly] No! Wait!
Joey: I heard him again!
Chandler: Right. Just stay there. I'm coming home.
Chandler: Is that really necessary?
Mike: [Looks at watch] Eleven minutes. [Still looking at watch] And now 
twelve. [Picks up bottle] Do you like the beer?
Ross: I do. I do. Although it is actually a lager.
Mike: Things are about to get wild!
Rachel: Oh, god. It seems like forever ago.
Phoebe: I know.
Phoebe: Woah! Oh my god! I love things! What happened?
Rachel: Well, um, first he told me that he liked how I looked, and then, erm, 
we had a little, erm, eye contact.
Phoebe: Eye contact?
Rachel: Uh huh.
Phoebe: I hope you were using protection.
Waiter: Excuse me, um, these are from the two gentlemen at the end of the 
bar.
Phoebe: So, what if they do?
Monica: Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you are not in Tulsa.
Chandler: Just gonna wait for a little while.
Bill: Spuds is your grandmother?
Bill: So, she has a boyfriend. [To Rachel] What is your situation?
Bill: Can I have your number?
Bill: Okay [They start to leave]
Rachel: Oh, sure!
Rachel: Great. [Gives thumbs up]
Bill: Bye [Leaves]
Phoebe: Wow. So that's great. You, Bill, Ross and Emma are going to be so 
happy together. What were you thinking?
Phoebe: Yeah, I see what you mean. By the way, nice Ross imitation. But your 
Rachel was not whiney enough.
Rachel: Hey!
Phoebe: Better!
Rachel: The point is: maybe I should stop waiting around, waiting for moments 
with Ross. I should just move on with my life.
Phoebe: So, really? Are you moving on from Ross?
Rachel: Dunno, do I have to decide right now?
Ross: So soon?
Mike: Yeah.
Ross: Okay. Thanks, er, for the beer.
Mike: You mean lager.
Ross: Ah, yeah, good times.
Mike: Ohh. [Relieved to be out of there]
Ross: Ohh. [Relieved that Mike has gone]
Mike: Hello?
Mike: Uh no, I just left.
Phoebe: Well, you have to go back in.
Mike: What? Go back? To the land where time stands still?
Phoebe: Oh, oh, Mike! Bye. [Hangs up]
Mike: Hey, buddy!
Ross: Hi!
Mike: Can I come back in?
Ross: W-Why? [Blocking route of entry]
Mike: Well, [negotiating an entrance] I was just thinking of how muck more we 
have to talk about.
Ross: [Exasperated] But, you left!
Monica: What are you saying?
Monica: There's no man in here! How dare you accuse me of that? [Slaps 
Chandler]
Monica: I arranged some pillows on the bed to make it look like a guy!
Monica: I think that's you.
Joey: Oh yeah, I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.
Chandler: Nobody here, Joe.
Joey: I guess not.
Ross: [Looking bored] Maybe you should look up fascinating.
Monica: Joey?
Joey: Yeah?
Chandler: I feel so bad. Is there, is there anything I can do to make it up 
to you?
Joey: [Looking sad] Alright.
Monica: You can go.
Chandler: [Turning around] What?
Chandler: Really? Are you going to be okay?
Joey: Okay.
Chandler: And I want you to know that no-one thinks that you are stupid.
Joey: Thanks, man. [They walk down the hall. Chandler looks at his ticket. 
Turns around and heads back to his apartment.] Where ya going?
Rachel: So, what did you guys do?
Phoebe: Well, goodbye!
Mike: Bye!
Rachel: Have fun, Pheebs! See ya guys. [Phoebe and Mike leave]
Ross: Rachel, lock the door, lock the door, seriously!
Rachel: Oh shoot, I forgot to pay Phoebe for the drinks! [Goes outside into 
the hallway] Wait, wait. So, did he call? Did that guy call?
Mike: No, just his mom.
Rachel: Oh, around 8:30?
Mike: Yeah.
Rachel: Then again at 9?
Mike: Uh huh.
Rachel: Ahhh.
Ross: So, er, so how was it? Have you guys, you guys, had a good time?
Ross: Ah, Rach?
Rachel: Yeah?
Ross: Never mind.
Ross: Hey, you guys!
Ross: Ah.
