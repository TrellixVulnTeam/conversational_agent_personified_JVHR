Monica: Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!! (She runs back to her apartment.)
Rachel: Who are you saying "check" too?
Phoebe: Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only did it the one time. But it was pretty weird.
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Monica: Hey!
Ross: Hey! Are you ready yet?
Monica: Yep! You got the tickets?
Chandler: You got your passport?
Joey: Ohh!! (Runs to his room.)
Chandler: There it is.
Monica: Yeah, okay, give that a try!
Joey: Woo-hoo!!
Ross: Yeah, cheerie-o! 
Joey: London baby!
Joey: (louder) London baby!!
Phoebe: Great! Yeah, could you bring me the newspaper?
Ross: Yeah. (He does so and Phoebe hugs him.)
Phoebe: Oh, have a great wedding!
Ross: Thanks.
Phoebe: Oh, hey, Chandler I wanna hug you too!
Chandler: Hey! (Trots over)
Rachel: Have fun!
Rachel: Oh, I know.
Rachel: What?!
Ross: This is my wedding.
Phoebe: (laughs) Thank you.
Phoebe: Thank you. (She pats him on his head.)
Joey: Bye, Pheebs!
Joey: London baby!! (And Rachel slowly closes the door, sadly.)
Joey: Come on! Do something!
Joey: Okay, here! (Gives him the camera.) I wanna be the on camera guy. All right, first stop, Westminster Abbey. (Joey folds out his "pop-up" map of London. All of the major landmarks pop-up like in a pop-up book.)
Chandler: Oh, what the hell is that?
Chandler: Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!
Joey: I got it! (Picks up the map and starts walking.) Here we go.
Joey: Shhh! (Pause) Man, you made me lose it! (He goes into the map again.)
Ross: Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily, (Gives her the time-out signal.) honey, okay?
Emily: Well, up yours too!
Emily: Sorry.
Monica: Chicken Kiev?
Emily: Oh. Oh. (She starts running towards the building.)
Emily: (running in, with Ross) Oh. Oh my God. How can this be happening? What are we going to do?
Ross: Uh-huh, I see that.
Monica: (entering) Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what happened. 
Ross: What? What?
Monica: They torn it down a few days early.
Joey: Really? To what?
Chandler: To Put the Camera Away!!!
Joey: Man, you are Westminster Crabby. (He starts chasing Chandler towards the Abbey.)
Phoebe: Oh. Oh.
Phoebe: Oh, no. Oh, nothing.
Rachel: Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.
Phoebe: Okay, I have a wedgie.
Rachel: Okay, that is all you.
Phoebe: So-so, what do you want for lunch?
Rachel: (interrupting) Still in love with?! 
Phoebe: Yeah!
Phoebe: Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.
Phoebe: We thought you knew!
Rachel: We?!
Phoebe: Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!
Rachel: You all know? Does Ross know?
Joey: Hey!
Joey: Well, I like it. Here you go. (He pays for the hat.)
Joey: Oh, I embarrass you? 
Chandler: Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
Joey: Thanks.
Emily: Hello?
Ross: Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?
Emily: No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.
Ross: She said what?
Emily: Or?
Phoebe: Hey!
Rachel: (depressed) Hi.
Phoebe: So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?
Rachel: Manhattan does not have enough stores.
Phoebe: Well, I think I can help you get over him.
Rachel: You can?
Phoebe: Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.
Rachel: Um-hmm.
Phoebe: And a small piece of chocolate.
Rachel: Okay.
Phoebe: And a glass of tepid water. (She gathers up all of these things.)
Rachel: Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?
Rachel: I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.
Rachel: Okay.
Phoebe: Okay?
Rachel: All right.
Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: Ow!
Phoebe: Okay, how do you feel now?
Rachel: Well, I like you less!
Joey: Hey.
Chandler: Hey. (He nods at the hat.)
Joey: Oh. (Takes off the hat.) Sorry!
Joey: Me too.
Chandler: Yeah?
Monica: (entering) Hey!
Joey: Sh-shh-shh! (He motions for her to watch something he has taped.)
Joey: (on tape) Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat. 
Joey: (on tape) Oh, Chandler.
Fergie: Hi Chandler! (Waves) 
Monica: Oh my God!
Chandler: How did you? How? How?
Monica: Hey!
Ross: Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.
Monica: (laughs) Yes, I did! And you are welcome!
Ross: Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!
Joey: Wait up! (They both run to the bathroom.)
Monica: She said that?!
Ross: Yeah.
Monica: Why?!
Ross: Excuse me?
Monica: Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?
Ross: I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.
Monica: Sometimes we were.
Ross: Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?
Monica: Okay.
Ross: Come on. (They leave and Chandler sticks his head out.)
Chandler: That was pretty intense huh?
Chandler: (glares at him) I hope he did!
Phoebe: Hello.
Joey: That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?
Phoebe: All right, the seven of us miss you.
Joey: Ahh, the babies miss me?
Joey: What? You ordered pizza without me?!
Joey: Two pizzas?!
Phoebe: Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later.
Joey: Wait, well, where did you get it from?! 
Emily: Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!
Emily: I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen.
Emily: Oh God.
Rachel: Pheebs?
Phoebe: Yeah?
Rachel: Do you remember where the duck food is?
Rachel: Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel! He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
Phoebe: Hello, Hello. Ohh, OHH, she knew I could kick her ass.
Monica: Hey.
Ross: (Ross hugs his mom and dad)Hi. Mom. Dad.
Emily: Ohh, here comes my dad and stepmum. Mister and Misses Geller, this is Steven and Andrea Waltham.
Waiter: Sir? (Looking at Joey.)
Waiter: Goat cheese, water chestnuts, and panchetta. (Joey Looks down disgustingly at the food.)
Rachel: (Running to the ticket counter) Ooh, ooh, ooh,ooh,ooh. (Slightly out of breath) Hi.
Rachel: (Faking cheerfulness.) Hello. Umm, when is your next flight to London?
Rachel: Ohh, good.
Rachel: Ohh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
Rachel: Ohh, okay, how about five. (She hands her all the credit cards.) Ohh, thank you.
Ross: Look, face it, my father is not going to pay for the build-in barbecue and believe me you can kiss you gazebo goodbye. Now I might be able to get you the new lawn.
Rachel: (Running to her room.) Hi, Pheebs.
Rachel: (Running back out the door with her passport.) Bye, Pheebs.
Phoebe: (Trying to get up.) Wait!! Where are you going?! What are you doing?! No!! Wait!! (Not able to get up.) God!! Why am I always pregnant when she does that?!
Felicity: (Putting her arm around Joey.) Are you going home? I was hoping to get to know you better.
Monica: I was laughing. (Patting him on the knee.)
Chandler: Out loud?
Chandler: So how are you doing?
Drunk Man: I just want to say that Ross is a wonderful young man.
Monica: Well, thanks, we like him.
Drunk Man: My god!! You must have been a teenage when you had him. (Monica stares straight forward after the comment. Chandler tries to console her by patting her on the shoulder.)
Ross: Look, were down to just one point. Could we please, maybe just settle it after the wedding.
Monica: Then why would he say it?
Rachel: Hello. I need to get on the 11 o'clock flight.
Rachel: All right, you know what? I am not leaving here, until you call that plane back!! (She pounds her hand on the counter twice. The ticket agent counters by placing the closed sign on the counter and tapping it twice.)
Chandler: (With the covers pulled up to his chin.) Morning, Ross.
Chandler: Yeah you are!!
Ross: Ahh, whoo-hoo!!(He runs back out the door.
Monica: (Comes up for below the covers and looks concerned.) Do you think he knew I was here? (Chandler quickly looks at Monica not knowing what to say.)
Monica: (In am uneasy voice.) Nope. (She chuckles uneasily.)
Chandler: So, ahh, how are ya? How ya...How ya... You okay?
Monica: Yep, yep...You?
Chandler: Yes...Yes..Uh-huh, You?(Looking over at her. She looks back.) We did you.
Chandler: Oh yea yea, absolutely.
Monica: (Scoots towards the side of the bed.) Could you not look?
Rachel: Ohhh.(she rhythmically taps her hands on the magazine on her lap.)
Passenger: Ahh, ahh, excuse me.
Rachel: Yeah?
Joey: Hello?
Phoebe: (Angrily.) Hey, were the hell have you been?!
Joey: Hey. I spent the night out. I met this cute bridesmaid. She is so...
Joey: Ohh great!!!
Joey: (Confused.) But, he loves Emily?
Joey: Okay.
Phoebe: All right, so, okay...
Joey: Hold on. Hold on. (Picking up a note pad and writing and reading the message aloud.) Rachel coming. Do...Something.
Joey: Right!
Phoebe: So tell me about this girl?
Joey: Hey.
Chandler: Hey.
Joey: Have you seen Monica?
Joey: (With a confused look on his face.) What?
Chandler: What?
Chandler: Oh my god!
Rachel: Ehh, pardon me?
Rachel: But he has to know how I feel!
Passenger: But why? He loves this...this Emily person. No good can come of this.
Rachel: (Sighing) Well I-I think your wrong.
Monica: Well, I love it. I only hope my wedding looks this good.
Monica: (Angrily.) You can let some of them go by!(Judy and Andrea go to the front of the chapel. Joey approaches Monica.)
Joey: Okay. (They both walk off to watch for Rachel.)
Ross: (Using a slightly different inflection for each.) I do. I do. I do.
Ross: (Very Nervous)Really?
Felicity: (In a sexy voice.)Hello Joey.
Joey: Hey, Felicity.
Felicity: Umm, I thought about you all day.
Joey: Yeah.
Felicity: Um-hum. Talk New York to me again.
Joey: (In a New York accent.) Fuggetaboutit. (She giggles.) How you doin?
Felicity: Mmm. (She pushes him up against the wall and they begin to kiss.)
Joey: Oh, yeah.
Ross: Dad!! (Emily comes running in.)
Ross: Nothing, nothing. Everything's under control.
Emily: What was all that about?
Ross: (Sighing.) It was...This disagreement over...(She sighs. Ross notices her in her wedding dress.) My god. You...you look beautiful.
Phoebe: Yea. Can I please, please, please talk to one of the best men? This is going to be the last time I promise.
Joey: (Smiling.) Ohh great!! (Putting the phone to his ear.) Hello. (He begins to escort her down the aisle.)
Phoebe: Did you stop Rachel?
Phoebe: So nothing got ruined?
Joey: No.
Chandler: What we did last night was....
Monica: Stupid.
Chandler: Totally crazy stupid. (He nods his head at the people seated.)
Monica: What were we thinking?
Monica: Oh yeah. Definitely.
Minister: Friends. Family. We are gathered to celebrate here today the joyous union of Ross and Emily. May the happiness we share with them today be with them always. Now Emily, repeat after me. I, Emily...
Emily: I, Emily...
