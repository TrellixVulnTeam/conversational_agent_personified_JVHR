Rachel: Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies? 
Chandler: I will have one. (Ross and him both take one.)
Ross: Neither will I. (they both put back the brownies.)
Chandler: See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
Phoebe: Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
Rachel: Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!
Rachel: And all these people actually died?
Ross: Thanks, Gunther. (takes the plate Gunther serves him and Rachel comes up and kisses him) (to Rachel) Hey! (to Gunther) Umm, can I get a napkin too?
Phoebe: (trying to bite into an apple) Ow! Ow! (drops the apple in disgust.)
Rachel: Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go.
Rachel: I promise.
Joey: (entering with Monica) Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?
Monica: You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
Ross: What? (to Joey) So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?
Joey: Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.
Ross: Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.
Joey: What did they do?
Monica: So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?
Rachel: Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?
Joey: Hey-hey, Ross?
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Hmm?
Ross: Joey, Homo Sapiens are people.
Rachel: All right, I like that. 
Monica: Okay.
Monica: Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!
Rachel: I cannot push it in!
Rachel: Okay, okay, okay.
Monica: I got it!
Rachel: Okay.
Monica: The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, (high pitched) rweee!!
Rachel: Or. We could put a hat on his head.
Monica: A hat! Yes! We need a hat.
Rachel: We need a hat..
Monica: Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?
Monica: Give it. Give it.
Rachel: Okay.
Chandler: Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?
Joey: Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.
Joey: Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.
Chandler: Why not?!
Chandler: What is the thing?
Chandler: (shocked) What?
Joey: They were in his office.
Monica: It just makes more sense as an ensemble.
Rachel: Right.
Monica: Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.
Monica: Sure, we have no money, go ahead.
Ben: Monica.
Monica: Oh my God! He just said my name! Did you hear that?
Ben: Monica bang!
Rachel: Okay, I heard that.
Rachel: Uh-huh.
Ben: Monica bang!
Monica: You okay?
Janice: Why are your eyes so white?
Janice: Oh my God!!
Chandler: All right!
Janice: How did you know?
Chandler: Joey told me, he saw you two kissing.
Janice: In the park?
Chandler: No! In his office! How many kisses were there?
Janice: Just those two!
Chandler: Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!!
Chandler: (giving her a bag) Here.
Janice: The receipt.
Joey: You said number two.
Rachel: I also said number one.
Joey: I know. (giggles harder)
Ross: (entering) Hey! Everyone.
Rachel: Hi!
Ben: Monica.
Ben: Monica bang!
Phoebe: Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is alive.
Joey: Uh.
Phoebe: What?
Joey: Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still. (Phoebe runs to the window and gasps.)
Phoebe: Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.
Monica: All right, we should call somebody.
Joey: Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food?
Chandler: Yeah.
Joey: Well, now we got a reason.
Chandler: What?
Chandler: All right.
Chandler: I talked to Janice.
Joey: Oh my God, is she going back to him?
Joey: What are you ah, what are you gonna do?
Chandler: Come on, tell me.
Chandler: What? (turns around quickly still ready to throw the dart and Joey quickly ducks and hides behind the chair) What are you, what are you talking about?
Rachel: (confidently) I did!
Rachel: I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!
Ross: Monica did it?
Ross: Monica?
Monica: Yeah.
Ross: Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?
Monica: No. Why?
Monica: Really?!
Monica: Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!! (runs into the bedroom)
Monica: (coming out of the bedroom) You jerk! You know how much I love that kid! (starts to chase Ross around the living room)
Ross: Monica bang! Monica bang! (runs into one of the posts) Ow!
Janice: Okay.
Janice: Wow!
Janice: What?
Chandler: Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!
Chandler: No. No! No! No!
Janice: Honey, honey, people are looking.
Janice: Good-bye Chandler Bing. (walks out with one shoe)
Gunther: Rachel has those in burgendy.
Joey: All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.
Joey: Okay, retract the device, retract the device.
Ross: He does not look happy.
Phoebe: (joining him) Love....
Chandler: I know.
Phoebe: I know.
