Joey: Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there. (Goes back into the hall)
Joey: (Returning carrying a couple of rusted lawn chairs) Huh?!
Chandler: Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
Joey: Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped! 
Chandler: Could we be more white trash?
Monica: (Entering from her bedroom) How desperate am I?
Phoebe: How come?
Rachel: (entering) Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?
Joey: Just pickle.
Chandler: Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.
Chandler: Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.
Chandler: (laughs) No. No!
Chandler: Well, not at first.
Rachel: What is she doing here?
Chandler: Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.
Rachel: Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!
Rachel: Chandler!! (He turns around quickly) Promise me, you will end it.
Rachel: Thank you.
Joey: Yeah-eh-eah! (Rachel glares at him) Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew what he meant.
Monica: Doing great, the quiches are coming along.
Monica: Yeah, I thought it was cute.
Monica: Let me ask you a question.
Monica: Why did you hire me?
Joey: No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there.
All: Nooo!! (Joey quickly stops nodding his head.)
Joey: Yeah-well-yeah! Yeah-oh-yeah. Come on in.
Monica: What?
Phoebe: Your nails.
Phoebe: And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!
Monica: Then why are you laughing?
Monica: Frozen lasagnas?
Monica: (interrupting) No! You have lasagnas! (Storms out and an awkward silence follows.)
Oven: Ding!
Phoebe: Op, the ruined quiches are ready.
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: Thanks.
Joanna: No, no, that was my boss. I have to go.
Chandler: Okay. (Starts to button up his shirt)
Joanna: What are you doing?
Joanna: Why?
Chandler: When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.
Joanna: Wait. I wanna show you something.
Chandler: What is it?
Joanna: (locking her door) Oh.
Sophie: Hi! I brought you back a macaroon!
Sophie: Yeah!
Chandler: Hi! (to Sophie) How are you?
Chandler: How little?!
Joanna: A couple of hours, I feel awful.
Chandler: Why not?!
Chandler: What?!
Joanna: Uh-oh, tunnel. (The phone gets cut off)
Rachel: (answering it) (angrily) What?!
Chandler: (in a serious, businesslike tone) Rachel, could I see you for a moment?
Rachel: You promised you would break up with her!
Chandler: I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!
Rachel: And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!
Chandler: It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.
Rachel: Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.
Rachel: Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it! (Grabs the key) You never see Joanna again!
Chandler: Never!
Rachel: You never come into this office again!
Chandler: Fine!
Rachel: You give me back my Walkman!
Rachel: Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!
Chandler: You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! (Rachel goes over and unlocks the handcuffs) Ahhh! (He starts rubbing his wrist)
Rachel: Does it hurt?
Chandler: No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. (He runs over to where his pants are hanging) Hello sweet pants!
Rachel: Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?
Chandler: About what?
Chandler: Well, this is much better.
Joey: He cut off his ear.
Phoebe: Hey!
Monica: Hi.
Phoebe: Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.
Monica: What?
Phoebe: Wow! My breasts are really strong. (She goes and joins Monica.)
Rachel: What if I clean your bathroom for a month?
Rachel: Foot rubs for a month!
Chandler: Freedom!
Rachel: Sophie sit!!
Rachel: No! God, would you just calm down!
Joey: How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?
Rachel: I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.
Chandler: No!
Chandler: With extra pulp?
Rachel: (happily) Yeah!!
Chandler: No!
Chandler: How do Monica and Phoebe know?
Rachel: Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous (Holds her hands far apart) or very (In a high pitched voice) stingy.
Chandler: (intrigued) Go on.
Rachel: Ohh, not compared to you. (Chandler nods in agreement)
Monica: Well?
Monica: Really?!
Phoebe: Oh, they love your casserole.
Monica: Yes!!
Monica: And you?
Monica: Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.
Monica: Wow!
Chandler: (hello) Hello.
Monica: (in a sexy voice) Hello, Chandler. (Phoebe has a huge smile on her face.)
Chandler: (to Rachel) I love you. (Kisses her on the forehead)
Phoebe: Oh. 
Chandler: (checks his watch) Two hours, that lasted!
Rachel: So did you break up with Joanna?
Chandler: I think so.
Ross: The volcano?
Joey: Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation.
Rachel: What?!
Joey: Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.
Monica: Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?
Joey: Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?
Monica: Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War? (Joey is pissed)
All: Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Phoebe: Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country.
Ross: With such a sad history.
Chandler: Could there be more Kims?
Joanna: Rachel, could you come in here for a moment, please?
Joanna: I seem to have had a slight office mishap. Could you please get the key off the back of the door for me.
Rachel: Oh, yeah! Yeah!
Rachel: Okay.
