Chandler: Ohh. Mmm.
Rachel: (Comes in the front door and walks towards the kitchen.) Hi.
Chandler: Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.
Chandler: (nervously) It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent
it to us.
Rachel: Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs.
Braverman downstairs. (Gasping) Thief.
Rachel: Why, why not?
Chandler: Because it's too delicious.
Rachel: Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.
Phoebe: Absolutely!
Phoebe: Okay. (Joey exits.) 
Phoebe: Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to
discuss the rest of you guys.
Ross: Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?
Phoebe: Duly noted.
Ross: Thanks. (Phoebe gets up to get a refill.) (To Monica) Oh! So for tomorrow,
do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?
Monica: What are you talking about?
Monica: You were invited?!
Ross: No.
Chandler: I used to undress my cousin Glenn. (Monica looks at him then
shushes
him.)
Phoebe: Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!
Joey: (entering) Hey!
Joey: Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!
Joey: Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for
sex!
Phoebe: Well, it does.
Phoebe: Okay, you wore me down.
Rachel: Hi!
Chandler: Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
Rachel: Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and
you want more?
Chandler: Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
Joey: Awww! Mel Torme died.
Ross: (entering) Hey.
Joey: Hey.
Monica: Hey.
Monica: Limited seating?! (Screechingly) I am just one tiny person!
Monica: Joan?
Ross: (interrupting) Not broad backed!
Monica: Why not?!
Chandler: Well, thank you for lunch.
Rachel: (gasps) Its still there! (The cheesecake they returned to Mrs. Braverman
is still lying in front of her door.)
Chandler: Mrs. Braverman must be out. (They move closer to it.)
Rachel: No that could kill her.
Chandler: But we should take it.
Rachel: But we should move quick.
Chandler: Why?
Rachel: Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
Chandler: Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! (Rachel grabs the cheesecake
and they take off upstairs.)
Monica: David who?
Phoebe: David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went
to Russia and broke my heart David!

Rachel: (taking a bite) Oh my God! That is so good!
Joey: (entering) Hey!
Rachel: Hey!
Chandler: What are you doing tonight?
Chandler: Dude! Dude! (Motions that Joey should pull up his pants.)
Chandler: Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
Joey: What?! Tonight?!
Ross: Oh here, I think this is us. (Reading the name cards.) Yeah.
Ross: (To Monica) Stop saying, "Blood" to strangers.
Monica: (to the couple on her left) So, how about you huh? How do you know the
happy couple?
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Okay. 
Joey: Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.
Phoebe: Huh?

Phoebe: Yeah!
Joey: Fine!
Phoebe: Yeah! (She exits.)
Phoebe: Hey!
Chandler: Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!
Rachel: (with a mouthful) Mm-mmm. (Nods no.)
Chandler: I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. (She tries to
whistle and blows little chunks of cheesecake out of her mouth.) How can you eat the
cheesecake without me?!
Rachel: Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are
you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are
dessert stealers! We are living outside the law!
Rachel: What?! What?!
Chandler: Oh yes! 
Rachel: Wait a minute!
Chandler: Oh yes!
Chandler: Oh yes! Oh yes!
Chandler: What do we use to split it?
Rachel: Okay! (Grabs a knife and cuts it in half.) All right, pick a half.
Rachel: Oh for God sake just pick a piece!
Chandler: (gloatingly and holding his piece) Ohhh!
Rachel: Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.
The Woman: Ross, sweetheart!
Ross: Oh, hey Aunt Millie.
Monica: Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to
mom.
Monica: Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you
like that?!
Ross: (to Frannie) Hi Frannie, congratulations.
Frannie: I believe you know my husband.
David: July. Umm, (He speaks Russian.) 
David: I-I do though.
Phoebe: I do too. (They kiss.)
David: Bye Phoebe. (He gets in and the cab drives off. Joey walks up and
witnesses that event.)
Joey: Anything I can do? Whatever you need.
Joey: I can give it a shot.
Chandler: Stick to your side!
Rachel: Hey, come on now!
Monica: Oh wait I forgot my wrap.
Ross: What? Oh, okay. Wait here. (Goes to get it, but before he gets there Aunt
Millie sits down on it forcing him to pull it out from behind her which gets her
attention.)
