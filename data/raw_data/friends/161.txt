Rachel: Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next?
Joey: Probably Monica and Chandler.
Woman: (to Gunther) Hi. Could I have a pack of Newport Lights, please?
Melissa: (Gasps when she notices Rachel) Oh my God! Ray-ray Green?! (Screams)
Rachel: (screaming) Melissa!
Melissa: Shut up!
Melissa: Oh shut up more! Now, are you friends with Ralph?
Melissa: (excitedly) Are you?!
Rachel: No.
Melissa: Listen, we-we have to have dinner. What-what are you doing tomorrow night?
Rachel: Shut up.
Rachel: Wow! What do you do now?
Rachel: Okay! (Joins the rest of the gang.)
Rachel: Shut up, that was my friend Melissa from college.
Ross: She seems really, really fun!
Joey: (excitedly) Who you what? Who you what?!
Rachel: (To Monica) Yes.
Monica: Wow!
Monica: (To Joey) They were lovers.
Ross: What?!
Joey: What?!
Monica: (To Chandler) Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.
Chandler: This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.
Joey: (entering) Hello!
Rachel: Hey!
Joey: Hey Rach. (Stares at her.) 
Rachel: Stop picturing it!!
Joey: Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?
Monica: Joey!
Monica: Oh please, you just want more blue pins.
Chandler: Well this is just sad!
Monica: All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!
Rachel: That is not a problem.
Rachel: Oh, get out of here! (Jumps back and walks away.)
Chandler: You mean like for award shows?
Rachel: Some of them.
Chandler: You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, "Who are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"
Rachel: Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!?
Chandler: Okay, who wore those? (Points to the tuxedos.)
Chandler: Not bad.
Rachel: He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while, have it on in the background. (Chandler nods and Rachel grabs another tux) Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan!
Chandler: Pierce Brosnan?
Rachel: Uh-huh.
Chandler: Are you serious?
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: Yeah.
Joey: We should really learn how to play the real way. (Moves another piece.)
Joey: Nice move.
Phoebe: Yeah.
Rachel: (entering) Hey!
Joey: Hey!
Phoebe: Hey!
Rachel: So Joey, I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding: do you need one?
Rachel: Well, what are you going to wear?
Joey: Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat.
Rachel: Huh. Does Monica know about this?
Rachel: Can I please be there when you tell her? (Joey nods yes.)
Phoebe: Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?
Joey: Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!
Rachel: It-it did!
Phoebe: Sure!
Joey: Hey. (Laughs, then seriously) It happened!
Rachel: Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and Melissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes! 
Phoebe: (To Joey) Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.
Joey: Why are you taking this away from me?
Rachel: Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!
Rachel: (shocked) Vanilla?!
Phoebe: Yeah.
Phoebe: To Ross.
Joey: Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.
Ross: Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding! (Holding up his garment bag.)
Chandler: A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
Chandler: What?
Ross: So?
Ross: Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.
Ross: Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.
Ross: When I got married you slept with my sister.
Chandler: That was pretty 007.
Joey: Hey.
Monica: (looking at him) What?!
Monica: Oh Joey!
Monica: Well, what am I going to say?
Melissa: Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?
Phoebe: Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.
Melissa: What one?
Melissa: (shocked) What?
Melissa: Yeah?
Phoebe: Really?!
Chandler: Ross is Batman!
Monica: Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.
Chandler: Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!
Monica: What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!
Chandler: Batman has a utility belt!
Monica: 007 has a fancy car!
Chandler: Batman has the Batmobile!
Monica: 007 gets all the ladies.
Chandler: Batman has Robin! (Pause) We get ESPN right?
Monica: How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?
Chandler: Ooh, yum! (Runs into the bedroom.)
Joey: (entering) Hey.
Monica: Hey.
Joey: Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?
Monica: The show?!
Monica: Have you ever been to one of my weddings?
Monica: The wedding starts at six.
Rachel: How can you not remember us kissing?!
Rachel: No!!
Rachel: Thank you Phoebe.
Phoebe: I know.
Ross: Hey!
Monica: You just carry that around?
Ross: Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece. 
Monica: A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.
Ross: Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.
Chandler: (standing up) Let me try it on!
Ross: What?
Ross: Let me see that! (Grabs the invitation and reads it.) Oh man!
Chandler: The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell. (Hands him the jacket and walks away.)
Joey: (entering) Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?
Monica: (defeated) Oh.
Joey: Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony! (Runs to his apartment and returns wearing a rather silly hat.) Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys, and then this (He tilts it to the side of his head) is for party time.
Rachel: It happened! I am telling you it happened!
Melissa: My God! You love me!
Rachel: (shocked) What?
Rachel: (moving away) Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Melissa: (suddenly frightened) Shut up!
Rachel: What the hell was that?!
Phoebe: I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.
Rachel: And?
Chandler: (yelling from the changing room) All right! I found one that fits!
Chandler: Whose is it?
Rachel: Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.
Chandler: Whose is it?
Rachel: Diane Keaton.
