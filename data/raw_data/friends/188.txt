Ross: All right! (Checking his watch) Yes!! From home to the hospital in under seven minutes! We did it!!
Rachel: (deadpan) Yes, the hard part is truly over.
Phoebe: Oh you made it!
Rachel: Hi! (Ross is stunned.)
Monica: How are you doing?
Ross: Wait a minute! How-how the hell did you beat us here?
Monica: We took a cab. Did you guys walk?
Chandler: Hi!
Joey: Hey! You made it!
Rachel: Okay. Just give us a second. Ross! (They walk away from the desk.)
Ross: Yeah?
Rachel: Give her some money.
Nurse: This is a hospital.
Ross: What-what?
Rachel: Ow! Ow! Contraction. (Sits back down.) Ow-ow! Ow-ow! (Starts breathing heavily.)
Nurse: Would you like to see a semi-private room?
Rachel: Oh, okay.
Ross: Thank you.
Rachel: Thank you. (Dr. Long exits.) Well, I guess we have some time to kill.
Rachel: Yeah well it looks great!
Man: Thank you very much.
Woman: Thanks.
Man: Oh no-no, not at all.

Rachel: Hi! 
Marc: Oh hi Rachel.
Rachel: How are you?
Julie: Hi. Is this your first?
Rachel: Yeah it is.
Julie: Well, little Jamie here is our third. So, if you have questions or you need anything at all, just holler.
Ross: Yeah.
Rachel: Oh.
Ross: Umm say, I-I opened this earlier (The privacy screen) but let me give you guys some privacy.
Marc: Yeah.
Ross: Oh, okay.
Marc: Hey! Smile! (Points his camera at Ross and Rachel.)
Ross: What?
Rachel: Here comes another contraction.
Ross: Oh. Okay, just breathe.
Marc: Look at this! (Takes another picture) There we go!
Phoebe: (looking at the clock) Oh wow, three hours and still no baby. Ugh, the miracle of birth sure is a snooze fest.
Monica: Hey, you wanna see something?
Phoebe: Sure! What?
Monica: Umm, this is going to be fun. Watch me freak out Chandler. Honey?
Chandler: Yeah?
Chandler: Okay.
Phoebe: Oh, this is fun.
Chandler: But you said you were ready too.
Monica: Yeah but I was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all high and weird like mine is now!
Joey: (voice all high and weird) What?! Are you crazy?!
Marc: I am so sorry. The doctor insisted on closing the curtain for the exam.
Ross: Uh yes! Thank you.
Rachel: Oh. Oh wait no.
Ross: Later.
Rachel: No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!
Ross: Oh good.
Ross: Mom no, come on! Thank you.
Ross: Gimmie! (Takes the ring and puts it in his coat pocket as Rachel enters the hallway.)
Rachel: Hi!
Rachel: Oh, thank you so much for coming. Ross, get in here!
Phoebe: Right. And with who again? (Ross exits.)
Phoebe: I know!
Rachel: New people.
Ross: What happened to the Disgustingtons?
Ross: Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?
Rachel: Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other. Including umm, evil bitch and uh, sick bastard. Oh God oh! Contraction!
Ross: Yeah? Okay.
Rachel: Ooh! Ow!!
Ross: Just ignore them.
Rachel: Ross.
Ross: What? What?
Ross: (to him) Hey! You wanna live to see your baby?!
Monica: Oh good God! If you want a baby so bad just go steal it! 
Monica: What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?
Monica: What?
Monica: We are pretty good.
Chandler: But nothing has to happen until your ready.
Monica: What?!!
Monica: Okay, hold on a sec.
Chandler: Period math?
Monica: Yeah.
Chandler: Yeah.
Monica: Well, we could start trying. Now.
Chandler: Right here?
Monica: No, not here. Maybe here.
Joey: Come on you stupid machine! Come on!
Phoebe: Oh, it ate your money?
Joey: (looking at her) No.
Joey: All right.
Phoebe: All right.
Joey: Hey I got one! I got one!
Man: Hi!
Phoebe: Hi.
Man: Oh uh, up or down?
Man: Could you press up too please?
Phoebe: Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.
Man: Car accident.
Phoebe: Oh.
Phoebe: Uh-huh, yeah.
Phoebe: Oh yeah! I-I would like that.
Phoebe: Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!
Joey: (standing behind her) Uh, you gotta press the button. (Does so.)
Woman: Oooh, that sounded like a bad one.
Rachel: Yeah it was.
Phoebe: Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?
Nurse: Dr. Drake who?
Nurse: A doctor at this hospital?
Phoebe: Hands.
Joey: 816, thank you! 
Phoebe: Thank you. (Starts to exit.)
Joey: And what is his name?
Phoebe: (coming back for Joey) No! (Grabs Joey and drags him away.)
Monica: I think we found a place.
Chandler: Okay. (They start kissing.)
Monica: Umm, wait! Do you want to set the mood a little?
Monica: Okay! Okay! Make me sterile, but okay.
Joey: Great! Go get him.
Phoebe: Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.
Joey: But you said he was this great guy!
Phoebe: But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.
Joey: You do attract some stinkers.
Dr. Long: Three.
Rachel: Oh stupid metric system!
Rachel: Oh for the love of God! 
Doctor: And here it is! (The baby cries.)
Rachel: Oh come on!!
Man: Dr. Wells is a woman.
Joey: That was a test. Good response. All right, full name.
Man: Clifford Burnett.
Joey: Date of birth? 
Cliff: November 16th, 1968.
Joey: Age?
Joey: Okay. And uh, are you married.
Cliff: No.
Joey: Oh really? So, 33 and still single, would you say you have commitment issues?
Cliff: Are all the questions this personal?
Joey: (checking the list) Yes.
Cliff: Yeah.
Joey: Hmm. Do you sleep with women and never call them again?
Cliff: No.
Cliff: No!
Joey: Oooh, wrong answer. (Exits.)
Rachel: Go get back on that case honey!
Rachel: Okay, well then bring her in.
Man: (entering, carrying a pillow) Hi sweetie!
Ross: (softly) Really?
Rachel: Oh!
Ross: Oh there you go!
Rachel: I get it!
Janice: What?!
Janice: Why?!!
Janice: Oh. Well then shut me up. (Does the laugh.)
Rachel: Just tell me how.
Janice: Uh-oh, I feel another one coming. (She makes a sound like a goose during the contraction.)
Ross: Sid you lucky deaf bastard.
Phoebe: What else? What else?
Phoebe: Oh. Ah-uh.
Joey: A widower.
Phoebe: Oh.
Phoebe: Enter Pheebs.
Monica: We could, or we can have sex in it.
Chandler: Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!
Monica: (lying down on the bed) Okay mister! Fertilize me!
Monica: Does that sound like Janice?
Monica: Hey!
Ross: Hey!
Chandler: Hi.
Rachel: Oh hi.
Janice: Chandler Bing!
Chandler: Jan-Janice!
Ross: Not just Janice, Janice in labor, contracting and everything.
Janice: Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis. You remember Chandler.
Chandler: What?!
Cliff: Wow! I usually get to know a girl a little better before I let her spoon me.
Rachel: Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God! (Starts another contraction as Dr. Long enters.)
Rachel: Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.
Rachel: What?
Rachel: My God. Okay. (Another woman enters.) Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker!
Cliff: Is this the same spoon that was in my cast? (Smells it.)
Phoebe: Huh. Okay, Mr. Perkazet.
Phoebe: Cliff, do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in your room?
Joey: Fake? Excuse me? Hello? (Taps the TV screen.)
Cliff: And then you tried to make me think that I was crazy.
Joey: Right!
Joey: Me neither.
Rachel: 3-2-1 oh!!
Dr. Long: Okay, the next contraction should be in about twenty seconds.
Rachel: Oh God twenty seconds my ass!!
Dr. Long: Here we go! Okay, keep pushing! Wait! I see something.
Ross: What? You do? You do? (Looks) Oh my God!
Ross: What is that?
Ross: Oh thank God, I thought she had two heads.
Rachel: Oh God. Is she gonna be okay?
Ross: Go!
Ross: Yes you can!
Dr. Long: Good!
Ross: (from the floor) Keep pushing!
Rachel: Are you okay?
Ross: You have no idea how much this hurts. (All of the women in the room turn and glare at him.) Keep going! Keep going!
Dr. Long: Here we go!
Rachel: Oh God!
Dr. Long: Here she is!
Dr. Long: Do we have a name yet?
Rachel: No, not yet.
Rachel: Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green.
Rachel: Hello baby girl.
Phoebe: Can we come in?
Ross: Oh, come in.
Phoebe: Hi!
Joey: There she is!
Rachel: Here. (Hands her to Monica.)
Rachel: What?
Rachel: I was reliving it.
Phoebe: Ohhh. (Hands her back to Rachel.)
Chandler: So then I guess Ferdinad is out.
Joey: What was the other one Ross?
Ross: Umm, Delilah.
Rachel: Oh great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.
Phoebe: Yay!
Rachel: Well what are we going to do?
Ross: Ugh, easy for you to say, you already know what your kids names are going to be.
Chandler: You do?
Rachel: Well tell us! What are they?
Monica: Take it.
Rachel: What?
Rachel: Oh honey, but you love that name.
Chandler: That was amazing.
Monica: I know. Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever? We may have just started a family. Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby.
Chandler: And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.
Janice: (entering) Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to say hello to his future bride.
Janice: Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?
Rachel: Really?
Janice: I hate to be the one to say it, but honey you two (Her and Emma) are on your own.
Ross: (entering) Hey Janice!
Janice: Oh hi!
Janice: Say hello to Aaron, your future son-in-law.
Ross: No-no. No.
Ross: Okay.
Janice: Bye. (Exits.)
Ross: Man! Did you see the kid on that nose?
Ross: Huh?
Rachel: (pause) Right.
Phoebe: Is she in there?
Phoebe: Oh!
Ross: Look at Emma!
Phoebe: I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.
Ross: Yeah, exactly.
Rachel: Nothing.
Joey: What is it? Hey!
Joey: Rach come on, what?
Joey: What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?
Joey: Okay, how long was I watching that woman?
Joey: Yeah, I guess so.
Rachel: I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?
Rachel: Joey. Honey what would I do without you? 
Joey: Sure.
Rachel: Okay.
Joey: My God.
Rachel: Joey.
Rachel: (seeing the ring) Oh my God. (Pause) Okay.
