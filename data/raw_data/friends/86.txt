Chandler: Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?
Rachel: Hmm.
Monica: Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?
Joey: Ohh, Nothing.
Joey: I know what it did! Nothing.
Joey: Like this. (Shrugs)
Joey: Sure! It flushes it.
Rachel: Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?
Chandler: (entering, with Janice in tow) Hello!
Joey: Hey! (Sees Janice.) Ah!! (Janice screams in surprise.)
Rachel: Guess who we ran into today?!
Monica: Janice?!
Monica: How have you been?
Phoebe: Ohhh, wow.
Joey: And there it is.
Chandler: Okay. Bye.
Janice: Bye.
Chandler: Bye.
Janice: Bye.
Chandler: Bye.
Janice: Bye.
Chandler: B-bye!
Janice: Bye-bye.
Phoebe: What?! I thought you were crazy about her!
Rachel: You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
Ross: Help! Help!! Help! Help!!
Emily: No, no, no Ross! Ross, these are friends of mine from home. (Introducing them) Liam, Devon, this is Ross.
Devon: Hey, mate.
Liam: How are ya man?
Ross: Oh hey, that was a good one, huh? (Imitating himself) Help! Help!
Devon: Do you realise that we have not seen each other since the night of that U2 concert?
Liam: (puts his arm around her) Well, actually the last time you and I saw each other was that morning.
Emily: Oh, Liam. (Ross laughs and takes her back.)
Devon: We were playing rugby.
Liam: Cheers!
Ross: Cheers!
Janice: Oh boy, I just love to sing!
Chandler: Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.
Chandler: Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
Janice: Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.
Chandler: I hear ya. (Pause) But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!
Janice: Oh no! Where to? (Gasps) Too Paris?
Chandler: No! No! Not, Paris. 
Janice:Too London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona?
Janice: When?
Janice: Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.
Monica: Done?
Phoebe: Yep!
Rachel: (entering, with Joey) Hey!
Joey: (to Rachel) I bet I stopped listening before you did.
Phoebe: Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.
Janice: (entering) Hey there Ross!
Ross: (shocked) Hey!
Phoebe: (whispering to Ross) Janice.
Chandler: Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!
Joey: Thanks for telling me!
Joey: Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.
Janice: Okay, Chandler, come on!
Chandler: (to Janice) Okay. (to Joey) Joey, trade lives with me!
Ross: Hey, I can handle it! All right?
Rachel: Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
Ross: And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?
Phoebe: Well, why are you doing this anyway?
Chandler: (from his bedroom) Thanks!
All: Oh!
Ross: All right.
Emily: Okay. (Goes to say hi to the lads.) 
Phoebe: (to the player) Hi.
Phoebe: Whoa! (The player leaves and to Joey) I kinda liked it.
Ross: Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all red! Red Ross!!
Joey: No.
Emily: (to Ross) Good luck, babe.
Liam: Ross! Ross! Come on! Get in here! (Ross gets pumped up.) Ross! Come on!
Liam: Ross, come on! Get in the bloody scrum! Ross, get in!
Ross: JOEY!!!!!!
Monica: He asked you out?!
Rachel: No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
Monica: Saucy!
Rachel: (refers to the table) What are these?
Monica: Electrical plans for the building.
Rachel: Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?
Monica: I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
Rachel: Wow! If only more people knew.
Chandler: Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
Chandler: What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
Chandler: (to the ticket agent) American Express?
Ross: Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!
Emily: Right.
Ross: (to Emily) Hey, could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottle of water? 
Emily: Okay.
Phoebe: Oh, poor baby.
Ross: (to Phoebe) Tell my son that I love him. (Emily returns with the water.) Excellent! Well, okay, I gotta have some more fun!
Emily: Ross, they are killing you out there!
Emily: All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.
Ross: No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
Ross: I like that.
Emily: Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle. 
Ross: Huh?
Ross: All right, bad ankle, got it!
Ross: Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!
Joey: The Red Ross! Okay.
Rachel: Hey!
Monica: Hi!
Monica: No-no-no, no!
Rachel: Oh my God! Look at this!
Monica: Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!
Monica: I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
Rachel: And did you?!
Monica: No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.
Rachel: Oh my God.
Rachel: Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.
Joey: Yeah, sure.
Ross: No, not you. (Emily gets it.)
Phoebe: Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice! (They go and get the coffee and the ice leaving Ross and Emily alone.)
Emily: You were amazing out there.
Emily: Oh my God!
Chandler: Well, I-I guess I gotta go.
Chandler: Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
Chandler: Okay, good-bye. Good-bye. 
Janice: Chandler?
Chandler: No!
Janice: Chandler! 
Chandler: Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!
Janice: No! No! I wanna see you take-off.
Rachel: Thank God.
Monica: I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.
