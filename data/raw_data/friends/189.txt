Rachel: Joey.
Rachel: (seeing the ring) Oh my God. (Pause) Okay.
Ross: Hey Joey. (To Rachel) Hey you.
Rachel: Hey you.
Rachel: Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
Ross: Uh Joey, can you give us just a minute?
Joey: No.
Ross: What?
Chandler: He pulled a quarter out of my ear!
Chandler: Okay. Wow.
Rachel: I know, I still need to talk to you.
Joey: Oh hey but, before you guys do that (To Rachel) I need to talk 
to you, and Ross, I need to talk to you.
Phoebe: (To Monica) Oh and I need to talk to you.
Monica: About what?
Phoebe: To see if know what these guys are talking about.
Ross: What about Ben?
Phoebe: (taking Ross aside) Have umm, have you thought anymore about 
you and Rachel?
Ross: Oh well yeah, actually I was going to talk to her when you guys 
all came in the room.
Ross: Yeah right.
Ross: What?! When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?
Phoebe: Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! 
That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV. Oh, that reminds me. 
That Mr. Hasmeje still has my Gameboy.
Joey: (taking Chandler aside) Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a 
second?
Chandler: Sure.
Joey: Dude I just did something terrible.
Chandler: That was you?! I thought it was Jack!
Joey: No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry 
me!
Chandler: What?! Why does she think that?
Joey: Because it kinda looked like I did.
Chandler: Again, what?!
Chandler: As we all are at some point during the day.
Chandler: Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?
Joey: I guess.
Chandler: And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how 
much he loves to propose!
Chandler: Well, what did she say?
Joey: (happily) She said yes.
Chandler: Does Ross know?
Joey: Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?
Chandler: If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to 
find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your 
ass!
Monica: I want a baby.
Monica: Deal!
Ross: I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute, are you gonna be okay 
alone for a bit?
Phoebe: Hey!
Rachel: Hi.
Phoebe: Are you all right?
Phoebe: Oh my God! He did it?
Rachel: And you really think this is a good idea?
Phoebe: Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks 
so.
Rachel: Really?! Even Ross?
Phoebe: Especially Ross!
Rachel: I guess so.
Phoebe: Although he does play with himself in his sleep.
Ross: Dad, what are you doing?
Ross: No!
Chandler: Hello sir, you know Monica.
Joey: Hey uh, is it okay to come in?
Rachel: Hey!
Nurse: Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?
Joey: (watching) Yowsa! (Looks away.)
Rachel: Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your 
mouth.
Joey: Dear Lord.
Joey: (To God) Are you kidding me?!
Phoebe: Oh hey! Wait up!
Ross: Hi!
Phoebe: No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!
Ross: What?
Phoebe: Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us 
that you were a doctor?
Phoebe: And so engaged. (Points to the ring that Rachel is 
wearing.)
Phoebe: Really?
Ross: No!
Phoebe: So whose ring is it?
Phoebe: Is it an engagement ring?
Ross: Yes!
Ross: No!
Phoebe: But you were going to propose?
Ross: No!!
Phoebe: Huh, I might be losing interest in this.
Phoebe: Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.
Phoebe: No! No, she said you actually proposed to her.
Monica: Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?
Monica: Daddy?!
Chandler: Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall.
Monica: Hey.
Rachel: Hey. I need to tell you something.
Rachel: Joey asked me marry him.
Monica: What?
Rachel: Joey proposed to me.
Rachel: Well, I-I said yes.
Rachel: I know. Days of Our Lives, thank you very much.
Monica: Well do you love him?
Rachel: Sure.
Monica: Sure?
Rachel: Yeah, I mean whatever.
Joey: No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she 
took her breast out.
Chandler: Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
Chandler: Okay, look, just do it gently.
Ross: Hey.
Rachel: Hey.
Rachel: Surprised?
Rachel: I know.
Ross: Joey proposed to you?
Joey: I can come back.
Ross: Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?
Joey: No.
Rachel: Yes you did!
Rachel: Well then why did you give me a ring?
Joey: No! No, and I did not ask her to marry me!
Rachel: Yes, you did!
Rachel: Yes, you did!
Joey: Ahhh!
Rachel: He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed.
Ross: Whoa! You were down on one knee?
Ross: Then what did happen?
Rachel: Yeah, what did happen?
Joey: Okay, the ring fell on the floor and I went down to pick it up 
and you thought I was proposing.
Rachel: Yeah, but you said, "Will you marry me?"
Rachel: Yes, you did!
Joey: Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your 
breast out!
Ross: Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!
Rachel: Well then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an 
engagement ring?!
Ross: What?!
Rachel: You were gonna propose to me?
Joey: Well, this is awkward. {See? I told you so.}
Joey: Dude, step up! I proposed.
Rachel: Okay.
Joey: Oh yeah, dude, I totally understand. Usually after I have a baby 
with a woman I like to slow things down!
Rachel: Oh my God!
Ross: What?
Rachel: Okay.
Ross: Thank you. (The nurse exits.)
Rachel: Oh wow, this feels weird.
Ross: Good weird?
Rachel: Wonderful weird.
Rachel: We really are.
Ross: Yeah?
Rachel: Yeah. (Laughs nervously)
Rachel: Yeah, maybe.
Ross: And you told Phoebe you were engaged.
Monica: (walking by with Chandler.) Hey dad!
Chandler: Hey.
