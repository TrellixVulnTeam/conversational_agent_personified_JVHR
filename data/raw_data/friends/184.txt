Rachel: Hi!
Ross: Hey!
Monica: Hey!
Joey: Yeah you are baby.
Joey: No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no.
Joey: Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.
Chandler: If only there was something in your head to control the things you say. (Joey nods his agreement.)
Chandler: Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?
Joey: Yeah.
Joey: Oh, not at all. Happy to do it.
Gunther: Can I get you anything?
Phoebe: (entering) Hey!
Phoebe: Oh. Finally! Oh. (Sits back in relief.)
Joey: (He goes into a song and dance number) 
Host: Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk, (Joey is in the background struggling to open a cartoon of milk) and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.
Joey: Oh, you said it Mike. (Rips open the carton and spills milk on the counter) Aw! There's got to be a better way!
Mike: And there is Kevin.
Joey: (finishing installing the Milk Master 2000) Wow, it is easy. (Starts to poor the milk) Now, I can have milk everyday.
Lauren: So this is it? Victor?
Chandler: Nice work my friend.
Ross: Uh, double latte, extra foam.
Phoebe: (interrupting him) I was just being polite!
Rachel: That is the Coast Guard. 
Chandler: (entering) Hey!
Phoebe: Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes! 
Chandler: Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?
Ross: (popping up behind Joey wearing an Indian headdress) Come on, it's fun!
Chandler: All right! (He joins them in the fort and comes up putting on a bonnet.) Isn't this a woman's hat?
Joey: Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
Chandler: All right, ready?
Joey: One.
Chandler: Two.
Both: Three.
Joey: Yeah.
Chandler: You wanna see if we still have it?
Joey: Yeah.
Chandler: FREE PORN!!!
Joey: Yeah!!
Chandler: We have free porn here!!!
Joey: Right.
Joey: Matter of fact, I do.
Joey: Uh, we stars just try to eat right and get lots of exercise.
Joey: Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?
Ross: Are you serious?!
Joey: Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
Ross: Wow! We are pretty good at this!
Joey: Yeah!
Ross: Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
Joey: Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! (Checks his pants.) Yeah, my pants are a little loose!
Ross: It tastes like feet!
Joey: I like it.
Ross: Are you kidding?
Joey: Not anymore. 
Chandler: Stick to your side!
Rachel: Hey, come on now!
Gunther: Your muffins. (Sets down a huge plate of muffins in front of Joey.)
Ross: (leaning into the recorder as well) Who just lost the respect of her unborn child.
Joey: Okay.
Ross: Yeah, so far nothing stupid.
Chandler: Mento?
Joey: No thanks.
Ross: Uh no, no just-just that he is a great guy.
Phoebe: Umm, Phoebe Buffay.
Ross: Yeah, you too.
Rachel: You too!
Chandler: Thanks.
Monica: Bye. (They resume their previous positions.)
Joey: How come you have two?  Chandler: Well this one's for you.  Joey: Get out.  Chandler: No, I can't. No-no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, (Puts bracelet on Joey) it's about you and me and the fact that we're (Reading bracelet) best buds.  Joey: Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.  Chandler: That's what they'll call us.  [The next one is from Episode 618: The One Where Ross Dates A Student.]
Rachel: Oh, Joey! Sorry!
Rachel: Really?
Joey: Yeah! Look! (He throws some of his spaghetti on the floor.)
Joey: I know.
Ross: All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and damnit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes (kisses Joey).
Joey: Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.
Joey: All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths. (He removes the waste bucket that's over the duck and the laundry basket that's over the chicken.) And they're off! (He puts his foot in front of the chick, stopping it from moving.)
Phoebe: Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
Joey: Judge rules, no violation.
Phoebe: Ohhh.
Joey: And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!
Phoebe: (turning from Ross.) No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!
Joey: Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.
Phoebe: Ohh, tough call.
Joey: Yeah.
Ross: Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... (Stops suddenly and turns to look at Monica) Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
Joey: Umm, no. No best friend, no. Just a lot of close friends.
Chandler: It hurts me. It physically hurts me.
Joey: What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!
Ross: Your make-up!
Joey: I think face to face.
Ross: I would say that.
Joey: Face to face, yeah!
Ross: Okay, here I go.
Joey: All right. 
Joey: Hey Pheebs! (He sits down next to her.)
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
Joey: Great nap.
Ross: It really was.
Joey: Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends who are. (Chandler and Ross look at each other.)
Phoebe: Oh, please!
Woman: (to her friend) He has the most amazing Porsche under there!
Rachel: Oh my God, Jill!
Jill: Oh my God, Rachel!
Chandler: Oh my God, introduce us!
Rachel: This is Chandler. (Points at him.)
Jill: Hi!
Rachel: And you know Monica and Ross!
Ross: Hi Jill.
Janine: No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.
Joey: Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
Janine: I don't think so.
Joey: Oh, I do. (Gives her the Joey-love look.) How you doin?
Janine: I'm okay.
Joey: What?!?! Oh dear God!
Joey: Oh great! Great! Thank you. (They shake hands.)
Joey: Bye-bye. (The interviewer leaves and he sits down with the rest of the gang.) I did it!
Rachel: Yeah!
Ross: Amazing! Amazing!
Joey: Oh, good to know. (The interviewer leaves.) So close!
Joey: Yeah, I called the lady about that. I told her I was just joking. She was pretty nice about that.
Joey: Little bit, yeah.
Ross: Wow! This picture of you sure is steamy.
Ross: Did you just wink at me?
