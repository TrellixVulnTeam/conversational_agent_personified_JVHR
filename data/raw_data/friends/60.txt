Monica: You gave her food poisoning!?
Joey: I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.
Phoebe: Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!
Monica: Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
Joey: I ran!!

Rachel: Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me. (Ross has a worried look on his face) What?
Monica: Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
Phoebe: You think you know me so well.
Phoebe: Yeah.
Monica: Okay, well I do know you.
Monica: Well so?
Phoebe: (singing) I stepped in something icky.
Rachel: Oh. (puts her hand over his mouth)
Phoebe: Oh, yeah!
Phoebe: I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.

Lecturer: ....oversized bracelets, oversized earrings, oversizing of accessories in general are very popular now.
