Chandler: Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!
Ross: People can hear you.
Chandler: I know!!
Ross: Yeah.
Kathy: Hi!
Ross: That is one good looking man!
Chandler: Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!
Ross: Dude!
Kathy: If you want it to be. 
Phoebe: Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?
Monica: Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why? 
Monica: Oh my God, are you out of a job?
Rachel: No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!
Phoebe: Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?
Rachel: Uh-huh.
Phoebe: That sounds great!
Joey: (entering) Hey! (Goes to the fridge.)
Monica: What are you doing?
Joey: I think I left a donut up here.
Ross: Hey!
Phoebe: Hey!
Joey: Hey!
Joey: (to Ross) That-that is a good trick.
Chandler: All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?
Ross: Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.
Joey: Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. 
Ross: Yeah.
Phoebe: Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
Phoebe: Oh-okay, I get the game now.
Joey: Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?
Ross: Oh yeah!
Chandler: Really?
Ross: No.
Joey: Noooo!!
Chandler: So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?
Monica: (entering) Hey!
Joey: Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
Monica: You made pancakes?
Joey: Yep! Grab a plate.
Monica: Okay. (She does so and starts to walk towards Joey to receive her pancakes.)
Ross: Oh yeah!
Monica: Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.
Monica: The players.
Ross: Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
Joey: All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!
Phoebe: Oh. (Joey flips the pancake and Phoebe catches it and throws it on her plate.)
Rachel: Hi!
Joshua: Anyway, she burned all of my clothes. I got away with two things. This suit and what turned out to be a skirt.
Rachel: Okay.
Chandler: Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!
Kathy: Hey you guys!
Ross: Hey!
Kathy: Hi! (Kisses Chandler) Thank you so much for coming again. Did you like it tonight?
Ross: Oh, absolutely! (Chandler mumbles something.)
Chandler: Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!
Chandler: Well, you can understand, given how we started.
Rachel: I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today, and I got to dress him up all day!
Phoebe: Rachel has a new doll.
Rachel: Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.
Ross: Uh, hello!
Rachel: Hi-e!!
Phoebe: Ooh, what do I smell?
Monica: Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!
Phoebe: Ooh! (They all go over to her apartment)
Monica: Please, have some!
Ross: Oh, yumm!
Joey: (Holding a magazine) Wow! The new Playboy!
Phoebe: What? What?
Rachel: Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there.
Ross: Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?
Ross: Oh, whatever. (Laughs and gives Joey the thumbs up heading back to his apartment. Joey follows him)
Monica: People are supposed to wanna hang out here!
Rachel: Why? Honey, what is the big deal?
Phoebe: Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?
Phoebe: Oh, are we gonna trash that place?
All: What?!
Ross: So you were right?
Ross: Chandler!
Rachel: Chandler, what did she say?
Phoebe: Wait a minute.
Joey: Come here.
Monica: Are you sure?
Monica: Nah, I got it.
Rachel: Hi!
All: Hey!
Phoebe: He just got a divorce right? 
Rachel: Hmm-mmm.
Rachel: No. Have you?
Phoebe: Oh, please!
Rachel: Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.
Rachel: Really?! You think that will work?
Joey: What the heck is that?
Chandler: Did she call?
Phoebe: No, sorry.
Chandler: All right, maybe I should call her.
Chandler: Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?
Ross: How might you be wrong?
Joey: Dude, tell me she actually told you this.
Chandler: She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!
Chandler: Oh my God!!
Joshua: What do you think?
Rachel: Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!
Joshua: Huh. (She starts brushing the lint off and checking him out in the mirror.) Yeah?
Rachel: Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. (She puts her arm in his and checks how they would look as a couple.) Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. (Pause) Umm, so you like it?
Rachel: Great.
Joshua: All right, thank you so much for all your help. 
Rachel: Sure.
Joshua: Well, I guess this is uh, I guess this is it.
Rachel: Yeah-eah-ha!
Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: Basketball!
Joshua: Wow! That would be great.
Rachel: Really?
Joshua: Yeah, that would be fantastic! My-my nephew is crazy about the Knicks! This is fantastic, thank you so much Rachel. (He takes the tickets and leaves as Mr. Waltham returns.)
Joshua: Hi!
Kathy: (opening the door) Hey.
Kathy: Yeah.
Chandler: Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!
Joey: Okay, for next time, what do you say?
Rachel: I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.
Ross: So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?
Monica: Just come. 
Ross: Oh my God!
Rachel: Wow! Monica!
Phoebe: Great!
Ross: This is beautiful!
Monica: Pretty much. (to Joey) So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?
Monica: You used to have carpet.
Joey: Oh yeah!
Ross: Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?
Ross: Hey!
Phoebe: Oh good!
Chandler: She is now.
Ross: What are you saying?
Phoebe: How? How is your fault?
Rachel: Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.
Rachel: Really?
