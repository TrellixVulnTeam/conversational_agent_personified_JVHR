Monica: Every year.
Phoebe: Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things. (just as she sits down).
Ross: Halftime.
Joey: Hey, who wants to ah, throw the ball around a little, maybe get a little three on three going?
Rachel: Oh! That would be sooo much fun!
Joey: Great, you can cover Chandler.
Joey: Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
Phoebe: Yay!!
Ross: What?
Rachel: Do you wanna play football?
Joey: Says who? Your mom?
Chandler: No, no, no, you say that proudly.
Ross: It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.
Monica: To score the winning touchdown, by the way.
Monica: (to Chandler and Joey) I won the game.
Rachel: Um, there was a Geller Cup?
Chandler: And was the curse lifted?
Ross: Can I see you for a second?
Monica: (shouting) Once!!
Rachel: Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.
Ross: Here you go. (throws her the ball)
Rachel: (knocking it down instead of catching it) That almost hit me in the face.
Joey: All right, we have to pick captains.
Chandler: And then Tineals.
Phoebe: Okay, so how do we decide that?
Monica: Okay, looks like Ross and I are captains. Okay, so um, I bunnied first so that means I get to pick first. Joey.
Joey: Thank you.

Chandler: (from the shotgun) Hike!
Rachel: Over here!
Rachel: (proud of her self) I almost caught that one!
Chandler: Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7.
Ross: Okay, (to Chandler) this play, I want you to do a down and out to the right. Okay. Break!

Margha: Mar-gha.
Chandler: Mar-haaaan.
Ross: Wow!
Monica: Wow, what?
Ross: It just amazes me that your still pulling stuff like this.
Monica: I heard that!
Ross: Well, I said it loud.
Margha: It is okay, if I stay and watch?
Chandler: Well, that went well.
Joey: I think so.
Chandler: Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number.
Joey: Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know.
Chandler: Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.
Ross: Chandler, I want you to run a post pattern to the left, okay. And sweetie..
Ross: Well ah, you wanna just stay out there?
Rachel: Can I see that for second.
Ross: Yeah.
Ross: Okay. Hut! Hike!

Ross: Before the snap!
Joey: After!!
Chandler: Before!!
Rachel: Now, does it really matter?
All: Yes!!
Phoebe: Well, okay, I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown. So?
Monica: Does so count!
Ross: Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.
Phoebe: Oh my God!
Ross: Oh-ho, okay.

Monica: Because the winner gets this!
Ross: The Geller Cup.
Chandler: Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?
All: Yeah.
Chandler: Okay, good.
Ross: Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!
Monica: When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.
Ross: That cup is mine!
Rachel: All right, so are we not having dinner at all?
Monica: All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?
Joey: What are you gonna do?
Joey: Okay.
Monica: Break!
Joey: Here you go!
Ross: Chandler! Chandler!
Chandler: (to Margha) Hi.
Monica: What?! I just touched him and he went over.
Ross: Okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough.
Phoebe: I love this game!!
Rachel: I went really long.
Monica: Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!
Monica: Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.
Rachel: I can not believe your trading me!!
Rachel: Are you gonna let me play?
Monica: All right then.
Margha: (coming over) The game is over, we eat now?
Chandler: No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?
Joey: Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.
Chandler: And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?
Joey: Nice try. (to Margha) See the Netherlands is this make believe place where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.
Margha: Oh, my.
Chandler: Fine with me.
Margha: Which do I like?
Ross: Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill...
Margha: Well, if I had to chose right now, which by the way I find really weird, I would have to say, Chandler.
Chandler: Yes!!
Chandler: Wh-what?
Margha: I now find you shallow and um, a dork. All right, bye.
Joey: Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
Ross: Save the breakthroughs for therapy, okay. The clock is ticking. We have no time, and we are losing, we are losing to girls.
Joey: This sucks, I was just up by that much!
Monica: Are we playing football or what? Come on you hairy-backed Marries.
Phoebe: Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!
Phoebe: All right, no, well I want to kill them to, but their boys, y'know how are we gonna beat three boys?
Phoebe: Come on Mon, let her throw the ball.
Rachel: Thank you! Break!
Monica: Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!
The Guys: One-Mississippi! Two-Mississippi! Three-Mississippi!

Phoebe: Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?
Monica: Let go!
Ross: No! You let go!
Monica: No!
Ross: Gimme the this!
Monica: Let go!
