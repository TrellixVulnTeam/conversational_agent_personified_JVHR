All: (groaning) Oh no! Oh no! (They all start to get up and leave.)
All: Okay! Okay! (They start to leave again.)
Tag: Hey, I wonder if you can see my apartment from up here.
Tag: What?
Ross: Huh?
Joey: Check out the rack on this chick! (Turns around to point it out to Ross and finds that Ross is glaring at him. So he quickly puts his binoculars to his eyes and starts looking for the comet.)
Rachel: Uh Pheebs, we just actually kinda wanted to be alone.
Phoebe: Shh! Get me out of here.
Rachel: Oh. (They leave, leaving just Joey and Ross.)
Joey: (whispering) Ross!
Ross: What?
Joey: Come here, check this out!
Ross: Show me where?
Joey: Right-right up here. (Starts looking at them through a piece of pipe.)
Ross: Joey!
Joey: (covering his ears and yelling) Oh no! No! No! (He starts banging on the door.)
Chandler: (whispering) Monica!
Chandler: I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?
Monica: It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
Chandler: What?! (Monica kicks him in the shin.) Ow! (He gets out of bed and heads into the living room.)
Ross: Rachel!! Monica!!
Joey: Come on!
Joey: Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape. (Points it out.)
Chandler: It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
Monica: Okay that does sound like fun. 
Chandler: Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
Monica: The second sister dies?!
Chandler: (Pause) No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.
Monica: The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?
Tag: Sure.
Rachel: Okay. (They start to head for the bedroom) Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?
Tag: What contracts?
Tag: Like what?
Tag: No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my desk!
Rachel: Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
Tag: You wanna go down to the office right now?
Rachel: Okay get your coat! (They get their coats and start to leave. Rachel suddenly stops and sticks her hand up the back of her shirt.) Oh! When did you unhook this? (Her bra.) Nice work!
Joey: Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!
Joey: What if I smack my head on the concrete?
Ross: Oh, all right. (Joey flips the coin.) Tails! (The coin bounces off of the landing above them and falls to the ground.) Can you-can you see what it is?
Joey: No.
Ross: Okay. Well, you be careful.
Chandler: (startled) What? What? What?
Tag: So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?
Rachel: In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a Post-It on it (Looks down onto her desk and finds the folder with the Post-It on it that contains the contracts she imagined she gave Tag) that said, "Must go out today." So you just keep looking in there! All right?
Tag: How could I have left them in the copy room?
Tag: Fine.
Monica: Are you still awake?
Chandler: Yeah! You?
Phoebe: Okay, this is where you and I part ways. (She drops the blanket into the chute.) Noisy bitch!
Monica: What?! What are you doing?!
Chandler: Do you know what just happened?
Monica: Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
Chandler: (turning the light back on) Monica?
Monica: What?!
Chandler: I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!
Chandler: Okay.
Monica: Give me the good stuff.
Tag: Still no luck.
Rachel: Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the drawers!
Tag: Do you want me to check again?
Tag: (smirking) Any luck?
Rachel: Can I see you in my office for a minute?
Rachel: You put these on my desk!
Tag: I did not!
Tag: How did you know they were in my bottom drawer?
Rachel: (pause as she realizes her lame attempt to shift the blame has failed) I am so hot for you right now.
Phoebe: Oh my God! How did you get back here?!
Phoebe: How do you know?
Phoebe: Fine! (She takes the blanket.) But please God; tell me how to stop them from going off!
Ross: Okay, do-do you have a good grip?
Joey: Yeah!
Joey: All right! Just hurry up!
Joey: I think face to face.
Ross: I would say that.
Joey: Face to face, yeah!
Ross: Okay, here I go.
Joey: All right. 
Ross: So what do you want me to do?
Joey: Well, just shimmy down me and drop!
Ross: Hi.
Joey: Hi.
Ross: (looking down) M-maybe I should hang and you can climb down me.
Joey: (angrily) Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
Ross: Do not rush me!!
Monica: That really was some of your best work.
Monica: I have to be up in seven minutes.
Monica: Really?!
Chandler: Do you wanna?
