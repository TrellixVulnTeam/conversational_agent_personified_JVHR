Rachel: Oh? Yeah! Sure!
Phoebe: (running out) Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you for just a second?
Ross: I know.
Phoebe: Ross?!

Ross: Hey! Hi!
Monica: Hey!
Monica: Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together.
Monica: Okay, come here! (Phoebe joins them in the hug.)
Ross: Bye.
Ross: Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?
Ross: What?! Why?
Chandler: (entering) Hey!
Monica: Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!
Chandler: (looking down) What gave me away?
Monica: No.
Rachel: Hey!
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. (Awkward silence ensues.) Seriously.
Rachel: I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!
Rachel: What?
Chandler: (To Monica) All yours babe. (Walks away.)
Monica: Have a seat. (They sit at the table.) Okay, listen umm, Chandler and I are going to live together, here.
Monica: Really?!
Rachel: And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!
Monica: Yes, we are. (Chandler is frantically trying to get Monica to correct her.)
Phoebe: (interrupting) Whatever! What about you Meg?
Ross: What?!
Ross: This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?
Phoebe: Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.
Phoebe: Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!! 
Karin: I am so attracted to him right now.
Chandler: Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?
Chandler: Okay. (She grabs a tin of freshly baked cookies) Oh yes. (He reaches for one.)
Monica: (slapping his hand) Hey!
Chandler: Hey-hey!
Chandler: I am now!
Rachel: (entering) Hey roomie!
Chandler: Okay, bye! (Exits.)
Rachel: (gasps) Are you pregnant?!
Rachel: Um-hmm.
Monica: Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.
Rachel: Okay. (Sits back and resumes her reading.)
Rachel: Sure? (Monica hands her one.) Thanks.
Monica: Maybe, do you need a tissue?
Rachel: Monica, where did you get these?!
Monica: I made them!
Chandler: Not once did we do that.
Monica: (entering) Hi.
Chandler: Hey!
Joey: Hi.
Monica: So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.
Chandler: Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
Russell: You got married again.
Ross: Yes.
Ross: Yes, second in two years. Third overall.
Ross: Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her.
Ross: This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
Russell: I see. Have you considered therapy?
Ross: I think just the annulment for today.
Russell: There are a couple of forms to fill out.
Ross: Easy.
Ross: No problem.
Ross: Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel? (Russell glares at him.) I will think about the therapy.
Rachel: Hey!
Monica: Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.
Rachel: Okay!
Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: (grabbing the star) What the hell is that?
Rachel: Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!
Monica: Something to remember me by!
Rachel: What is the matter with you?!
Rachel: It is? Really?
Monica: Yeah, sweetie.
Monica: No.
Monica: I know!
Phoebe: (to Joey and Chandler) Okay, bye!
Ross: Oh no.
Phoebe: So? Did you get the annulment?
Phoebe: I knew it! Because you love Rachel.
Ross: I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?! (He goes into her apartment.)
Rachel: Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.
Rachel: Thank you.
Ross: Of course.
Joey: So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?
Phoebe: Oh we do, but not just yet.
Joey: Really?! Well, when?
Joey: Wow.
Joey: Great!
Joey: Oh-oh, what about Ross?
