Chandler: (entering) Hey!
Phoebe: Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his
breath for almost four minutes! 
Rachel: (entering from her room) Pheebs, I wanna ask you something.
Phoebe: Uh-huh, what?
Phoebe: Oh!
Phoebe: Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?
Phoebe: My roommate.
Rachel: You have a roommate?!
Phoebe: Yes, Denise. Denise! 
Joey: Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is
she cute?
Phoebe: Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her
all the time! DENISE!!!!!
Phoebe: Hey.
Ross: Hey!
Phoebe: So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?
Ross: Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.
Ross: No. 
Phoebe: What do you mean, comforted her?
Phoebe: Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!
Ross: (grabs back his cookie) It was a hug!
Phoebe: Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?
Ross: S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?
Ross: (grabbing back his coffee) If the place you are referring too is being in
love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!
Joey: Hey! (To Chandler) Dude, some guy just called for you.
Chandler: Who was it?
Chandler: Sure!
Monica: No.
Monica: What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
Monica: Are you mocking me?
Chandler: Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
Chandler: (reading the ad) "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker,
non-ugly." Nice!
Rachel: This one? (Picks it up.)
Phoebe: It worked!
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Rachel: Hey.
Ross: Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?
Rachel: Yeah! Why?
Rachel: Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! (Jumps up.) Oh, thank
you! 
Ross: Okay, you go grab it!
Phoebe: I saw it.
Ross: Look, I do not re-love her.
Ross: You can live with me.
Rachel: What?!
Phoebe: What?!
Ross: What?
Rachel: Oh my God! Are you serious?!
Ross: Uh-huh. (Phoebe grunts.)
Rachel: Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has! (Kisses
him on the cheek and exits.) 
Chandler: Hi.
Monica: Hi.
Chandler: Really?
Monica: Yeah! Oh yes!
Chandler: Ohh.
Monica: Totally!
Monica: Oh good.
Monica: Changes?
Chandler: Is that a problem?
Chandler: In the game room!
Monica: Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
Chandler: Why did you take the shower curtain down?
Rachel: Hey!
Ross: Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
Rachel: No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
Ross: What?! Over a stupid room!
Monica: Ross, we can handle this.
Chandler: Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for
the love.
Monica: Love is the best medicine.
Monica: Why do you do it?
Ross: Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?
Chandler: Yeah, I do.
Monica: Yes.
Ross: (jumping up) Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!
(Storms out.)
Gunther: Oh, I was going to offer you my apartment.
Rachel: Why, where are you going?
Ross: (entering) Hey Rach!
Rachel: Hi!
Rachel: Oh wow.
Ross: Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.
Ross: Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?
Rachel: Well, because of us! Because of our history.
Ross: No!
Rachel: No?
Ross: No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you
still in that place?
Rachel: No! Not at all!
Rachel: Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.
Ross: Really?! We are?
Ross: Ohh! That would be great.
Monica: Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.
Chandler: Yeah, I'm not so worried.
Monica: Yeah, no, me neither.
Monica: You still want to move in together right?
Chandler: Of course!
Chandler: Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
Monica: Come here, I want to show you something!
Chandler: Okay!
Monica: Okay!
Monica: Uh-hmm.
Monica: Oh my God! I love that!
Chandler: Really?!
Monica: Uh, no!!
Phoebe: Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please
give me money so I can buy a computer.
Ross: (To Rachel) So umm, where are the other guys?
Ross: Fighting?!
Rachel: Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street
and make a copy?
Ross: Sure! Here. (Hands her his keys.)
Joey: Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good
idea?
Joey: I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you
again! Now, is that what you want?
Ross: Is that what I want?
Phoebe: (on the microphone, accidentally) Yes.
Ross: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!
Joey: (opening the door to The Potential Roommate) Hi!
Joey: Okay! Here we go. Pillow.
Joey: Very good! Okay. G.
Joey: Excellent! Okay umm, doggy.
