Ross: Hey you guys!
Phoebe: Hey!
Ross: Hey, what are you doing?
Mike: Oh, figuring out our wedding plans.
Chandler: That's funny, we were doing the same thing!
Ross: Yeah!
Phoebe: It's really crazy! The hall, the dress, the                            food... I-I had no idea how expensive this stuff was!
Chandler: Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked                            when I first heard the numbers.
Phoebe: So what did you two do about it?
Chandler: It was pretty simple actually, I came up                            with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a                            list and Monica told me to go to hell.
Ross: There's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna                            have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you                            a lot of money.
Mike: I heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar                            a year industry.
Ross: Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half                            of that.
Phoebe: But really, it does seem like this money could                            be put to better use?
Mike: Are you serious?
Phoebe: Yeah! Now, how would you feel if we gave all                            the wedding money to charity and we just got married                            at City Hall?
Mike: I think it would make me wanna marry you even                            more. (he kisses her)
Ross: I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible                            gesture!
Chandler: (to Ross) Maybe you do that next time you                            get married!
Ross: No, no, no. The next time it's gonna be a Hawaii                            at sunset. [pause] But maybe the time after that!
Joey: Hey!
Chandler: Hey!
Joey: What's going on?
Chandler: Our adoption social worker is coming by today                            so we are cleaning the apartment.
Monica: (sarcastically) We?
Chandler: You know you don't want me to help. You can't                            have it both ways!
Joey: Hey, is this person who decides whether or not                            you... get a baby?
Chandler: Kind of. She's coming by to interview us                            and see where we live.
Monica: And it has to go perfectly, because if she                            doesn't like something about us she can keep us off                            every adoption list in the state.
Joey: Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap                            opera fan! It's very impressive when the little people                            know a celebrity.
Chandler: (pointing at himself) Little people?
Joey: (pointing at himself) Celebrity.
Monica: Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless                            you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like... porn                            or cigarettes?
Chandler: What...? NO!
Monica: Chandler?
Chandler: (he stands up and he feels very offended)                            I don't, and I'm offended by the insinuation!
Monica: Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch,                            or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet                            tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?
Chandler: I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine,                            but that tape is not mine.
Monica: It isn't mine!
Joey: (going out with the VCR in his hand) Well, I                            guess we'll never know whose it is!
Phoebe: Yes. We're here to make a rather sizeable donation                            to the children.
Phoebe: Well, I think you're gonna appreciate it the                            crap out of this one (she gives him a check)
Phoebe: And we don't want any recognition. This is                            completely anonymous.
Mike: Completely anonymous. From two kind strangers.
Phoebe: Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.
Mike: Not necessary.
Phoebe: Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.
Mike: And "X" is spelled uhm... "Mike                            Hannigan".
Phoebe: Sure, I so glad we did this. It feels so good!
Mike: It does. It feels really good!
Phoebe: Oh, look! And we get these free t-shirts! (she                            takes a t-shirt which was on the counter)
Phoebe: Mhm... it's moist.
Ross: (he enters) Hi!
Rachel: Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!
Ross: Oh, good!
Rachel: Oh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and                            Charlie. I'm really sorry.
Ross: Oh, that's OK. I'm sure there are tons of other                            beautiful paleontologists out there.
Rachel: Absolutely.
Ross: There was one! She's it! All the rest look like                            they should live under a bridge!
Rachel: So, uhm... what are you gonna do today?
Ross: Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!
Rachel: Oh my God, what!?
Ross: Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to                            the museum of knives and fire!
Rachel: Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to                            the playground.
Ross: Be-caaauuuse...
Rachel: (upset) All right, well, if you must know...                            I had a traumatic... swing incident... when I was little.
Ross: Seriously?
Rachel: Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing                            and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the                            chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut a                            big chunk of my hair! (crying) And it was uneven for                            weeks!
Ross: (sarcastic) And you made it through that? I wonder                            who's gonna play you in the movie!
Rachel: Ok, fine! You can make fun of me. I do not                            want Emma going there. And I was thinking Claire Danes.
Ross: Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok?                            But the swings are perfectly safe, and besides Emma                            loves them. You know what, you should come with us and                            you'll see!
Rachel: Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour!                            Ok? When you're... and there is that moment when you                            are at the top, when you just don't know if you're gonna                            return back to earth!
Rachel: All right!
Monica: Oh my God, the adoption lady is early! 
Chandler: Ok, ok, here we go.
Monica: Ok.
Chandler: Here we go. Stand up straight. (smiling)                            Big smile. (opens the door and both are smiling exaggeratedly)
Phoebe: Hello, is this the creepy residence?
Monica: I told you! I am not coming to a naked wedding!                          
Phoebe: City Hall.
Monica: Ow! (Chandler slaps her on her back) Oh, that                            sounds nice! I am just there for jury duty. They really                            spruce that place up!
Monica: Yay!
Chandler: But you already gave all your money to charity!
Monica: Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way                            more important than some stupid kids!
Rachel: Ok, careful.
Ross: Ok.
Rachel: Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!
Rachel: Ok.
Rachel: Ok.
Ross: Here we go! (He starts pushing Emma)
Ross: See, I told you!
Ross: Oh, absolutely!
Ross: Ok! (he takes the camera and walks backwards                            to take a shot) See? Scared of swings, I bet you feel                            pretty silly (a swinging boy knocks him down) Ow!
Mike: Yeah! This feels really good.
Phoebe: I am sorry. I am, but this wedding is just                            really important to me.
Mike: She could have been talking about either one                            of us.
Laura: Hi, I am Laura, I am here for your adoption                            interview.
Monica: Hi, I am Monica and this is Chandler. Please                            come in.
Laura: Thank you!
Monica: Would you like something to drink?
Laura: Oh, water would be fine.
Laura: Your place is just lovely.
Monica: Ah, thank you. This building does have a wholesome                            family feel to it.
Laura: You know, I... I feel like I've been here before.                            Are any other couples in the                            building adopting?
Monica: Is that that couple on the first floor? Because                            we should get a baby before                            them. Yeah! That guy tried to sell me drugs. (Laura                            looks shocked)
Chandler: But other than that... wholesome, wholesome                            building.
Laura: Oh...
Chandler: What?
Laura: I just realized why I remember this place.
Monica: Really? What is it?
Laura: Oh, it's nothing. I went on a date with a guy                            who lived in this building and it                            didn't end very well.
Monica: Ohh... that wouldn't by any chance be... Joey                            Tribbiani?
Laura: Yes!
Chandler: Of course it was!
Laura: Yeah, we had a really great night and in the                            morning he promised he would call                            me and he didn't.
Chandler: RAT BASTARD!
Laura: So you're not friends with him?
Laura: Well, I'm sorry I brought it up. So, are either                            one of you planning on staying at                            home with your child... (someone knocks on the door)
Joey: (form the other side of the door) Hellooo? Anybody                            in there order a celebrity?                            (He starts to enter the apartment and Chandler runs                            to the door and shuts it back in                            his face) OW!
Laura: What was that?
Chandler: Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the                            halls here. He's great with                            kids though.
Rachel: Oh, oh Ross, oh my God, are you okay?
Ross: SON OF A BITCH! (turns to his right to see three                            kids staring at him) (To the                            kids) Oh relax! I didn't say the 'F' word! (They go                            away)
Rachel: Ross, see! I told you, those swings are evil!                            Alright, that is it. That is                            the last time Emma is getting on one of those things                            for her entire life.
Ross: No! No, no, no, no, okay, it wasn't the swing's                            fault. It was my fault and kind                            of that (point to the kid that kicked him) kids fault.                            Who is still laughing. Nice. 
Rachel: Ross, c'mon, please. Can we just get out of                            here, before somebody else gets                            hurt?
Ross: No wait, okay, okay, I have an idea. I want you                            to get on the swing, okay? And                            you'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of. 
Rachel: (looks at him suspiciously) I know what this                            is all about... You've always been                            jealous of my hair.
Ross: Look, I just think you're an adult, okay? And                            you should get over your silly                            fears.
Rachel: Alright fine. I'll do it.
Ross: Good.
Rachel: If you hold a spider. 
Ross: (He freaks out and starts jumping around brushing                            his sweater) WHAT? WHERE? WHERE?
Rachel: IF you hold a spider.
Ross: I know. (Rachel bends down to Emma and Ross looks                            over his shoulder again,                            afraid)
Joey: Guys? Everything ok? It's me, Joe...
Chandler: (Screams to interrupt Joey) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!!
Laura: What's going on?
Chandler: Oh, just like I said. That crazy... Bert...                            roaming the halls. (Joey bangs on                            the door again)
Joey: Guys!?
Monica: Keep on roaming Bert! We don't want any crazy                            today!
Joey: What's going on?
Chandler: WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG'S                            FINE!! 
Joey: Everything doesn't sound fine!
Laura: Is he alright out there by himself?
Chandler: Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother...                            Ernie.
Laura: Bert and Ernie!
Chandler: (nervous smile) You can't make this stuff                            up!
Mike: You never told me about that guy on your sweet                            sixteen. Oh, ugh. I'm sorry about                            that.
Phoebe: (Lightly) Oh! It ended okay. One of my friends                            shot him. 
Mike: Well, hey, at least you're getting a proper wedding.                            I mean, you really deserve that.
Phoebe: Yeah, I really do. You know, I had nothing                            growing up. (thinks for a few                            seconds) Just like the kids I took the money from.
Mike: No! No, no. I see where this is going. Don't                            make me go back there.
Phoebe: Look, I can't have a wedding with this money                            now. It's tainted.
Mike: Alright, fine. We'll give the money back.
Phoebe: And if that guy at the charity gives us a hard                            time, my friend hasn't shot                            anyone in a really long time.
Laura: Well, I must say, this seems like a lovely environment                            to raise a child in.
Monica: Oh, by the way, you are more than welcome to                            look under any of the furniture,                            because, believe me, you won't find any porn or cigarettes                            under there!
Laura: Oh! Well, actually, before we look around, let                            me make sure I have everything I need                            up to here...
Monica: (Pulls Laura into the spare room) Why don't                            I show you the baby's room?
Chandler: What the hell are you doing?
Joey: Well, you wouldn't let me in, so I thought you                            were in trouble.
Chandler: Well, we're not.
Joey: But you called me 'Bert'!? That's our code word                            for danger!
Chandler: We don't have a code word.
Joey: We don't? We really should. From now on, 'Bert'                            will be our code word for danger.
Monica: So that was the baby's room. (They come out                            and Chandler throws Joey behind                            the couch and puts his foot on him. Monica looks at                            Chandler)
Monica: (To Chandler) What room should we see next?
Chandler: Any room that isn't behind this couch! (laughs                            nervously)
Monica: (laughs nervously as well, Laura looks confused)                            (To Laura) Some people don't                            get him, but I think he's really funny! (She takes Laura                            to their own bedroom).
Joey: (quivering with anger) I did not care for that!
Chandler: (escorting Joey to the door) You have to                            get out of here. You slept with                            our social worker and you never called her back and                            she is still pissed, so she can't                            see you.
Joey: Ok, ok! (He leaves)
Chandler: Ok!
Chandler: What?
Joey: I forgot my bat.
Laura: Oh my God!
Chandler: And for the last time, we do not want to                            be friends with you! And we don't want to buy your bat!                            (Joey lowers his bat)
Laura: What are you doing here?
Joey: (to Chandler) Bert! Bert! Bert! Bert!
Laura: Are you friends with him?
Chandler: I can explain... Joey...
Joey: Uhm... ok... uhm... Well, yeah... You have got                            some nerve, coming back here. I can't believe you never                            called me.
Laura: Excuse me?
Joey: Oh... yeah... Probably you don't even remember                            my name. It's Joey, by the way. And don't bother telling                            me yours, because I totally remember it... lady. Yeah!                            I waited weeks for you to call me.
Laura: I gave you my number, you never called me.
Joey: No, no! Don't try to turn this around on me,                            ok? I'm not some kind of... social work, ok, that you                            can just... do.
Laura: (embarrassed towards Chandler and Monica) Well,                            I'm pretty sure I gave you my number.
Joey: Really? Think about it. Come on! You're a beautiful                            woman, smart, funny, we had a really good time, huh?                            If I had your number, why wouldn't I call you?
Laura: I don't know... Well, maybe I'm wrong... I'm                            sorry...
Joey: No, no, hey, no! Too late for apologies... ok?                            You broke my heart. You know how many women I had to                            sleep with to get over you? (and he leaves the apartment,                            leaving her shocked)
Laura: Joey, wait!
Joey: (acting sad) NO! I waited a long time, I can't                            wait anymore... (and closes the door behind him)
Laura: (laughing nervously) I'm sorry that you had                            to see that. I'm so embarrassed...
Chandler: Oh, that's really ok.
Monica: Yeah, that we totally understand. Dating is                            hard.
Laura: Boy, you people are nice... And I've got to                            say... I think you're going to make excellent parents.
Joey: LAURA! (and points to her, very confident)
Phoebe: (to the Charity guy) We're back!
Mike: No, no, we're here to give the money back.
Phoebe: Yeah, because you know what, it's... it's all                            about the children. 
Phoebe: Although... it's also about the wedding...                            Ugh, alright... here. (she gives the check and pulls                            it back again) No... Oh God... Oh!
Mike: (takes the check from Phoebe) Ok, look! Enough!                            Alright? I'm stepping in. I'm putting my foot down!                            As your future husband I'm going to make this decision                            for us. (thinking) Now... what do you think we should                            do?
Mike: What?
Phoebe: But... but... but we're giving you this!
Phoebe: (looks at the amount on the check, and gasps)                            Well, this is very generous!
Mike: Well, I mean... It sounds good to me. And that                            way we can save up, come back in a few years and make                            an even bigger donation.
Phoebe: Oh, is that you?
Monica: Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...?                            I can't wait to tell Chandler... Ok, goodbye. (hangs                            up)
Chandler: Wrong number?
Monica: It was Laura... She gave us a great report                            and we are officially on the waiting list.
Chandler: That's great!
Monica: Now we just have to wait for a call and...                            and someone tells us there's a baby waiting for us.                            Oh... 
Chandler: Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?
Rachel: Ok... I got a spider. There were two, I picked                            the bigger one.
Ross: (nervously) Ok...
Rachel: Ok... (and passes the spider to Ross who holds                            it in between his hands)
Ross: (Gasps and speaks at a higher pitch) This feels                            perfectly normal. Ok, get on the swing!
Rachel: (reluctantly) Ok... O-k...
Rachel: (more confident) Ok...
Rachel: whoo... ok... wow... ok... OH!
Ross: See?
Rachel: A-alright! I can do this.
Ross: There you go! Good for you! And you know what,                            I'm actually getting used to this little guy. I don't                            really even feel him in here anymore.
Rachel: That's because he's on your neck.
Ross: Well... (realizes, screaming like a little girl,                            trying to get rid of the spider) Whaa... aaah... aaahhh...
Rachel: ROSS!
