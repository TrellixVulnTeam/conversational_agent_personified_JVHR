Joey: Morning!
Rachel: Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?
Joey: Pretty good.
Rachel: Oh good. (She walks to the closed bathroom door, opens it, and finds a naked woman wrapped in a towel.) Ahhh! My God, sorry! (She closes the door and confronts Joey.)
Rachel: Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
Rachel: Hi.
Rachel: Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.
Rachel: Hi.
Rachel: (pause) Would you like some pancakes?
Ross: Okay, okay take a guess.
Chandler: The hot chicks?
Chandler: Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
Monica: She sent the chicken back again?!
Monica: Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!
Janice: How are you Ms. Hot Shot chef with the big fancy restaurant with the best chicken ever! (Does the laugh.)
Monica: Well, she saw the ring.
Chandler: Did she freak out?
Monica: Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people.
Chandler: Right.
Chandler: (laughs) You said no, right?
Monica: Huh?
Chandler: You said no, right?!
Monica: Well, she cornered me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!
Monica: Really?
Chandler: No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?
Chandler: Yes!!
Monica: Would it really have been that easy?

Phoebe: We want you to marry her!
Joey: What?!!
Phoebe: She is so amazing! You have no idea.
Joey: No idea? Who do you think brought her here?
Rachel: Cupid.
Joey: Man, do you know what guys want!
Phoebe: Yeah, but you always say that.
Rachel: Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.
Phoebe: Whatever.
Rachel: Fine. (They start to walk away.)
Rachel: Phoebe!
Phoebe: Secret affair!
Ross: People are doing it in front of my book!
Rachel: Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?
Ross: Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.
Joey: Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?
Joey: All right, so we should go catch our movie.
Joey: I like to see the previews. (Rachel looks at him.) The candy.
Phoebe: (entering with Erin) Oh. Hey!
Erin: Hey!
Joey: Hey!
Erin: Joey.
Joey: Erin.
Erin: Hey Rachel.
Rachel: Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!
Rachel: Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.
Phoebe: Oh no.
Joey: (skeptical) What party?
Joey: (still skeptical) Oh, and how old is Alison?
Joey: (still skeptical) Yeah, look how that worked out.
Ross: No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?! (The librarian brings his boss over.)
Ross: Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.
Joey: Hey.
Phoebe: Hey!
Rachel: How did it go with Erin?
Joey: Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!
Joey: Okay.
Janice: Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!
Monica: He might still show up.
Monica: Is that all?
Joey: How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!
Erin: What about Benitez?
Joey: What about Game 1 of the Series?
Erin: What about shut up?
Erin: Okay. (Joey goes to get some coffee and Erin sits down.)
Erin: Uh, okay.
Rachel: Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me that you like him.
Rachel: But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?!
Erin: Kinda.
Phoebe: Then change it back!
Erin: Yeah.
Rachel: Ugh, tramp!
Phoebe: Does Joey have any idea?
Erin: Yeah! That would be great!
Joey: (returning) Hey! You wanna go?
Joey: Okay. See you guys later.
Erin: Bye guys.
Rachel: Yeah, see ya.
Joey: (whispers to Phoebe and Rachel) Hey, thank you so much. (They both exit.)
Rachel: Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.
Phoebe: No, just a regular old flying dwarf.
Ross: Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?
Ross: Well I uh, I skipped forth grade.
Joey: Hey!

Joey: (coming back out) Finally!
Monica: What are we gonna do?
Chandler: I say we go with Careless Whisper.
Janice: Chandler?
Chandler: (To Monica) Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
Monica: Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?
Janice: (starting to cry) Do you have any tissues?
Monica: Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.
Janice: Okay! (She runs for the bathroom)
Chandler: No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!
Monica: Kinda like your barcalounger.
Monica: I never stop thinking about it.
Janice: Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath.
Janice: Why not?
Chandler: Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.
Monica: Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!
Janice: Why?
Monica: Because Chandler still has feelings for you!
Janice: He does?
Chandler: Say again?
Chandler: Feelings, such strong feelings.
Monica: I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.
Chandler: I just wanted to show Monica your book. (Ross just glares at him.)
