Rachel: (coming from her room) Hi, sweetie.
Monica: (airily) Hi.
Chandler: Are you, are you high?
Monica: I just had the most amazing bath.
Monica: Wait, you like them with me.
Monica: Oh, baths are so relaxing!
Chandler: Really? What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth.
Joey: (entering) Hey, Chandler, you got a minute? I-I really need to talk to you.
Chandler: Oh! Uh, yeah! Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?
Joey: Well, neither.
Chandler: Do you?
Joey: It was different for you guys! I mean, I mean, you were both in the same place, right?
Chandler: In London?
Joey: Yeah.
Chandler: Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.
Joey: You know what? This is a bad idea. Forget it. Forget it, and listen, do me a favor, this conversation was between you and me.
Chandler: If that.
Ross: Right.
Phoebe: Hey, are you going to find out the sex of the baby?
Rachel: Yep! Happy and healthy! And cute!
Ross: And smart!
Rachel: Popular.
Ross: With an aptitude for science.
Phoebe: Are you two talking about the same baby? Hey! Have you started off thinking of names yet?
Ross: Really? Me too!
Phoebe: Me too!
Rachel: Really?!
Rachel: Okay fine, what do you have?
Rachel: Wow, oh my God, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard.
Phoebe: Yeah, by Sandrine.
Phoebe: How-how about you each get five vetoes?
Ross: All right.
Rachel: All right.
Ross: That sounds fair.
Ross: Veto.
Rachel: Why?
Ross: Rain? Hi. Hi, my name is Rain. I have my own kiln, and my dress is made out of wheat.
Phoebe: I know her! I bought homemade soap from her at a Dead show!
Ross: Okay, how about, for a guy, Thatcher?
Rachel: Ross, why do you hate our child?
Ross: Fine, you go.
Rachel: Okay, James.
Ross: Huh.
Ross: Veto. Stewart?
Rachel: Veto. Sawyer?
Ross: Veto. Helen?
Rachel: Veto.
Phoebe: Is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good?
Chandler: Hey.
Monica: Boy, do I have a surprise for you!
Chandler: Sex on the balcony?
Chandler: What is it?
Monica: I drew you a bath!
Chandler: Well, this does butch it up a bit.
Monica: I swear, if you try it, you will love it!
Chandler: All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?
Monica: Absolutely.
Monica: (entering) So?
Chandler: Oh my God.
Monica: I told you you were a bath person! Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you a facial!
Rachel: Oh, oh my God! I can practically hear the mahjong tiles!
Dr. Long: Okay! All your tests look fine. Now, are you two interested in knowing the sex of the baby?
Ross: No, no, we want to wait, right?
Rachel: Right. Right.
Rachel: (looking at the bulletin board with baby pictures) So, which of these babies do you think is the ugliest?
Rachel: Third one from the left?
Rachel: What?! 
Ross: I saw you!
Ross: Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!
Rachel: (holding stomach) Okay, a couple months late on the lecture, Ross.
Monica: Hello?
Monica: What?
Chandler: Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!
Chandler: I had the exact same conversation.
Monica: You did? What was he talking about?
Monica: (groans) That was a long night.
Monica: Okay, he was talking about rules.
Chandler: Uh-huh.
Monica: Umm, and looking at people differently.
Monica: What did he tell you?
Chandler: He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.
Monica: Okay. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone.
Chandler: But what did he mean by rules?
Monica: Wait a minute! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in!
Chandler: Because he was looking at her differently.
Monica: And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!
Chandler: My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!
Phoebe: (from outside the bathroom) You guys?
Monica: Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives! And they would have me to thank, and we could all start having babies?
Monica: You just stay here! (Dumps a jar of bath salts in the bathtub)
Chandler: Oh, God!
Phoebe: Oh, hey, Monica, I brought back your iron.
Monica: Oh, you had that? 
Phoebe: Uh-huh.
Monica: I thought I lost it. I got a new one, like, a month ago.
Phoebe: Oh, just as well, I broke this one.
Phoebe: What?
Monica: Nothing.
Phoebe: Okay.
Phoebe: Fine.
Monica: Somebody likes you!
Phoebe: (Groans) Is it Chandler?
Monica: No!
Phoebe: Well, then tell him to stop staring!
Monica: Not Chandler, just Joey.
Phoebe: Sure.
Rachel: Hey.
Ross: Hey.
Ross: Veto.
Rachel: Fine.
Rachel: But Ross, you want the name Ruth!
Ross: Not like this!
Phoebe: Hey.
Phoebe: Umm, Joey, I know.
Joey: What?
Phoebe: I knooow.
Joey: Whaaat?
Phoebe: I know about your feelings.
Joey: Oh my God. You do?
Phoebe: Yeah.
Joey: You think?
Joey: Not really.
Phoebe: Mm-hmm. (To herself) Throw me a bone here.
Rachel: What?
Rachel: A what?!
Ross: No.
Ross: No.
Rachel: You said girl!
Ross: Permission to veto.
Rachel: Yes, please.
Monica: Hey.
Chandler: Do I smell essential oils?
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: L-leaving my troubles behind?
Chandler: (upset) Hey!
Phoebe: Hi, Bubbles. Manly. Well, I just thought I would drop by and let you know how it went with Joey.
Chandler: (To Monica) You told her?!
Monica: What?
Phoebe: Really? Lee Majors is hot!
Joey: (from outside the bathroom) Hello?
Joey: Why?
Joey: (entering the bathroom) What are you guys doing in here?
Chandler: You like Rachel?!
Phoebe: (checking for herself) (To Monica) Mazel tov.
Rachel: (entering) Hey! Ross and I were looking for you! What are we all doing in here? (Looks at Chandler) Oh, my! (Covers the spot where Joey wants bubbles to be replaced.)
Monica: Honey, cover it up with the boat!
Ross: (from outside the bathroom) Hello?
Rachel: No, I was waiting for you!
Phoebe: Tell us what?
All: Oh, wow! Yay! Wow! Hooray! Oh, man!
Rachel: (entering) Hi, sweetie.
Joey: (thinking) I love you.
Chandler: Oh, sweet Lord. New realms of pleasure!
Monica: (To herself) Whatever keeps you off the balcony, big guy!
