Rachel: Okay, Chandler!
Chandler: Okay.
Rachel: And your horoscope says, "On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift."
Chandler: (To Monica) Oh, well thank you in advance. (Kisses her.)
Monica: (To Chandler) You are going to make a joke about my special present! Why would you do that?!
Rachel: Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.
Joey: (entering) Hey guys!
Chandler: Hey!!
Rachel: Be-because the last one was such a big seller?
Phoebe: Well, if you must know I have written 14 books. And as I am the only one who has read them, I can tell you that they all have been very well received. 
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Chandler: Hey!
Rachel: Hey!
Ross: What are you guys doing later?
Phoebe: Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut.
Rachel: (To Phoebe) We do?
Phoebe: I want to see what he wants first.
Rachel: Okay.
Ross: Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me. It-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good.
Ross: Thanks!
Monica: We know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be.
Joey: Wow! Huh? (Picks up the phone) Mac Macaveli, Private Investigator!
Joey: Okay. Hey uh, when do I get to meet the robot?
Joey: Okay.
Joey: (slaps Wayne on his cheek) How do you do there, Wayne? (Backs away.)
Wayne: C.H.E.E.S.E. is right here. (He puts on his headset, picks up the controller, and wheels C.H.E.E.S.E. in. C.H.E.E.S.E. is just a plain old robot on tracks; he kinda looks like No. 5 in the movie Short Circuit.)
Joey: (laughs) This is like the temporary robot, right?
Wayne: No. Why?
Elizabeth: This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller.
Ross: Of course, of course, Mr. Stevens.
Paul: So Ross, what your problem?
Ross: Okay. I can, I can see that. Umm, but I think if you give me umm, one chance I can, I can change your mind.
Paul: Okay.
Ross: What?
Elizabeth: Daddy!
Paul: Fine! Two minutes. Go.
Paul: (laughs then checking his watch) 1 minute 50 seconds.
Ross: And the Irish guy wins the joke!
Monica: Ross!!
Chandler: Ross!
Monica: (obviously attracted to him) Is-is-is there a-a Mrs. Stevens?
Paul: I get that a lot.
Phoebe: Yeah. Not looking for dates. (Monica turns in horror.)
Paul: I had a sister.
Monica: Ohh!
Paul: She passed away.
Paul: A part of him did yes.
Ross: (returning with the coffee) Okay here we are Paul, Elizabeth. (He sets down their cups.) So I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.
Rachel: Oh! Ross is sooo great!
Chandler: Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.
Monica: No, you said the baby creeps you out.
Chandler: No, the little girl creeps me out.
Monica: You said the baby.
Chandler: Why would the baby creep me out?
Monica: Why would the little girl creep you out?
Chandler: This is going in your book?
Monica: What?! Excuse me!
Rachel: (seeing him) Oh hi!
Paul: No.
Rachel: All right! (Throws them back under the cushion.)
Paul: Oh, here they are right here. (Picks them up from underneath the corner of the couch.)
Rachel: Oh good.
Paul: Thanks for your help. (Starts to leave.)
Rachel: (chasing after him) Oh, wait! Sorry, Mr. Paul? Mr. Paul?
Paul: Just call me Paul.
Rachel: Paul. Umm, I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy.
Paul: Well maybe you can date him then that would save me the trouble of killing him. (Rachel laughs then starts looking at him.) Are you okay?
Paul: Well, we were very young when we had her.
Rachel: Oh. We?
Rachel: (sympathetic) Ohh. So you raised her all on your own?
Paul: Yes I did.
Rachel: Ohh. (She touches his arm for support and likes what she feels) Ooh!
Joey: Hey!
Chandler: Hey!
Phoebe: Hey!
Monica: How was your first day?
Joey: Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.
Joey: Wow!
Estelle: Uh-oh!
Ross: Joey?!
Paul: Hi Ross.
Rachel: I was just getting him to like you.
Ross: Joey?! Joey!! (He runs into his bedroom.)
Rachel: Ross, Joey is not here.
Paul: Sure you did! You came in, you got all awkward, and you ran into the bedroom. You were shouting, "Joey! Joey!" Bye Rach. (Kisses her.)
Rachel: Bye!
Ross: (incredulous) In your mouth?!
Ross: You were at the coffeehouse!
Ross: That was different!
Rachel: What? Why?!
Ross: This is weird for me!
Ross: How is that important?
Joey: Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
Chandler: Yeah, you wish. (Stops to think about it and gets depressed.)
Phoebe: (writing in her book) "You wish."
Monica: Phoebe, stop writing about us!
Chandler: Who?
Phoebe: Marcia and Chester.
Chandler: Hmm.
Monica: (writing on a piece of paper) Phyllis is sitting in a chair.
Chandler: Oh.
Chandler: Oh-oh.
Phoebe: Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter!
Rachel: So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me.
Elizabeth: What a nice story!
Paul: So Ross was in college and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her high school prom.
Ross: Yeah, take your time. 
Ross: Not all bad.
Ross: Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too.
Paul: I beg your pardon?
Paul: You have a son?
Rachel: Oh we were, but that was just a (pause as the audience reacts), I mean that was just a big drunken mistake.
Paul: You two were married?!
Monica: Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.
Chandler: We said seven!
Monica: We said six!
Phoebe: (Turning around in the chair) Hi!
Chandler: Oh my good God.
Monica: Ugh!
Phoebe: I know what time you said.
Chandler: What?!
Phoebe: Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.
Monica: What time?
Chandler: (disgusted) What does it say?!
Phoebe: I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
Chandler: Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything.
Phoebe: Thanks! So are you.
Chandler: So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!
Monica: Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!
Phoebe: (writing in her book) Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.
Joey: Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
Wayne: Hey Joey, I want to talk to you.
Chandler: Hi, how are ya?
Joey: (incredulous) Why should I help you?!
Joey: (happily) What do you need?
Joey: Yeah?
Wayne: I wish I could talk to her.
Joey: What are you in love with her or something?
Wayne: Yeah. Her. All of them. Anyone.
Wayne: Listen, I-I guarantee you keep your job if you can teach me how to talk to women like you do.
Rachel: I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.
Paul: How to make the next one even shorter?
Paul: Well, this is fun. So Ross, did you kill any of these wives?
Paul: Are you yelling at me?!
Ross: God no!
Paul: Really?! (She nods in the affirmative.)
Paul: Then we agree?
Paul: Neither of us like Ross!
Elizabeth: I like Ross.
Ross: Ohhh! Kids!
Rachel: (returning) Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is!
Joey: Well, it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E.
