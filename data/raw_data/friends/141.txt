Monica: Hi guys.
Chandler: (To Monica) You are beautiful.
Phoebe: Here.
Rachel: Oh! Thank you!
Rachel: Uh well, uh this is a silent auction. They lay out all the stuff here and then you write down your offer and then the highest bid gets it.
Rachel: (suddenly worried) Uh, wh-why?
Rachel: Oh, hi!
Phoebe: Oh, hi. (They shake hands.)
Joey: (behind them) Oh!! Shrimp toast! (Walks right past the little group on his way for the shrimp toast.)
Rachel: Yeah.
Zoe: Shut the door! Shut the door!! (Runs over and closes the door.)
Elizabeth: The guys across the hall are throwing water balloons at us.

Sarah: (approaching with two filled balloons in her hands) Nobody! We put them in here! (Indicates the aforementioned balloons causing both of them to scream in delight and start drinking from the balloons.)
Elizabeth: (To Ross) You want some?! (Starts to squirt the Kamikaze at him.)
Ross: No! Okay! Okay! (Stops her.) Okay, look, can I, can I just-just talk to you for a second?
Elizabeth: Yeah, sure.
The Girls: You put your balloons down!!
Ross: (screaming) Everybody put their balloons down!!! (There is a temporary cease fire.) Now this is a nice suit!! (Shows everyone where he was hit.)
Rachel: Ugh! So close!
Phoebe: Hey you guys! Look! 
Joey: Hey!
Phoebe: I got me some drinks!
Rachel: What are you doing?
Phoebe: Open bar!
Joey: I won! That was my guess!
Rachel: What?! What?! What?!
Joey: I guessed 20,000!
Rachel: Joey! Sit down! (Pulls him down.)
Phoebe: Forget her! You enjoy this!! (Pulls him back up and starts applauding again. Joey waves and does a salute.] 
Monica: What are you doing?

Chandler: Hi.
Chandler: Richard! No one supposed to know about us! (Richard just smiles at him.) See I, did it again.
Richard: Oh. Good to see you guys.
Richard: That might be fun. (Richard and Lisa sit down.)
Rachel: What were you thinking?!
Rachel: Wh?!
Joey: I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!
Rachel: Why would a charity give away a free boat?!
Rachel: Ugh!
Rachel: How is you drinking helping the kids?
Phoebe: Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.
Joey: Oh hi!
Joey: Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?
Rachel: Joey! Joey, good one! (Mr. Thompson starts to laugh.)
Joey: Okay.
Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: Not great.
Richard: And-and then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in.
Lisa: (laughing) Oh my God!
Chandler: I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.
Monica: Ohh.
Chandler: What?!
Chandler: (stopping him from going any further) Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
Ross: Who?
Chandler: Richard!
Chandler: Oh you knew that. Good!
Monica: I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
Ross: Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
Ross: Hmm.
Chandler: For camp!
Joey: Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one.
Rachel: Oh great!
Joey: (To Phoebe) Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.
Phoebe: Oh, okay.
Rachel: (To Phoebe) Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?
Phoebe: Oh, en chante. (She holds out her hand for him to kiss it, but he only shakes it.) 
Joey: Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?

Joey: Chandler giving you a hard time huh?
Joey: Well, you know Chandler.
Joey: Maybe you changed?
