Rachel: Phoebe?
Phoebe: Yeah?
Rachel: Look at that guy by the window, wow!
Phoebe: Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?
Rachel: Yeah.
Phoebe: This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start
going crazy.
Rachel: Really?! So this has happened to you?
Phoebe: Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander
Holyfield from a Foot Locker.
Rachel: Ah.
Phoebe: Yeah.
Mona: Hey! (To Joey) Hey!
Ross: Hi!
Mona: Hi! Look! I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center.
Ross: Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona
ice skating?
Ross: Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us
together?
Mona: Oh yeah, probably at the end. (Flips to the end.) Oh my God! He only took
pictures of my breasts!
Ross: (pause) Together? Like-like to people?
Ross: Okay. (Not happy about it.)
Mona: Oh, I gotta get to work. So call me later?
Ross: Uh sure, sure.
Mona: Bye guys.
Phoebe: Bye.
Joey: (To Ross) Congratulations! You just got married!
Ross: I know. Can you believe that?
Ross: Married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have
been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?!
Doug: Bing! Ho! And the Bing-ette!
Chandler: Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?
Monica: Yes, hi.
Doug: Hi. So good news, the divorce is final. I signed the papers this A.M.
Doug: Sorry? Finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap. Hey, congratulations
to you guys though!
Monica: No leg-chewing for us sir.
Doug: Tomorrow night it is then, I should be out of court by six. They keep
throwing these sexual harassment cases at me and I keep knocking them out of the park!
Chandler: No.
Mona: Hi!
Ross: Hey!
Mona: Hey, I went by the photo shop, take a look, here is a mockup of our card.
What do you think?
Ross: Huh. Wow, this is great.
Mona: Now, do you think it should say, "Love Ross and Mona?"
Mona: Really? Why not?
Ross: Yeah.
Mona: Where are we?
Ross: Huh.
Mona: What?
Ross: Really?! I mean, even with the card?
Nurse: Hi!
Rachel: Hi!
Rachel: Yes, you are.
Rachel: Oh, really, really good. But enough about me, come on! Where-where are
you from? What do you do?
Rachel: Right! Right! I-I actually meant in your spare time, do you cook? Do you
ski? Or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend?
Rachel: Oh, I love to ski! How amazing is this?!
Rachel: No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!
Rachel: Well would you like me to lie down on the table?
Rachel: Do you feel it too?
Rachel: Hi.
Phoebe: Oh my God.
Monica: Why did you do that?
Phoebe: Okay, remember that little problem I was having during my
fourth month of
pregnancy?
Monica: Oh yeah, the Evander Holyfield phase. Oh man you were so hard up you
practically came on to me.
Phoebe: You wish.
Phoebe: Oh yeah? Come and get it.
Rachel: Okay, even this is turning me on!
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Monica: You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?
Phoebe: Ugh! Women!
Ross: I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I
mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, "So, where is this going?"
Rachel: Uh Ross? You asked me that.
Monica: Like asking her to move in with you?
Ross: Smaller than that.
Monica: Making her a mixed tape?
Ross: Uh, bigger than that.
Phoebe: Give her a key to your apartment.
Ross: Whoa-hello! We were closer with the mixed tape.
Monica: All right. Have you said, "I love you?" You could say, I love
you.
Phoebe: No, we hate that.
Monica: That is a slap in the face.
Rachel: I think, if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples
through that sweater.
Doug: Oh? Why not?
Chandler: Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak. (Doug looks at him.) But to hell with
that bitch.
Mona: Yeah, I-I think I suggested that.
Mona: Okay.
Mona: Really?!
Ross: Really.
Rachel: You gave her a key to your apartment?!
Ross: Not just a key, I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in a
very serious relationship.
Ross: Oh great, I live on the street.
Phoebe: Where?! (Ross exits.)
Rachel: Hey!
Phoebe: Hi! Okay, Monica, Rachel, this is my friend Roger.
Roger: Hey everybody.
Monica: Hi Roger.
Rachel: Yeah. (They go into the kitchen.)
Rachel: What?
Rachel: Phoebe no!
Rachel: No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do
it with some random guy!
Phoebe: Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!
(Phoebe exits.)
Doug: Oh Bing, look at those twin sisters dancing together. Let me buy you a lap
dance with those girls. Huh?
Chandler: Oh no-no-no!
Ross: No. That guy is.
Locksmith: Good luck buddy. (Exits.)
Mona: What?
Ross: I love you!
Monica: From the tequila factory?
Monica: Come here. I can breath through my mouth.
Monica: I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday
card this year?
Joey: Who was that?
Joey: Then why did I ask?
Joey: Is that college talk for horny?
Joey: Good, I uh, I saw a pretty big pigeon.
Joey: Yeah, I gotta, I gotta go to my room too.
Rachel: Okay, good night!
Joey: Good night. (They both enter their rooms.)
Rachel: Right back at ya!
Joey: But plus, it would be wrong and weird and-and-and bad.
Joey: I know!
Joey: Do you wanna do it?
Rachel: No!
Joey: All right, me neither! I was just testing you!
Joey: This conversation never happened!
Rachel: Never happened! Good night!
Joey: Good night!
Joey: Get back in there! (Rachel re-enters her room and closes the door.)
