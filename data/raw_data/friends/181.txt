Ross: Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.
Joey: Yes.
Joey: Yes. I like Rachel.
Ross: Rachel?!
Ross: But R-R-Rachel-Rachel?! 
Gunther: Rachel?!!
Rachel: Whoa!!
Chandler: Oh! (Pulls his hand away.)
Rachel: Wow that was a big one.
Phoebe: (entering) Oh hey you guys!
Chandler: Oh hey!
Rachel: Hi!
Phoebe: Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?
Phoebe: Uh-huh, (To Chandler) and you?
Phoebe: Okay, good.
Chandler: Why?
Chandler: What?
Phoebe: Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other half.
Rachel: Uh-huh.
Phoebe: He has brown hair.
Rachel: Of course, of course.
Chandler: A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!
Phoebe: He works with food!
Rachel: Oh sure. Older?
Rachel: Oh, I was just gonna ask!
Monica: Hey.
Ross: Hey.
Ross: Why?
Monica: He says he wants to leave the country. (Pause) He thinks you hate him.
Monica: All right. Now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars into Vermont money.
Phoebe: Oh! Hi!
Monica: Hi!
Phoebe: Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don.
Phoebe: (mouths to Chandler) Soul mate.
Chandler: (mouths to Phoebe) What?
Phoebe: (cough talks) Soul mate.
Monica: So, what have you guys been doing?
Don: Well, we just had a terrible lunch today at Reattica. What is with all the sun-dried tomatoes at that place?
Monica: I know! What is this, 1985?!
Monica: Not really.
Monica: So Don, what-what other restaurants do you like?
Monica: No!
Don: Your food is fantastic! Wow, I really want to talk to you about your menu, once I get some coffees first. Um, anyone want any?
Chandler: What are you doing?!
Chandler: I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!
Monica: (returning) Phoebe, good work.
Phoebe: Yeah?
Joey: Hey.
Ross: Hey.
Joey: Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.
Joey: Oh what then? Kick me?
Ross: No.
Joey: (getting worried) Bite me?
Ross: Okay.
Ross: Thank you.
Joey: Yeah, I thought you knew that.
Ross: Umm, no.
Ross: I think you need to tell her how you feel.
Joey: Are you sure?
Joey: Hey thanks.
Ross: Yeah, tell me about it. (He stands up, turns his back to Joey, and enjoys another sip.)
Don: Excuse me?
Chandler: Is it made of cheese?
Chandler: (disgusted) Oh come on! (To Phoebe) Are you listening to this?
Chandler: What do we do?
Joey: Okay. Okay, I can do this. I can tell her how I feel. Just uh, just stand up straight. (Does so.) Take a couple deep breaths. (Does so.) Look confident. (Does so as Rachel opens the door and startles him.)
Joey: I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something.
Joey: Here? In the hall? What are we animals?
Rachel: Sure! That sounds great! Just leave me a message and tell me where to meet you. Okay? (Walks away.)
Chandler: Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.
Monica: Jeez! What is with you?
Chandler: I love you.
Monica: I know.
Joey: I would, but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin doing Hobbs.
Rachel: Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?
Joey: Yeah. Sure. (They both half stand up, Joey pulls the neck of his sweater out, and Rachel looks down it to see his T-shirt.)
Joey: Uh-huh, long time.
Rachel: Yeah.
Joey: Actually uh, could you give us a second?
Rachel: So you were saying?
Rachel: (stunned) What?
Joey: Does it really matter?
Rachel: Wow! Wow. Wow. Wow, it is hot in here.
Joey: But. (Hangs his head down.)
Rachel: Joey.
Rachel: Can I? (Hug him.)
Joey: Sure! 
Rachel: Yeah, that was a real good one.
Waiter: Yeah.
