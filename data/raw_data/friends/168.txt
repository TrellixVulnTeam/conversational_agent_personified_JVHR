Phoebe: Yeah, bye.
Joey: Bye.
Chandler: (entering) Hey, what was that all about?
Monica: Well I guess there is no harm in telling you now, Rachel and Ross are gonna have a baby.
Chandler: (in the high pitched voice) What?! (Normal voice) I am an excellent secret keeper. I have kept all of our secrets.
Joey: What secrets?
Chandler: Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper.
Chandler: You already know.
Phoebe: Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon.
Phoebe: All in good time my love. All in good time. Oh shoot! I left my guitar in their apartment. Well you can let me in later.
Phoebe: What?! They took mine to give to you!
Joey: Why would they take away our keys?
Joey: Hey, I washed those!
Phoebe: Well, what am I gonna do? I really need my guitar!
Joey: Yeah, I have stuff in there too.
Phoebe: What stuff?
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Phoebe: Did Rachel find you?
Ross: No why?
Phoebe: Oh she was looking for you.
Phoebe: Well, she really wanted to talk to you now.
Joey: Yeah, it seemed pretty important.
Ross: Oh no.
Phoebe: What?
Ross: I think I might know what this is about.
Joey: Really?
Phoebe: (deadpan) And?
Ross: Wow! I thought you would be a little more shocked.
Phoebe: Oh sorry. (Shocked) And?!
Ross: Why? What-what else could it be?
Joey: Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel.
Chandler: We are on our honeymoon.
Monica: Grab my ass!
Joey: What the hell is that?
Joey: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?
Phoebe: Oh! We could have done that.
Chandler: No.
Monica: Me neither! We have to get in! (She runs through the door with Chandler in tow.)
Chandler: Just act like you belong.
Monica: Oh my God! Oranges!
Chandler: Shh! (To the guy behind the counter) Nice to see you again. (They tries to walk past him.)
Chandler: Yes, of course. (Shows him the tickets.)
Chandler: Apology accepted. Excuse us. (They try to enter again.)
Monica: Fine. (Starts to walk away then she runs over and grabs an orange before she exits.) Go! Go! Go!
Rachel: (seeing him) Hi!
Ross: Hi.
Rachel: You do?
Ross: Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should talk first.
Rachel: (warily) Okay.
Rachel: (confused) What?
Rachel: Seriously. What?!
Ross: Oh sure. (He sits on the apothecary table and touches her hand.)
Rachel: (closes her magazine) Can I get you some water?
Rachel: Ross, there is no pressure on you. Okay? I mean you can as involved as you want. (Ross nods.)
Ross: What? What? What?!! Well they should put that on the box!!!
Rachel: They do!
Ross: Oh well I may as well have!
Ross: (grabs her) Shh! Shh! Shh!
Rachel: (stops) Okay.
Joey: (eating) Huh. So then I can heat this up? (Goes and does so.)
Phoebe: Oh no.
Ross: Hi.
Ross: Sure.
Ross: Namaste. (Bows.)
Ross: Oh my God! What happened to the door?!
Ross: Look, is Rachel here? I really need to talk to her.
Phoebe: (simultaneously) Holy mother of God!!!
Ross: With my child.
Phoebe: That is brand new information!!
Phoebe: A little bit.
Joey: How are you doing?
Joey: Well, what did you say to her?
Ross: Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful. And then when I turned around she was gone.
Phoebe: Oh Ross.
Ross: But hey, in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97% effective.
Joey: (shocked) What?
Ross: I gotta go find her.
Ross: Evidently they do.
Joey: What?! (Grabs his condoms from his pocket and looks.)
Monica: What? (Monica sees the first couple and gasps.)
Monica: No!! You have been screwing us all day!
Man: Who are you?
Chandler: (looks at Monica then at them) We need the stuff.
Monica: What? Are you serious?! (To Chandler) Joey smells gas!
Chandler: What else is new?
Monica: Well do something! Get in there!
Joey: How? I guess I could break down your door.
Monica: Yeah! Do that!
Nurse: Okay Rachel, are you comfortable?
Rachel: (sighs) If I said I was, would you judge me?
Nurse: The doctor will be here in a minute to do your sonogram.
Ross: Hi!
Rachel: (shocked) Hi!
Ross: Uh we-we need to talk.
Ross: Please, please I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today.
Rachel: Okay. Head Ross! Head Ross! Head Ross!
Rachel: What married?
Ross: Well yeah, I think we should get married.
Rachel: Excuse me?
Rachel: What?!
Rachel: I can too eat by myself!
Ross: When have you ever?
Rachel: When certain people leave the table and I am not finished!
Ross: Well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!
Rachel: Oh please, you inhale your food!
Dr. Long: (entering) Am I interrupting?
Rachel: Oh no Dr. Long, please come in. This is Ross, he is the father.
Ross: But not the husband, because evidently she can do this alone.
Rachel: I do need you! I need you to stand near my head!
Dr. Long: Okay, everything looks good. Here it is on the screen. (We see Ross and Rachel looking at the screen.) Here is your uterus. And right here is your baby.
Ross: Oh my God.
Rachel: Wow. There it is, I see it.
Rachel: Okay.
Ross: Thank you.
Ross: Pretty amazing huh?
Ross: What? What?!
Ross: You-you just said that you did!
Ross: Do you really?
Ross: Come on! Come on! Here, okay-okay, you see this? (Points) This tiny thing that looks like a peanut?
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: Hi.
Joey: Hey!
Phoebe: Hey! So how was the doctor?
Rachel: Oh, everything went great.
Phoebe: Good.
Ross: Oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus.
Phoebe: Oh.
Ross: Oh. (He takes the picture and hugs her.
