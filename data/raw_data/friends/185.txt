Rachel: (entering) Hi!
Monica: Hey!
Phoebe: Hey!
Phoebe: About twenty, a couple people from work who had something else to do. 
Monica: Also both of your sisters called and neither can make it.
Monica: Oh my God, your mother!
Monica: Well, given that we forgot to invite her it would be an awfully big coincidence if she was.
Rachel: My God!
Monica: (interrupting her) Oh give it a rest!
Rachel: So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?!
Phoebe: No. (Pause) Neither is mine.
Monica: Thank you. (Hangs up.)
Monica: Son of a bitch! (Calls Mrs. Green again.)
Chandler: Hey Joe! You wanna shoot some hoops?
Ross: Oh cool!
Ross: Well do you want some help?
Ross: Awesome!
Chandler: Okay, I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time.
Chandler: Bamboozled?
Ross: (simultaneously with Chandler) Yeah!
Chandler: (simultaneously with Ross) No!
Joey: I said a little bit Ross. Now, how about you Chandler?
Chandler: Bogota.
Chandler: What does a Wicked Wango card do?
Chandler: Higher or lower than what?
Joey: This is embarrassing. (Looks it up.)
Chandler: (To Ross) Can you believe how lame this is?
Monica: You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!
Monica: Hi!
Monica: Okay. I can do that. (Pause) I gotta go powder my ass.
Rachel: Okay. (Mrs. Green helps her up and they walk over and get some tea.)
Rachel: What?
Rachel: Wh-wh-what? What?
Rachel: Yes. Yes I do.
Joey: Okay, this is gonna be tough. Hold your breath.
Chandler: Let me see that.
Joey: This one right here. (Ross whines.)
Chandler: Triscadecaphobia.
Ross: (exhaling) The fear of Triscuts! 
Joey: No! No, fear of the number 13.
Chandler: Fear of Triscuts?
Chandler: This game makes no sense!
Joey: All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.
Joey: You-you must choose Mr. Bing.
Chandler: Either, it makes no difference.
Joey: Choose, you jackass!
Ross: What?!
Chandler: This game is kinda fun.
Rachel: Why did you invite my mother?!
Monica: What?
Rachel: She wants to move in with me and Ross to help take care of the baby.
Phoebe: For how long?
Rachel: Eight weeks. I mean I love my mother, but my God, a long lunch with her is taxing.
Monica: I personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me.
Rachel: What? You guys, come on! What am I going to do?
Rachel: Okay. (She goes over to tell her mother.)
Rachel: Oh yeah. Okay, see mom, the truth is I can do this on my own.
Rachel: He was a hamster! I am not going to vacuum up my baby!
Rachel: Wow!
Phoebe: Okay, this is from your friend at work.
Rachel: Oh, it dispenses clean diapers!
Rachel: What?! It goes ten times a day! What are we feeding this baby?! Indian food?!
Monica: Rachel, listen to your mother. She is very smart.
Chandler: Treasure of the Sierra Madre!
Chandler: Madre Sierra the of Treasure!
Joey: Yes!
Joey: Wise choice, how many rungs?
Chandler: Six!
Joey: (makes a sound like a monkey) That noise can only me one thing.
Chandler: (disappointed and simultaneously as Ross) Hungry monkey.
Ross: (thinking) Oh. (Pause) Oh! Oh my God! Okay, I know this, give me-give me a second!
Chandler: Tell it to the Time Turtle!
Ross: Shut up! I Dream of Genie!
Chandler: (annoyed) Oh come on!!
Joey: All right! All right! Uh, umm, Super-Speedy Speed round!
Ross: Is there a hopping bonus?
Joey: Of course!
Joey: Who invented bifocals? 
Ross: Ben Franklin.
Joey: Correct! Which monarch has ruled Great Britain the longest?
Ross: Queen Victoria.
Joey: Correct again! But, you forgot to switch legs between questions, so no hopping bonus!
Ross: Noooo!!! Every time!!!
Joey: Now, over to Chandler.
Joey: Are you sure?
Chandler: Yes! (Pause) No! (Pause) Google!
Chandler: Nooo!!
Ross: Yeah!!
Chandler: This is the best game ever!!!
Rachel: Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?
Rachel: Okay.
Monica: It is going to be okay! (Mrs. Green glances over her shoulder and glares at Monica while she heads for the bathroom.) It was worth a shot.
Ross: (entering, out of breath) Hey!
Phoebe: Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?
Ross: I just Bamboozled Chandler! (Flexes in victory while everyone stares at him.) Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.
Phoebe: Not if you were here.
Ross: Wow! It looks like we got a lot of good stuff.
Rachel: Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.
Ross: (excited) A Play-Dough Barber Shop?
Ross: Uh, what?
Ross: Hi roomie! (Hugs her and looks at Rachel.)
Joey: (announcer voice) Rightie-O Ray!
Erin: Wayne Gretzky.
Joey: Correct! Now, would you like to pick a Wicked Wango card or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?
Rachel: Oh no? Pheebs? Monica? Do I know anything about babies?
Phoebe: No, not a thing.
Ross: Yeah.
Rachel: Really?
Rachel: Thank you. (Hugs him.)
Ross: Oh. (Rachel and he start to stand up.)
Monica: Really?
Phoebe: Uh-huh!
Phoebe: You should be!
Monica: Yeah could-could-could you get me something to drink?
Phoebe: You got it!
Ross: You sure?
Rachel: Uh, put your elbow in it.
Ross: Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap?
Rachel: Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers.
Ross: Excellent! Excellent, now-now do you want another question or a Wicked Wango card?
Rachel: A card! A card! I pick a card!
