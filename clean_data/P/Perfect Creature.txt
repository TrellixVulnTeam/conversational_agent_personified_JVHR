PERFECT CREATURE: Written by Glenn Standring
SHOOTING SCRIPT: 14 May 2004
LILLY: For three hundred years the great plagues have swept the earth. Diseases created from the experiments of the Alchemists. Lilly Thinking they had discovered Gods secret code for life, the Alchemists experimented with genetic science. They had no idea what they had unleashed.
LILLY (CONT'D): (continuing) ...but there was also a miracle. One of these plagues helped nature create a new kind of being. At first they were called Nosferatu, or Vampire and were feared. But they were not supernatural monsters, just a better version of ourselves. They were the Brothers, and their religion and science helped sustain us against the plagues and influenzas that have ravaged Europe and the rest of the colonies. For 300 years our two races have lived in harmony. Until now...
GENETIC DOCTOR: (off) See here. This is what you need to look for.
GENETIC DOCTOR: (continuing; off) A genetic mutation, we all carry it. But we now know a virus activates it.
GENETIC DOCTOR: (continuing)
GENETIC DOCTOR: (continuing) Apprentice   DOCTOR
GENETIC DOCTOR: (to the woman)
GENETIC DOCTOR: (continuing) (to woman)
GENETIC DOCTOR: Apprentice DOCTOR (to woman) Apprentice DOCTOR (continuing; off)
AUGUSTUS: This is your brother Silus. You will teach him.
SILUS AS A BOY: Is that my mother?
AUGUSTUS: No, not any more.
AUGUSTUS: (continuing) Welcome to the world little Brother.
AUGUSTUS: The girl?
SILUS: It is taken care of.
AUGUSTUS: This is good.
SILUS: Augustus. We failed this girl. We asked her to help us catch him, and then we failed her.
AUGUSTUS: Yes. But her death served a greater good. Every trap needs bait.
AUGUSTUS: (continuing) Are you sure you won't join me?
SILUS: Perhaps this is beyond us. Perhaps we should inform the authorities. The human beings.
AUGUSTUS: For now the Brothers feel we should deal with this ourselves.
SILUS: If they find out we are covering up these deaths...
AUGUSTUS: Which is why you must find him. Silus.
AUGUSTUS: (continuing) For centuries we Brothers have served mankind and them us. The great union. But remember your history. 300 years ago when our kind were first born into this world they burnt our children as monsters. They had no notion of evolution. In another world we might all have been slaughtered, only to be remembered in myth, monsters to frighten the young or a puzzle for anthropologists. We must refuse to let one aberrant individual destroy the balance between the two races. The old prejudices are still there. Human beings are paranoid creatures by nature.
SILUS: Perhaps they have good reason.
AUGUSTUS: Silus. Simply concern yourself with finding Edgar. Find your Brother so that we can help him. Before he kills again.
JONES: Everyone's ready Lilly.
LILLY: About time.
LILLY: (continuing) On three gents. One, two...
JONES: (to the woman) Don't you move!
LILLY: (to the slum landlord) Don't you dare.
LILLY: (continuing) Jones!
JONES: God help us. What an appalling sight.
SLUM LANDLORD: I don't know nothing about it. I give 'em out. Make sure everyone gets 'em.
JONES: That's a lie! We know you've been trading influenza vaccine in the workhouses!
FRANK: Lil'. I think you should see this.
FRANK: I'd use the mask if I were you.
WOMAN IN THE BASEMENT: Help me. Please help.
WOMAN IN THE BASEMENT: (continuing) Please. I'm sick. Please.
JONES: You're a fucking liar!
SLUM LANDLORD: No, no, I swear it, I gave 'em their boosters, both of 'em. I'm a responsible landlord, I swear to god. There must've been something wrong with them vaccines.
JONES: This is a civil health violation! You're going to the hell house for this. You can forget lovely Doris here where you're going.
LILLY: There's only one other thing.
PROSTITUTE: Oi! How about me? He promised me some of that. I earned it.
FRANK: (hitting the horn) Come one!
JONES: Lil', you want some?
LILLY: Smells terrible.
JONES: I'm not letting that scum put me off my food. That'd be like a moral victory.
LILLY: I'll get out here.
FRANK: You sure?
FRANK: (continuing) What's up with her?
FRANK: (continuing) Jones? Is she alright?
JONES: Yeah. Lilly's kid. It died of the influenza, didn't it.
FRANK: She's never said anything about a kid.
JONES: No. She never says anything.
KID: Hey?! Hey!
MAN IN THE STREET: Where are you going in such a hurry my little ruffian? Pilfering by the look of you?
MAN IN THE STREET: (continuing) What's going on here? What'd you do to her?
KID: Don't, I didn't do nothing. It was a Brother. It was a Brother did it.
MAN IN THE STREET: Oh dear god...
AUGUSTUS: 300 years ago, with these simple instruments, the alchemist Guiseppi De Angelo discovered what we today call genetic science.
AUGUSTUS: (continuing) He deciphered that the Brothers were a new race of beings, sent by god, to serve and protect you.
AUGUSTUS: (continuing) De Angelo formed the church of the Brotherhood. He was a great great man, but there were others, bad men, who took what De Angelo had discovered and experimented without concern for the results. The science of genetics and all its power has been banned ever since. Who can tell me what came from these bad experiments?
AUGUSTUS: (continuing) Yes.
CHILD: All the bad things. Like bad germs and flu.
AUGUSTUS: Yes. That's right.
AUGUSTUS: (continuing) All the bad things.
JONES: Someone should flatten this cesspool and start again.
STREET REPORTER: Marm? The Tribune. Do you have any comments on the death?
LILLY: No.
STREET REPORTER: They're saying it was a Brother, is that true?
LILLY: Arrest her.
LILLY: (continuing; to Jones) Find any witnesses and shut them up.
LILLY: Can I step in?
FORENSIC GUY: With the traffic. What's it matter.
DOMINIC: (continuing)
LILLY: (continuing)
JONES: (to forensics team)
JONES: (continuing)
JONES: (continuing)
LILLY: (continuing)
LILLY: (continuing)
LILLY: (continuing; to the policeman)
LILLY: (continuing)
KID: (nervous)
LILLY: (continuing)
KID: (surprised)
LILLY: (continuing)
LILLY: (continuing)
LILLY: Where did he go?
KID: He went straight up there.
LILLY: Alright, you go with these men, they'll look after you. I promise.
LILLY: (continuing; to the Policemen) Get him to describe it all. And keep him away from everyone.
LILLY: (continuing; to the Policemen) And get him some food.
JONES: Now they'll all want feeding.
LILLY: (off) I've quarantined the neighborhood.
LILLY: (continuing) As far as anyone knows we have a new influenza outbreak.
ANDERSON: What about the telephonic companies?
LILLY: They're cooperating, closing all phone lines in and out except directly to us.
ANDERSON: Sit, sit.
ANDERSON: (continuing) You've done well Lilly. The reporter is more of a problem. We have 2 days by law before we have to release her. Then it's out.
ANDERSON: (continuing) I hate these things. I'm like a pin cushion.
LILLY: It's better than the alternative, sir.
ANDERSON: I need you to stay with this, Lilly. You know Jamestown better than anyone, how to handle the people.
ANDERSON: (continuing) The Brothers have requested to be involved with the investigation.
LILLY: That's nice for them.
ANDERSON: You have a problem with it?
LILLY: Not particularly.
ANDERSON: Good. I think they can help. And I don't want someone working on this whose got something against the Church.
LILLY: How do you know I don't?
ANDERSON: Lilly, you're the least prejudiced person I know. In fact, you're the only one I know. That's important. The church is powerful, but more than that, people's faith in the Brotherhood is about all they've got these days. And the government knows it. Even the Queen herself is involved. This is political.
JONES: Lil'. He's here.
STEPH: Do you know who he is? That's Brother Silus. They say one day he will lead the Brotherhood. He's a great man.
JONES: I think I hear choir music.
STEPH: Do you respect anything?
JONES: Hey. My old mum goes to church four times a week and gives blood. She's happy as a lark. Just don't expect me to kiss him, that's all I'm telling you.
LILLY: Senior Brother Edgar... How long have you known about this?
SILUS: (continuing)
SILUS: (continuing)
SILUS: (continuing)
LILLY: Really.
SILUS: How many other Captains in this borough are female?
LILLY: None?
SILUS: How are your actions judged, the same or differently from the men.
LILLY: Differently.
SILUS: Exactly. If a white man kills, then he is just a killer. If a black man kills, then all black men are suspect. That is the nature of prejudice. Those who are different are grouped together. If only one Brother does a bad thing then all Brothers are suspect, because we are different. And then what would this world be like, if there was no hope?
LILLY: Alright then. So what do you suggest?
SILUS: First, there is something you should hear.
LILLY: (continuing)
LILLY: (continuing)

EDGAR: (off, like to a lover)
MAN ON THE TAPE: (off)
EDGAR: (off)
EDGAR: (off)
EDGAR: (continuing; off)
EDGAR: (continuing; off)
LILLY: (continuing) I'll lead the other team with Dominic, Jones and Queen's Imperial Guard in support. No guns, batons only.
JONES: What?
LILLY: You heard me. He's to be taken alive.
SILUS: Yes.
LILLY: Anything?
SILUS: No.
LILLY: It's getting late.
SILUS: He will come.
LILLY: Ok. We'll sit tight.
JONES: This is a dud.
LILLY: Frank?
FRANK: Yeah Lil'.
LILLY: (off) Anything?
FRANK: Not a thing.
LILLY: (off) Check each floor again.
FRANK: You heard her. Once more for the empire.
EDGAR: Shoo.
FRANK: Lil'! Lil'!
LILLY: Frank.
FRANK: (off) He's on the sixth floor! He's on the sixth floor!
LILLY: Let's go.
LILLY: (whispering) Police. Get back inside. Get back.
JONES: Lil'.
JONES: (continuing) Fuck!
EDGAR: You're so strong.
JONES: Lilly!
JONES: (continuing) Oh shit shit.
DOMINIC: Lilly's hurt. She's hurt!
DOMINIC: (continuing) He's in the ventilation shaft!
JONES: (continuing)
JONES: (continuing)
SILUS: (continuing)
SILUS: (continuing)
SILUS: (continuing) He's going up.
JONES: (continuing)
LILLY: Antibiotics. They say it's like an animal bite.
LILLY: (continuing) I want to thank you.
SILUS: We all caught Edgar.
LILLY: I don't mean that. The blood, they say it saved my life. Is it true that people who go to church are given your blood?
SILUS: Sometimes the rituals call for it. Some say they have visions from it. That it restores their health.
LILLY: (continuing)
LILLY: Yes. We're good at that.
SILUS: I think yours will be a good life to watch, Lilly. Goodbye.
JONES: Nicely done. You're more human than I thought.
AUGUSTUS: Silus. You know Professor Liepsky.
SILUS: How is he?
PROFESSOR LIEPSKY: See for yourself.
SILUS: Is the brace necessary?
AUGUSTUS: He decapitated a guard as they brought him in. Even though he was sedated. He said he will drink us all dry.
SILUS: Insane then.
PROFESSOR LIEPSKY: Not quite.
PROFESSOR LIEPSKY: (continuing) He's become infected.
SILUS: With what?
AUGUSTUS: Go on, Brother Silus will soon be part of the inner circle of the Brotherhood. He should know this.
PROFESSOR LIEPSKY: If she wasn't restrained she would try to kill you. Don't worry, it's only transmissible through their blood. We designed it that way.
SILUS: Designed?
PROFESSOR LIEPSKY: (continuing)
PROFESSOR LIEPSKY: (continuing) Before that, his brain will wither like these women. Containment will be the issue.
SILUS: (off) The police officer. Lilly. Did he infect her with this?
PROFESSOR LIEPSKY: (off) No. She was lucky. But it is in Edgar's blood. It always will be.
SILUS: Hello my Brother.
EDGAR: (continuing)
EDGAR: (continuing)
EDGAR: (continuing)
EDGAR: You've chosen to watch over her. You want her don't you? I can see it in your eyes. You are like me.
SILUS: I will pray for your cure, Brother.
EDGAR: I wont be able to forgive you for this you know? Not ever. In fact, when I get out of here...
EDGAR: (continuing) I will make you see. I will show you the way. I will see you drink your little police woman right through.
CONSOLE OPERATOR 1: I don't like it when he does that.
CONSOLE OPERATOR 2: (scolding Edgar; into microphone) You stop that or we'll use the gas!
LILLY: Take them away from here.
JONES: You don't feel like a drink?
JONES: (continuing) Now my girls, anyone hungry?
CONSOLE OPERATOR: (off) If you don't stop that we'll use the gas. You hear me?
JONES: (off)
TV PRESENTER: (off)
CONSOLE OPERATOR: I turned off the lights to try and calm him...
CONSOLE OPERATOR: (continuing) We gassed him as usual. We waited 10 minutes. He must have held his breath.
AUGUSTUS: The blood flows, through them, to us and we preserve them, preserve the blood we are bound to protect.
SILUS: Let the blood be one and the two races join, as the Perfect Creature.
EDGAR: Today my brother enters the history books, Professor.
PROFESSOR LIEPSKY: (over the tannoy) Move back!
EDGAR: Tonight all the Brothers will be with him. A perfect day for me to celebrate.
EDGAR: You won't be taking any more calls today.
AUGUSTUS: Now he carries this thing out into the world. Can you imagine what will happen if he infects others? Or if the experiments were known.
SILUS: The question becomes what will he do next? He said he would kill us all. But especially the police officer. Lilly.
PROSTITUTE: Come on governor, you going to pay me or not?
FREDDY: Soon enough my cherub. I've not finished with you yet.
FREDDY: You've been ripping me off! I should blow your dirty little brains out!
STEPH: (off) Police! Put the gun down now!
FREDDY: It's ok. I'm complying officer, see.
STEPH: Put the gun on the ground and step away!
STEPH: (to the prostitute) (to Freddy)
STEPH: (continuing)
FREDDY: (continuing)
EDGAR: (continuing)
PARISHONER: Holy brother, please...
LILLY: Let him go.
LILLY: (continuing) He's harmless. Let him go.
PARISHONER: Forgive me. I've offended you...
SILUS: No. You are divine. It is the world that offends me.
LILLY: Brother Silus. What's going on?
JONES: (off) A shopkeeper heard yelling. Went to see, found this. One witness. A prostitute.
JONES: (continuing) She identified this lovely citizen. We thought maybe he had a grudge or was crazy. I guess we were wrong.
SILUS: It is Edgar.
LILLY: And now he's got Steph. Why does he want her?
SILUS: She is not what he was after.
LILLY: Steph was staying with me. She was wearing my coat. It was me he was after. Wasn't it?
SILUS: Yes. He will come for you Lilly.
JONES: Right, then we put you somewhere safe and set up this place. Shooters on the roofs. And when he comes we blow his fucking brains out.
SILUS: He will know. He will see and hear it.
LILLY: It has to be me. That's what he wants. It's the only chance Steph's got.
JONES: What are you talking about, she's probably dead already...
LILLY: Jones! And we can't make it too hard. He has to be able to get in. He can't suspect anything.
LILLY: (continuing) That's the way it will be. I'm the bait.
STEPH: Help me. Please, I'm sick. Help me.
FREDDY: Don't fucking touch me.
FREDDY: Hey!
FREDDY: (continuing) Where've you gone now?
JONES: What are you doing?
LILLY: What is it? Jones?
SILUS: Stay here.
LILLY: Cover me.
EDGAR: You saved me...
EDGAR: (continuing)
EDGAR: (continuing)
LILLY: (to Jones)
LILLY: (continuing)
EDGAR: (continuing)
EDGAR: (continuing)
JONES: You happy now?
FREDDY: You scared the shit out of me. Hey, the police woman. She's real sick. To tell the truth I don't feel so hot myself.
EDGAR: I want you to take her and put her where they'll find her.
FREDDY: But I'm sick. She's given me something...
EDGAR: What have I said to you?
EDGAR: (continuing) I hate arguments.
JONES: Stephanie Richards, you just brought her in.
NURSE: Thank god you're here.
JONES: Will she recover?
DOCTOR: No. Containment is the issue now. She is... insane. And we've had more cases, 10 in the last hour.
JONES: What is this? What is it?
SILUS: It comes from Edgar. He has shared his blood with them.
JONES: You're telling me that he's out there spreading this around?
JONES: (continuing) He'll give it to Lilly!
DOMINIC: Jones! Back off.
DOMINIC: (continuing) This is spreading.
DOMINIC: (continuing) Brother Silus?
JONES: That's it, Lilly's dead.
SILUS: No. He will keep her alive.
DOMINIC: Why?
SILUS: So that I will come for him. That's what he wants.
DOMINIC: It says, "Everything flows from me. My blood will change the world." What does that mean?
EDGAR: It almost sounds like children playing, don't you think?
LILLY: No.
EDGAR: I looked at your body. You have borne a child.
EDGAR: (continuing) Did you abandon it? Your kind are good at that.
LILLY: Why don't you just kill me?
LILLY: (continuing)
EDGAR: (continuing)
EDGAR: (continuing)
REPORTER: (off) Some say this plague is the result of genetic experimentation, by the Brothers. Do you have a comment?
HEALTH OFFICIAL: (off) We're asking everyone to stay in their homes in the sections of Jamestown now under quarantine.
REPORTER: (off) There are reports of residents being shot trying to escape the quarantine zone. Is that true? They say the Queen has left the city... Is this martial law?
SOLDIER: We've blocked off this section, and here, containing the Jamestown slums.
EDGAR: (off) Do you like the world I am making for us, Silus? I haven't had your little policewoman yet. But I will soon. You'll just have to find me. You know where I am. Everything flows from me. Remember that...
AUGUSTUS: The infection is spreading. Each day he shares his blood with more of them. Even though they are locked in their homes.
AUGUSTUS: Is it the policewoman? Is this affecting your thinking? There is no love for our kind Silus. Only service.
SILUS: We have done this. Released this thing into the world. We have betrayed their trust in us, more than once. I won't do it again.
AUGUSTUS: There is no debate. They will be sacrificed, so the rest will be pure.
AUGUSTUS: (continuing) This policeman, Jones. He talked to the press. Told them this came from Edgar.
AUGUSTUS: (continuing) There are members of the inner circle who question the way you have handled this. Blame you for this man's actions. I have made it clear that you will fix this. That you will silence him.
AUGUSTUS: (continuing) These are hard things we do. But you must think of the greater good. And of your own future.
JONES: Great.
JONES: (continuing) Come on then...
JONES: What do you want?
SILUS: I want to help you. They know you talked to the press.
JONES: They can fuck off. For that matter, so can you.
JONES: (continuing)
JONES: (continuing)
JONES: (continuing)
JONES: (continuing)
JONES: (continuing; sneering)
EDGAR: (off) You know where I am. Everything flows from me...
SILUS: Do you have a map?
JONES: There's the quarantine zone. It's a pit. Slums.
SILUS: The water supply. Where is it?
JONES: There, all the old suburbs are supplied by their own artesian wells. Mineral springs. That's why it hasn't broken out of Jamestown, it's the water. Jamestown's water.
SILUS: He is there, with Lilly.
JONES: You'll never get in, they've circled the whole borough.
SILUS: I will get in. You must go to the press. Tell them about the water. Tell them what the government will do.
JONES: You're dead after this. You know that? Whatever happens.
SILUS: Watch for me, Officer Jones.
PRIEST 2: Who has done this, Brother?
SILUS: We have. To our shame.
PRIEST 2: I have something to show you.
PRIEST 2: It is a miracle my Brother. She is a female, the first of our kind.
SILUS: She must be protected.
SILUS: (continuing) I would ask for your help Brother. The Church can no longer be trusted...
EDGAR: He's coming little one. He's coming for you.
LILLY: No.
LILLY: (continuing) Hello! I'm down here. Silus...
SILUS: Lilly?
EDGAR: It is a maze down here. But given time, that thing will find her. Do things to her. I'll show you where she is, if you take some.
EDGAR: (continuing) You're almost there anyway.
LILLY: Silus...
LILLY: What is it?
SILUS: In there.
LILLY: Is there something wrong?
SILUS: No.
SILUS: (continuing) There is something very precious. You must take it, keep it secret. Don't let them touch it.
LILLY: I don't understand.
SILUS: You will.
SILUS: (continuing) Hurry.
PRIEST 2: The first female of her kind. The first daughter given to us.
PRIEST 2: (continuing) Come. Before they find her.
PRIEST 2: We must go.
LILLY: For me, everything has changed now. Because of Silus I see the world through new eyes.
LILLY: Now I see hope, and I see a child, the first female of her kind.
LILLY: Perhaps Edgar got what he wanted after all, because it time this child will truly change our world.
