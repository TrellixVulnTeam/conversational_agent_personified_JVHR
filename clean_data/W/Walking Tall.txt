CHRIS: Ok. When'd the mill close?
SHERIFF WATKINS: Ahh 3 years this August. If ya lookin for work you might wanna try Aberdeen, that's the closest mill work you're gonna find around here.
SHERIFF WATKINS: Nah just simple economics. Y'know we have a really nice casino here, the wild cherry. You wanna make some money maybe you wanna go on down there and try your luck at the blackjack tables.
SHERIFF WATKINS: Well hell, I know all about you Chris. I know your folks, I'm sheriff Stan Watkins.
CHRIS: How ya doin.
SHERIFF WATKINS: Ralston get outta the car, you're lookin at a real soldier here pay some respect.

SHERIFF WATKINS: Here Chris, (opens the back door) We'll give ya a ride up to your folks.
SHERIFF WATKINS: I insist.
CHRIS: I'll walk.
SHERIFF WATKINS: Hey it's my pleasure.
CHRIS: It's ok.
SHERIFF WATKINS: I won't take no for an answer (jokingly reaches for his gun). HEY! Get in the car.
SHERIFF WATKINS: Did I scare ya with that one?
CHRIS: Lil bit.
SHERIFF WATKINS: Ya. Let's go.
SHERIFF WATKINS: You were gone a while huh?
CHRIS: 8 years. Harstad was sheriff back then.
CHRIS: Thanks for the ride.
SHERIFF WATKINS: No problem, and uh Chris (hands him a piece of paper). It's election month... I'm your man.
MICHELLE: Lil' brother.. You come over here and gimme a hug.
MICHELLE: You look great.
CHRIS: What is this?
MICHELLE: Hey, I couldn't let you be the only one looking good in uniform. Hey ma! Chris is here!
CONNIE: Look at you!
CHRIS: How ya doin! Chris hugs his mother, Connie. A man slowly emerges from the front door.
CHRIS: For good. I'm home.
CONNIE: Really? You're not kiddin.
CHRIS: No. They hug again.
CHRIS: Hey dad.
DAD: Welcome back.
CONNIE: I wish you would have told me you were coming I would've cooked.
MICHELLE: So what are you gonna do now that you're home?
MICHELLE: Pete! This is your Uncle Chris.
CHRIS: Hey Pete.
MICHELLE: Sit down, say hello. Last time he saw you you were barely walking.
MICHELLE: I said you could sleep on the couch. It was Chris' room first.
CONNIE: Pete!
MICHELLE: Pete!
PETE: Y'know, Papa's still got your gun locked up in the garage. Think you could teach me how to shoot?
PETE: Whatever. I'm outta here Mom.
MICHELLE: Okay, be back by ten.
PETE: Ten thirty (as he walks out)
MICHELLE: Ten!
DAD: Remind you of anyone?
CHRIS: No. Why dontcha crash on the floor?
CHRIS: Ok, I'll crash on the floor, you crash on the bed.
CHRIS: Pete. (hands him a towel). Keep ya dry.
CHRIS: Ray Ray! Ahaaa.
RAY: Hello puddin'. They hug.
CHRIS: How ya doin?
RAY: I'm alright.
CHRIS: What is that? (points to the van)
RAY: That's the lovemachine.
CHRIS: Girls actually get in there? Ray shrugs.
CHRIS: How ya been?
RAY: Good. Clean livin.
CHRIS: Wanna beer?
RAY: No. Believe it or not I quit drinkin. I'll take a soda though.
RAY: Thanks man.
CHRIS: Whoah. (spots a tattoo of a guitar on Ray's arm).
RAY: Nahh, look at me now though right? I been clean and sober for 14 months, doing construction and renewing those supportive and healthy friendships from my past. Matter of fact I talked to the bastards, told em you were back and they asked me to politely remind you that kick off's in twenty minutes.
ALL: Let's play ball!
JIMMY: Ray go deep go deep! (as Ray runs off he throws the ball into Ray's back).
CHRIS: Still got a gut huh Jay?
JAY: Still got your reflexes. What, you get tired of being all that you can be?
JAY: Really? I'll just have to see about that. What brings you home?
JAY: Not today. A football game ensues, there are two teams. Jay's guys vs Chris' guys. On the sidelines Pete pulls up on a small motorcycle. Chris notices Pete hanging around with kids smoking. It comes down to the last play, the teams are huddled into two groups talking.
CHRIS: Alright boys, last play. We need to put this to rest.
CHRIS: You got it. On the first hut!
JAY: Ok Vaughn, last chance. Chris gets the ball and throws it. An opponent comes in hard and tackles him low. He collapses. Ray runs for the ball but gets clotheslined by Jay.
OPPONENT: (to Chris) Sorry about that.
CHRIS: That's cool man. Chris Helps Ray onto his feet.
JAY: Welcome home.
CHRIS: Good to be back.
JAY: See ya round. Hey, if you're not doing anythin later on you could come by the casino. I'll introduce ya to some nice girls, drinks are on me. Whaddya say?
JAY: Cool. Jay speeds off in his car. Pete rolls up on his bike.
PETE: Hey Sarge, good game. Maybe next time.
CHRIS: Don't you have to be native american to own a casino?
CHRIS: Nobody's gonna have any problems finding this place.
CHRIS: Not bad.
RAY: Isn't it wonderful? All your gambling needs under one great big roof. You got your ATM machine, tellers to cash your paycheck, and when you're here you don't gotta worry about those lil things like child support, rent, the laws of mathematical probability.
JAY: Heyyy, the dream team!
CHRIS: Nice place.
JAY: Yeah well. Welcome to my world. Look tonight, all the drinks are on the house. If you need a line of credit, say how much. And if you need a lil female companionship... done. Alright? Have a good time.
JAY: Don't you worry about me, I've got a few things to do. Enjoy.
STRIPPER: So you've seen all the old faces.
CHRIS: Could say that.
STRIPPER: Your voice sounds very familiar. The lights come on.
STRIPPER: Chris...
CHRIS: Deni.. The screen goes down again, Chris leaves the booth.
FRIEND 1: Look who's back.
FRIEND 2: So, good surprise?
FRIEND 1: Told you it was better than gambling. You met Candy? (A girl is dancing on their table)
CROUPIER: 6! Easy 6 for a win!
JIMMY: (To some girls) We can do a 6.
JIMMY: (To Chris) We're gettin killed out here. I need you to put 200 down for the bet.
FRIEND 3: Look at them (Nods to girls).
CHRIS: Ok.
CROUPIER: Five hundred on 6?
JIMMY: Yes, I'm in. Boom! Gimme some dice.
CROUPIER: Lookin' for a 6.
CHRIS: Jimmy. Don't roll. Gimme the dice.
CHRIS: (To the croupier) You're good, but I saw it.
CHRIS: I saw the switch.
CROUPIER: Hey this is a clean game asshole.
CHRIS: Yea?
CROUPIER: Yea.
CHRIS: Let's see about that. Chris puts a load of money on the table.
CHRIS: Bet you I'll roll a seven.
CROUPIER: It's not your roll sir. SIR! It's not your roll. Call security.
CHRIS: Put your bets down on the pass line. These dice are comin up seven.
COMMISSIONER: No folks, no payout.
CHRIS: (To croupier) Why don't you just take care of that bet and we're even.
CHRIS: Yea, the problem is your dice are loaded. Does your boss know about this? Just gimme my money.
BAD GUY 2: What are you doin?
BAD GUY 1: (Has a scalpel in his hand) Special forces... special treatment.
BAD GUY 2: This guy knows Hamilton! A struggle ensues and Chris' chest is cut up.
DOCHRIS: (To Chris' family) Folks, he's pretty banged up, inside and out. Whoever did this left him for dead. A lesser man wouldn't have survived.
SHERIFF WATKINS: I'm just tryin to get some facts here.
DAD: Just find out who did this to him Stan.
SHERIFF WATKINS: Thank you.
DOCHRIS: He's gonna be fine Michelle.
MICHELLE: Thanks.
RAY: Thank you, they're for my best friend.
RAY: Hey sarge, so much for our VIP... status. Don't they teach you any fighting skills in the army.
RAY: Not good. But I tell you, that guy was feelin me this morning.
RAY: You okay?
CHRIS: Some homecoming hey.
RAY: I don't know if you've noticed but this aint exactly home any more.
CHRIS: Appreciate that Dad.
DAD: I might've had serious issues with your career choice but just didn't seem fair to take it out on an innocent truck. Where you headin?
DAD: Ya whole life, all you wanted to do was get outta here. What made you come back.
JAY: Hey. First of all I wanna say thanks.
JAY: He's been fired, and his gaming permit's been pulled. I don't know how my security cameras didn't catch that.
JAY: Wait wait... so they got a little rough, they were a bit edgy. Understandably. You don't know what kind of assholes they have to put up with on a daily basis. Look, they've been reprimanded. They say you went nuts man. I'm sorry. I know the proper term vets use is post traumatic stress.
JAY: Ah well. I guess you probably need time to think about it. This is for you. It's a little something to help you get... Y'know..
JAY: I'm sorry you feel that way. I'll see ya round Chris.
CHRIS: Excuse me. An officer is on the phone ignoring him.
CHRIS: Excuse me. The sheriff comes out.
SHERIFF WATKINS: Well hey Chris. Good to see you up and about, you're lookin spiffy.
SHERIFF WATKINS: Well this isn't about that incident at the casino a while back is it?
SHERIFF WATKINS: Cause that matter's closed.
CHRIS: Did you look into it?
SHERIFF WATKINS: They did an internal investigation. That's good enough for me.
SHERIFF WATKINS: Chris, I know you're familiar with the term 'no fly zone'. Hmm? Cause that's what the casino is. Since the mill closed down that casino is the main source of revenue in this town. So, case closed basically. I'll see ya.
SHERIFF WATKINS: Excuse me? What did you say to me?
DENI: Hey.
CHRIS: Hey.
DENI: This belongs to you. She hands him a leather jacket.
CHRIS: I appreciate that, I thought this was history.
DENI: Hi Mrs Vaughn.
CHRIS: Can I talk to you outside for a second. Mom I'll be right back.
DENI: How you been?
CHRIS: Been better.
DENI: Talked to the sheriff yet?
CHRIS: Well I went down to the police station and I talked to somebody with a badge. Sure as hell didn't seem like much of a sheriff.
DENI: Sunshine and pine trees. Been readin these books, teach you how to cultivate happiness. Books on the future, go with the flow, that sorta thing.
DENI: I have my moments.
CHRIS: So the casino huh?
DENI: Yep. Been there almost a year.
CHRIS: Treatin you good?
DENI: Lot better than it treated you.
CHRIS: I like that. Jay Hamilton's done well for himself hasn't he.
DENI: Lasted about 8 minutes, a long long time ago.
DENI: Rent's gotta be paid Chris.
CHRIS: Suppose so.
DENI: Hope to see you around.
CHRIS: Do you? She begins to drive off.
CHRIS: Thanks for the jacket. She toots the horn as she goes.
CONNIE: And where is he?
KID: It's true. We mighta kinda pushed him into it.
CHRIS: Where'd you get the drugs?
KID: I'm not really sure...
CHRIS: Stop. Where?
KID: From the security guys workin at the casino.
CONNIE: Chris, wait. Call the police.
CHRIS: No, that won't do any good. Chris speeds off. He pulls up at their home and enters the garage.
CHRIS: He'll be fine. Chris is searching about and forces open a cupboard.
DAD: What are you doin? Chris pulls out a shotgun and loads it.
DAD: Aw Chris not like this. Chris listen to me. If you go outta here with that gun, they're gonna.. ne... Chris!
LAWYER: I advise you to give this offer more than a little serious thought. If you go to trial you stand to do 18 years. This is a sweet plea, normally they wouldn't even put it on the table but your military record can't be ignored. Three months home arrest, some community service. Pretty generous offer Chris.
LAWYER: Look at it from the other side. There's over a dozen witnesses, none of em are gonna paint a very flattering picture.
WORKER: He started bustin up the machines...
WORKER: Went crazy...
GIRL: Complete psychopath.
CHRIS: They're only offering me this deal just to keep me quiet.
CASINO GUARD: Our job is to keep order. But there was no chance of that. Me and my men we were just tryin to control him. He was highly trained, violent, very dangerous person.
WORKER: Yea that's correct, my right forearm. Both bones with a single shot. It was crazy.
JUDGE: Mr Crow, you may present your client's case.
CHRIS: Your honor, I'd like to plead my own case.
JUDGE: Very well Mr Vaughn.
CHRIS: I don't deny anything that was said here today.
JUDGE: Sustained. Mr Vaughn you're close to being held in contempt.
JUDGE: Will the defendant please rise.
FORMAN: We find the defendant Chris Vaughn not guilty.
CHRIS: Watkins.
WATKINS: Well you won the election, congratulations. We do have a tradition of professional courtesy up here, and I can personally vouch for each and every one of these men. They're good deputies.
CHRIS: License and registration please.
JAY: You're joking right?
CHRIS: License and registration. Jay hands it over.
JAY: What's the problem sheriff?
CHRIS: You. And the drugs you're pedalling out of your casino.
JAY: Yea, and if you push too hard you're gonna be a man who doesn't live to see 40. License please.
JAY: Thanks sheriff.
CHRIS: Sir get your tail lights fixed, it's your last warning.
RAY: Mornin sheriff.
CHRIS: Mornin deputy. Chris tosses Ray a badge.
RAY: No, nope, no. Come on man you know I hate cops. You been sheriff 2 minutes and I'm already startin to hate you. I'm a convicted felon.
RAY: Oh now you're a CROOKED cop doing favours for friends. That's how it starts. See next thing you know you'll be taking bribes, setting up roadblocks, frisking dudes crotches.
CHRIS: I need you to take me to drugs school.
CHRIS: You're SURE you're not carrying anything.
CHRIS: Officer.
RAY: Yeah.
CHRIS: Search him.
RAY: Oh. Spread your legs, arms down. Been workin out? Nothin there. Ohhhh somebody needs a BATH!
B.: Screw you, I do have a bit of information for you. It's not just me actually, there's a whole lotta people in on this one.
BOOTH: You're gonna get hurt.
DAD: Why does it always have to be your fight?
DAD: No. I put my guns down a long time ago.
DAD: You and me both boy. Chris, listen. You be careful.
CHRIS: Can I talk to you?
RAY: Yeah.
CHRIS: Over here?
RAY: Sure.
CHRIS: I'm gonna stay with him tonight. I need you to take care of my parent's place.
RAY: I'm with you man, I'll check in later.
DENI: Don't shoot.
CHRIS: Hey
DENI: Hi. How's the food around here? Brought you special treats. Salmon, Fried Chicken, Potato Salad. You got cups?
DENI: Hmm I quit. I figured you know, you were making some changes around here, I could make a few myself.
RAY: Who's that?
PETE: It's Pete. Want something to eat?
RAY: No I'm good man.
CHRIS: I gotta get a bigger bed.
DENI: No, no you don't.
JAY: Do it.
DENI: I'm hungry.
CHRIS: Got leftovers...
DENI: Mm mmm, I want pancakes, and eggs, and bacon.
RAY: Pete, somethin's burnin.
RAY: Pete? Ray steps into the kitchen but gunmen have infiltrated the home. A fight breaks out and Pete flees. Ray jumps onto the back of a gunman.
CHRIS: (To Deni) Come here. They get down into the hole in the floor.
CHRIS: When I say 'now' start shooting, over there. Stay low.
BOOTH: Vaughn you gotta get me outta here!
GUNMAN: Oh yeah? The gunman takes off his mask and hits him with a pistol.
GUNMAN: (Calling downstairs) Burke?
GUNMAN 2: Check it out. He goes downstairs to find Burke dead on the kitchen floor. He follows traces of blood across the floor.
BOOTH: C'mon! Get me outta here man!
CHRIS: What's it worth to you? Where's the lab?
BOOTH: Ok! Ok! Hamilton's operation is at the mill ok! It's at the mill now get me outta here.
CHRIS: Stay down! Booth is standing and gets shot dead.
MICHELLE: Ray!
GUNMAN 2: Stay down!
RAY: (To gunman's body on the floor) Hey.. you okay?
WATKINS: Tried to warn ya Chris. Didn't want this to happen.
CHRIS: Deni! Now! Deni fires off some shots. Watkins is distracted by the shots, Chris appears in the floor hole and blasts Watkins at close range with a shotgun.
CHRIS: Get up Jay.
JAY: Just a sec. Remember we used to play hide n seek up here?
CHRIS: Get up! Jay stands up and holds up his hands.
JAY: Look... Chris... just... Jay hits a switch on the floor which opens a hatch. Chris falls into the hatch but hangs onto the saw which is swinging over it.
JAY: You wanna know what my new favourite sound's gonna be? The sound of you screaming like a little bitch.
RAY: Runnin the shower tower with the felons. He's probably blowin on somebody's dice right now.
RAY: That's lunch.
CHRIS: Let's go pick my old man and grab somethin to eat.
