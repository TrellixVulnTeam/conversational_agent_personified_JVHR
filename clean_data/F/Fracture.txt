CREDITS SEQUENCE: EXTREME CLOSE-UPS: An unfinished mechanical device: a scaffold of thin metal pipes, levers, pulleys, wiring, serve-motors. THOMAS CRAWFORD works on it: in his 40s, well-dressed but in disarray, graying stubble, hair and clothes unkempt. Magnifying glasses distort his eyes, making them huge and strange. He sets aside a tool, takes a marble-sized ball-bearing and drops it into a slot at the top of the device. His enlarged eyes follow the metal ball - - as it rolls and flips and spirals through a Rube-Goldberg- style maze, setting off bells, clicking past turnstiles - - then missing a leap and clattering across the work-table. Eyes on the device, Crawford's hand traps the ball. He stays still, analyzing. He selects a tiny screwdriver from a neat array of metal- working and electronics tools. Makes a miniscule adjustment to a single joint. Drops in another ball. It rolls and flips and spirals all the way down. Crawford doesn't react.   Just studies the machine. Behind him, on a desk: a framed photograph of a beautiful woman in her mid-30s. His wife.
INT. LUXURY BEACH-HOTEL ROOM - THE SAME TIME: JENNIFER CRAWFORD is just reaching orgasm - - with ROB NUNALLY: mid-30s, good-looking, aging-boyish. They clutch each other, shuddering, lost in passion. And then, breathing heavily, caressing each other - Nunally rolls off her - slowly coming back to earth. Jennifer studies her lover, a quiet play of relief and gratitude and satisfaction on her face - - darkened by a troubled distance, maybe even fear. She is, after all, having an affair.
INT. CRAWFORD'S OFFICE - DAY: Crawford stares through the grotesque lenses, motionless, expressionless. He takes a deep breath and checks his watch.   Then he stands, removing the glasses. We now see his office: large, austere. Decor and equipment related to aircraft engineering. Outside big windows, jets take off from an industrial airstrip. Crawford gets a brand-new bottle of Jack Daniels from a desk drawer, uncaps it and swigs as he opens the door to a private bathroom. He gargles, spits into the sink. He pours out more, then puts the half-empty bottle back on his desk. He collects a home-made device from the workbench: it looks like a PDA connected by wires to a blank credit card. He puts it in the pocket of his suit jacket, which he sets on the desk. Adjusts the placement of the open bottle, nearby. Crawford goes to a light-box, studying a set of large X-rays: dark strips of welding in a grayish fuzz of metal. TINA, his assistant, appears in the doorway.
INT. AIRPLANE HANGER - SOON AFTER: The twisted, torn and burned wreckage of a large private jet is being reassembled on the big empty concrete floor.
INT. LUXURY BEACH-HOTEL ROOM - SOON AFTER: Rob is still in the bed, naked under the sheet - watching Jennifer adjust the straps of her bathing suit.
EXT. SANTA MONICA STREET - DAY: A black Porsche speeds down a quiet street near the beach, pulls into a parking space. Crawford gets out, goes to a pay phone. He puts his cell phone on top of it, drops in some change and dials.
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY: Crawford enters. He knows where he's going - past the front desk and outside to the -
EXT. HOTEL POOL - DAY: Jennifer swims laps with strong, even strokes.   Rob is enjoying the sun in a lounge chair. Crawford eyes them as he passes on the other side of a low fence. Unnoticed, he heads upstairs.
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY: Crawford stops at a room with a DO NOT DISTURB sign on the knob. He takes out his PDA-device and slides its card into the key-card slot of the lock. The lock clicks to green.
INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY: Crawford enters, quietly closing the door behind him. He just stands there, taking it all in. The unmade bed, the ripped-open condom packet, the clothes on the floor. He is silent.   Very still.
EXT. CRAWFORD'S STREET - LATER: Jennifer drives her Mercedes convertible past expensive houses in the late-afternoon light. She goes up the driveway of the Crawfords' stark mordern home. Across the street, MR. GIFFORD is playing catch with his GRANDSON. He waves to Jennifer. She waves back, friendly but distracted, on her way to the front door.
INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS: Cold. Elegant. Metal planters with bamboo trees. Glass doors out to a back garden. A fire in the fireplace. In a corner is another of Crawford's Rube Goldbergs - this one the size of a refrigerator. On a coffee table in the center of the room, a big wooden bowl of ball-bearings. Jennifer hurries in, dropping her keys on a table and - - freezes, startled. Crawford waits in the center of the room; despite the outer "disarray", he is calm and focused.
EXT. GIFFORD HOUSE - FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS: Gifford and his Grandson turn to look at the Crawford house.
INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS: Crawford stands, tilting his head to watch the slow hypnotic curl of smoke leaking from the gun in his extended hand. The hand, we might notice now, wears a surgical glove. He lowers the gun, bends to pick up the ejected shell-casing from the floor. He wipes it and tosses it aside, on his way to Jennifer. He stands looking down at her: face-up on the floor, head in a small pool of blood, eyes and mouth open. The doorbell rings.
EXT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - CONTINUOUS: Gifford leans on the frosted-glass panel next to the door - hands cupped around his eyes, trying to see in.
INT. CRAWFORD FOYER - CONTINUOUS: Crawford steps in from the living room.
EXT. CRAWFORD'S STREET - DUSK: Helicopters overhead, SWAT teams setting up. Nearby houses have been emptied, gawking NEIGHBORS and media vans moved back to a block away. UNIFORM COPS pull aside the barriers as a plain-wrap sedan rolls through. It pulls up by the SWAT Command Truck. ROB NUNALLY gets out, surveying the scene. The guy who spent his afternoon with Jennifer Crawford in the hotel is an L.A.P.D. Detective.
INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - SOON AFTER: Crawford waits, with the gun.    The phone rings.   He picks up:
EXT. CRAWFORD'S STREET - CONTINUOUS: Nunally is standing by the open trunk of his sedan, wearing a Kevlar vest now - putting on his shoulder-holster over it. Into his cell-phone:
INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - CONTINUOUS: Crawford watches Nunally's silhouette appear on the frosted glass, from across the living room.
EXT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - SOON AFTER: Jennifer's stretcher is loaded into an ambulance, doors slamming shut and sirens kicking on - - as Crawford, cuffed behind his back, is pushed into the back seat of a police car. His eyes on the ambulance as it pulls away, carrying his wife.
INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - SOON AFTER: A DETECTIVE uses a pencil to lift Crawford's gun from the coffee table and carefully put it in an evidence bag. Nunally stands back, watching the COPS and TECHNICIANS work the scene - lost in his thoughts, shaken.
INT. WILLY'S APARTMENT - THE NEXT MORNING: The alarm clock shifts to 6:00 am and pops on to local news and traffic - - but the narrow futon bed is already empty. WILLY SLOCUM works at a laptop on his second-hand desk, lit by a solitary lamp. He is in his late-20s, good-looking. Short hair, office-pale but athletic, wearing mis-matched sweats from Eastern Oklahoma State College. He jots a final note, sets his yellow legal pad aside. As he goes to the closet-sized bathroom, pulling off his sweatshirt and starting the tiny pre-fab shower, we linger on the laptop screen: rental listings for a new apartment.
TIME CUT: The bare overhead bulb is on, revealing the concrete floor and painted-plywood walls. His clothes hang neatly on a length of pipe suspended by ropes from the exposed rafters. Law school texts fill cinderblock-and-board shelves. The radio chatters.    Willy knots a tie in his crisp white collar.
TIME CUT: Willy methodically packs legal folders from last night's "homework" into his big, battered briefcase. He has to work to stuff all the files in. He pulls on his suit jacket, settles the shoulders, tugs at his cuffs. Uncaps a pen, leans over a one-sentence letter waiting on the desk. Reads it over. As he signs, we glimpse: - hereby give notice that I will be resigning my position at the District Attorney's Office as of Novemb-
EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS: Willy straightens and takes a breath, re-settling his suit jacket with an irritable glance at his landlady's car, parked sloppily next to the garage, blocking his door. As he walks away, down the alley, we rise up to reveal the hazy sprawling landscape of L.A. - and the towers of Downtown, rising ahead of Willy like Oz.
INT. WILLY'S OFFICE - LATER THAT MORNING: An ancient fluorescent-lit cubby crammed with documents, case files, notes, reference books. Willy on the phone:
INT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY: Norman follows Willy out to a central bullpen area where the shared ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANTS work: MONA and GLADYS.
MONA                            NORMAN: No problem.                     I'm serious.
INT. LOBRUTO'S OFFICE - SOON AFTER: District Attorney JOE LOBRUTO, 50-ish, sits behind a massive oak desk, studying a thick file. Doesn't look up as a SECRETARY shows Willy in. Willy hesitates. Looks around: he's never been here. Flags, wood panelling, leather furniture, windows overlooking the city. Finally Lobruto looks up, takes Willy in.
INT. WILLY'S OFFICE - LATER: Willy's twisting in his rented tux, trying to adjust a buckle on the side of the vest. The phone rings and he gives up, frustrated - pushing the plastic garment-bag aside to answer - - knocking a full cup of take-out coffee on to his chair. Which is where he left his suit. Willy freezes. Watching the coffee seep into the fabric. Into the phone, distracted:
INT. NORMAN'S OFFICE - THE SAME TIME: Norman's looking at a case file.
INT. NORMAN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS: Norman slowly smiles, listening.
INT. COURTROOM - LATER: Willy slips self-consciously through the double-doors, wearing the tuxedo. He gets even more self-conscious when he notices a handful of local REPORTERS. He hurries in - - passing Nunally, in the back row. Nunally is making a good show of keeping it together...but it's only a show. JUDGE IRENE FELDMAN, 50-ish, looks over her half-glasses.
P.D.                              CRAWFORD: (sotto)                    I do.     But, your honor - You do.
INT. PARKING STRUCTURE - LATER: Willy, in his tux, comes out of a staircase and stops.   Rob Nunally is waiting by Willy's parked car.
INT. CHANDLER PAVILION - LOBBY - LATER: Willy moves uneasily among clusters of laughing, chatting, sparkling FORMAL-DRESSED PEOPLE. NIKKI GARDNER joins him, strolling alongside. She's his age, but her elegant dress, unlike his tux, was made for her.
EXT. ARTS CENTER - SOON AFTER: They stroll the emptying plaza, dressed to the nines.
INT. FORENSICS LAB - LATER: MARCHAND, Senior S.I.D. (Scene Investigation Division) Tech, works as he talks into a speaker-phone. He and Willy have teamed-up often, and an underlying respect lets them mock each other.
INT. WILLY'S OFFICE - A WEEK LATER: Controlled chaos. A week's work has emptied the shelves and cleared the surfaces, but the file-cabinet drawers are all half-open: Willy sorts folders, neatly marking and packing them. White "trans-file" storage boxes are piled all over.
INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - THE SAME TIME: S.I.D. TECHS are taking the place apart: opening HVAC vents, pulling books off shelves, upending chairs and tables, removing drawers from cabinets. Marchand, supervising, answers his cell-phone:
INT. COUNTY JAIL - INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER: Metal chairs. Bad light. Crawford sits, cuffed, at a table, waiting. Looks up as the door unlocks. A GUARD lets Willy in, locks the door behind him. Crawford watches Willy take a legal pad, files, pens from his briefcase, set them on the table.
INT. WOOTON, SIMS - EMPTY OFFICE - LATER: It's big. It's got a window. It's got a sofa. Undecorated, except for a pile of materials & boxes marked ARMSTEAD
PHARMACEUTICAL.: Willy is filling out forms - tax, citizenship, benefits.   He doesn't notice Nikki when she comes to the door.
INT. COURTROOM - THE NEXT DAY: JUDGE ROBINSON presiding. A mid-sized crowd, including a few REPORTERS. A UNIFORM COP is in the witness box, Willy stands in the Prosecution Table.
CLOSE-UP: THE DEFENSE TABLE - LATER THAT AFTERNOON: It's a mess of loose legal-pad pages torn from Crawford's pad, each covered in madly intricate schematics. He works on yet another, head down, intent. Dr. MARION KANG is on the stand, using a marker on a big diagram of a head:
INT. COURTROOM - LATER: Nunally on the stand.    Focused, professional.   Crawford draws, ignoring him.
INT. JUDGE ROBINSON'S CHAMBERS - SOON AFTER: The Judge grim, Willy panicked, Crawford calm.
INT. WILLY'S OFFICE - THAT EVENING: The end of a bad, bad day.   Willy flips on the lights as he comes in, shaken. A package is on the empty desk. Addressed in red marker. The return address: TC, County Jail. Willy just stands looking at it.
INT. COUNTY JAIL - THE SAME TIME: Crawford sits on the metal bunk in his prison jumpsuit. Alone. Looking down.
INT. WILLY'S OFFICE - RESUME: As Willy takes a letter-opener from the desk drawer - the phone rings. He answers it, eyes still on the package:
INT. GLAMOROUS BAR - THE SAME TIME: Crowded with UPSCALE YOUNG PROFESSIONALS.    Nikki is on her cell-phone, hand over her other ear:
INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTINUOUS: Crawford very slowly raises his eyes, until he is looking directly at us.
INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTINUOUS: Crawford begins to smile.
INT. WILLY'S OFFICE/GLAMOROUS BAR - RESUME: Willy is staring down at the broken eggshell, barely listening to Nikki.
INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTINUOUS: Crawford stares right at us.       Smiling.   Ice cold.
INT. WILLY'S OFFICE/GLAMOROUS BAR - RESUME: Nikki is sympathetic, misunderstanding Willy's quiet:
INT. MOTEL ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT: Local news on the TV: Willy pushing past media outside the courthouse; official photo of Nunally; footage from the standoff at Crawford's. The sound is low, and Nunally isn't watching. He's sitting on the edge of the bed...looking down at his gun, in his hands. A knock on the door "wakes" him. Beat. He sets the gun aside, goes to peek out the curtains. Lets Willy in.
INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - THE NEXT DAY: A massive search is under way. Marchand's S.I.D. Team has been doubled, back-up by a dozen
SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES -: - passing hand-held metal detectors along the furniture - - taking pictures down from the walls - - turning over mattresses - patting-down every item hanging in the closets - - wriggling into crawlspaces - poking into light fixtures recessed into the ceilings - - opening the air-conditioning unit, up on the roof - - ripping out Crawford's high-end home-theater system - - taking apart the Porsche in the garage. Willy paces the edges of the action, restless, edgy.
INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER: Willy stops in the doorway - watching a DEPUTY shut the stainless-steel freezer, open a wired-glass cabinet and poke around.
EXT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - LATER: Hours have passed.
INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DUSK: It's getting dark out. Techs pack equipment cases, carry them out. The place is a disaster area. Marchand watches Willy pace the living room.
INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LATER: It's night. The house is empty. Except for Willy, turning on lights as he gets to each room, turning them off as he leaves.
INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - BATHROOM - SOON AFTER: Checking the contents of the medicine cabinet.
INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - DRESSING ROOM - SOON AFTER: Willy wanders through Jennifer's spacious dressing room.
INT. HOSPITAL - I.C.U. - NIGHT: The room is dim, and silent except for the hiss-click of the respirator, the monotonous beep of the heart monitor.
INT. CRAWFORD OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY: Willy wanders.   Tina, the assistant, waits in the doorway. He's trying to conceal the fact that he's on a fishing expedition.
INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY: The room where Jennifer and Nunally met. Cleaned-up now, anonymous, empty. Willy stands looking at it. There's nothing to see. He grimaces, nods - heads out, past the ASSISTANT MANAGER waiting in the doorway.
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS: As Willy comes out of the room - he slows, noticing the little gray plastic surveillance-camera-ball in the ceiling.
INT. GARDNER HOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER: A faux-Tudor Hancock Park dining room.   Wealthy, but lived in. JUDGE LEWIS GARDNER, your basic Henry Fonda/Jimmy Stewart- type patriarch, carves a turkey at the head of a long table, wearing a worn and gravy-splattered apron. Platters circulate in both directions among Nikki's older siblings (BURTON and SANDRA), their spouses, their children. Willy sits next to Nikki, who is high-stylish despite the fact that she's dressed "casual."
INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT: Empty.   Dark.   Willy lets himself in. He looks for the light-switch - finds only a complex computerized dimmer-panel. He tries it. Accent lights come on, buried in the living room planters. He can't get any other pre-sets to work. The crime scene is creepy, lit like that. The dried blood is black. Shadows stretch up the walls, strange. Willy grimaces, moves through it - sees another panel by the French doors to the garden. Goes over - - and jumps back, startled -
INT. MARCHAND'S OFFICE - S.I.D. - SUNDAY AFTERNOON: A mess of courtroom exhibits, copies of evidence, lists, depositions, photos, diagrams, take-out food containers and coffee cups.
INT. WILLY'S APARTMENT - VERY LATE THAT NIGHT: Willy stands over crime scene photos and diagrams spread out on his narrow futon. "Walking the scene" again, on paper. The whole apartment is an array of law books, notes, exhibits, marked-up depositions. He's staring at evidence he's already stared at a hundred times. He grinds the palms of his hands into his eye sockets, a dull moan rising into a yell - - as he sweeps everything off his bed in a storm of paper - throwing books - tearing up printouts - pulling out drawers, emptying them, smashing them on the desk - - yelling in a frenzy until his throat is hoarse, his shabby garage apartment is trashed, and he's sitting, exhausted, in his chair. There's a knock on the door. Willy frowns, checking the clock: it's two-thirty a.m.   He goes to open it - - revealing Nunally, standing in the darkness, a haunted shadow of the boyish confident cop we met making love to Jennifer Crawford.
INT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - BULLPEN - THE NEXT MORNING: Willy - in a clean suit and crisp suit, carrying his briefcase - hurries through, paying no attention to the SECRETARIES and OTHER D.D.A.s who watch like he's on his way to his own execution. At his office door, he gestures for Mona to come in with him. Surprised, she gets up - taking with her an envelope with a messenger-receipt taped to the front.
INT. WILLY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS: Mona watches Willy shut the door behind her.
INT. COURTHOUSE - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS: Willy steps off the elevator, into a crowd of REPORTERS AND SPECTATORS outside the courtroom. He's startled for a moment: it's worse than he expected - the dense buzz of talk in the marble corridor and all the eyes tracking him like he's walking into an arena - a freakshow performer - - but he doesn't slow, ignoring the comments and questions, avoiding eye contact - - until he sees Nunally by the courtroom doors, his eyes fixed on Willy. Willy meets Nunally's gaze...moving on, giving back nothing. Nunally watches Willy disappear into the courtroom, stares at the closing doors - uncertain, on edge. Lost, no matter which way this goes.
INT. COURTROOM - SOON AFTER: Mr. Gifford, the Crawford's neighbor, is on the stand.   Willy questions him, standing by the Prosecution Table. Behind him, the court is standing-room-only. REPORTERS, SKETCH ARTISTS, SPECTATORS. Nunally, sitting near the front. Lobruto, standing at the back. Crawford writes intently on a legal pad, filling pages with dense scribble.
INT. COURTHOUSE - CORRIDOR - THE SAME TIME: Mona sits on a bench, a few steps down the corridor from the courtroom doors. Cell phone in her hand.
INT. COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS: Willy stands at the Prosecution Table.       Hearing his own pulse. Crawford studies Willy, curious.
INT. WOOTON SIMS - NIKKI'S OFFICE - THE SAME TIME: Nikki sits at her beautiful desk with stellar views out the windows behind her.
INT. COURTHOUSE - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS: - into the echoing chaos of the corridor - trying to move in the crowd - - shoving through to where people are yelling and clustered around a figure lying on the floor. Willy pushes closer, until he catches glimpses of: Nunally.   Lying on the marble floor. His gun in his lifeless fingers.   Blood all over, from his head. Willy stops pushing. Won't let himself look away - the screams and commotion around him retreating into a numb blur.
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATE THAT NIGHT: The life support system clicks and hisses and beeps. Jennifer is curled into a fetal position, despite the tubes and wires. Willy sits by her bed. Still in his suit from court, the jacket off, the tie loose. He's been there a while.   But now he speaks.
INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - LATER: Sliding glass doors suck open, Willy walks with the Resident from the other night:
CLOSE UP - JENNIFER'S EYEBALL: A beam of light slides across it.
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS: The Resident tucks his flashlight in a pocket, draws a pin from his lapel. Gently sticks Jennifer's cheek. Willy winces, watching.
INT. HOSPITAL - LOBBY - THE NEXT MORNING: Crawford comes in through the lobby: rested, well-dressed.   A free man. He slows, surprised - - seeing Willy come off the elevators. Willy hasn't left Jennifer's bedside. He's in the same suit and carrying his briefcase from the courthouse.
INT. WOOTON SIMS - RECEPTION - LATER THAT MORNING: Willy - still unshaved, unslept, in yesterday's suit - comes off the elevator, fishing out ID as he passes a RECEPTIONIST:
INT. WOOTON SIMS - BUILDING STAIRWAY - SOON AFTER: Willy runs down the stairs furiously - - the clanging alarm, several floors above now, a little fainter. He suddenly stops - clinging to the railing, bent over.    He sways, dizzy, gasping - - backs up until he's against the concrete wall. Presses himself against. Listening to his own ragged breathing. Scared out of his mind.
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DUSK: Crawford stands by the bed, glancing over a set of forms on a metal clipboard. DR. LUNT, a senior neurologist, and a HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR wait. The machines hiss and click, keeping Jennifer alive. Crawford signs the forms, expressionless.
EXT. COURTHOUSE - THE SAME TIME: Willy's walking alongside Judge Robinson, as they leave the building. The Judge is wearing his "civilian clothes."
PROTECTING HER?!: The Judge stops - giving Willy a hard eye: I'm sympathetic, but yelling at me is not a smart approach. Willy looks at the Judge a second - hapless, frustrated, scared - then nods and shakes his head and turns away - hurrying off through the homeward-bound crowds. The Judge watches him go.   Grimaces.
INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - KITCHEN - THAT EVENING: Crawford is carefully preparing an elegant, solitary meal. Music plays on his state-of-the-art sound system. He stops, noticing a pair of Jennifer's reading glasses, folded up by a note-pad and pen next to the telephone. He picks them up. Stylish, feminine. He goes to the trash, steps on the pedal to flip open the lid, and drops the glasses in. Goes back to cooking.
INT. LOBRUTO HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT: Lobruto - at the dinner table with his family - looks up, surprised, as the doorbell rings. He excuses himself - - goes to open the door. Willy's outside: apologetic but urgent, near the end of his rope.
EXT. LOBRUTO HOUSE - CONTINUOUS: We move with Willy out to the quiet street. The windows of the houses he passes seem warm and safe - and very far away. Behind him, Lobruto watches from his lighted doorway. Willy walks, shaken, determined, into the night.
INT. HOSPITAL - I.C.U. - THE NEXT MORNING: A NURSE checks Jennifer Crawford's vital signs. She then begins to gently wash Jennifer's face, where it's not taped or bandaged. The monitor beeps, the ventilator hisses.
INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - THE SAME TIME: Crawford knots his necktie, studying himself in the mirror. Expressionless.
EXT. GARDNER HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - SOON AFTER: Judge Gardner pulls his car out to the street - - swerving hastily, as Willy's car skids alongside and forces him to the curb, horn honking. Willy pulls to a stop, blocking Gardner's way, and gets out of the car - holding up both palms: just wait.
INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - LATER THAT MORNING: Dr. Lunt takes a chart from the I.C.U. Nurses' Station.
INT. CRAWFORD'S CAR - SOON AFTER: Crawford drives, wearing a dark suit, sunglasses.   Calm.
INT. JUDGE GARDNER'S CHAMBERS - SAME TIME: Willy watches GARDNER'S SECRETARY bring in a document, fresh off the laser-printer. As Gardner signs:
INT. PARKING STRUCTURE - DOWNTOWN L.A. - CONTINUOUS: Willy brakes as he drives around a corner and sees a DRIVER wrangling with the BOOTH GUY. He grimaces, looks around - - backs up, tires squealing, heading for another exit.
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS: Dr. Lunt stands by Jennifer's bed, supervising the Nurse and an Orderly as they prepare her.
INT. HOSPITAL - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS: Crawford walks in, goes toward the elevators.
INT. WILLY'S CAR - INTERSECTION - CONTINUOUS: He floors it, racing under a light going red - narrowly misses getting broad-sided.
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS: Dr. Lunt looks up from making notes on Jennifer's chart, as Crawford enters the room.
EXT. EMERGENCY ROOM ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS: Willy pulls into a NO PARKING zone and jumps out, papers in hand - tossing the keys to an ORDERLY smoking a cigarette -
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS: Standing beside Dr. Lunt, Crawford watches, expressionless - - as the Nurse and the Orderly work, efficient and silent, disconnecting the oxygen tubes, unplugging the monitor -
INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - SOON AFTER: Willy dodges people, coming to the elevators - which open. Too crowded.
INT. HOSPITAL STAIRWAY - SOON AFTER: Willy gasps a little as he hurries up the stairs -
INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - SOON AFTER: - comes out of the fire stairs, hurrying toward I.C.U. -
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS: - and into Jennifer's room, where he stops.     Shocked. The bed is being stripped, the equipment rolled out. Willy stares, breathless, overwhelmed.
EXT. HOSPITAL ROOF - HELIPAD - LATER: A Sikorsky S-76 Medevac chopper is preparing to take off, very loud and windy. Through the open doorway and the thick windows, we can glimpse Crawford sitting beside Jennifer, who is strapped on to a gurney. She's connected to life-support equipment. The MED TECH is outside, checking a few last supplies and giving Crawford a moment alone with his wife. Crawford moves. He may be whispering to her.    Or adjusting her pillow. Hard to tell. As he climbs out of the chopper - - he sees Willy across the roof, arguing with Dr. Lunt, who is skimming the court documents, shaking his head. Crawford, curious, walks toward the two men.
EXT. HOSPITAL ROOF HELIPAD - WILLY - THE SAME TIME: Dr. Lunt hands Crawford the court order. As Crawford reads them, Lunt and Willy shout over the helicopter engine:
INT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS: Willy bends, coming to the door - wind-whipped, flinching. Crawford holds out a hand to help him in. Willy doesn't move.   The PILOT glances back. Crawford's eyes are locked with Willy's. Willy stares at Crawford, scared. But unable to back down from the crude, plain challenge. Which Crawford is clearly counting on. Angry, at himself, Willy climbs in without taking Crawford's hand. As he nervously figures out how to buckle himself in -
EXT. ABOVE LOS ANGELES - SOON AFTER: Looking directly down at the Sikorsky as it glides over a picturesque mapscape of streets and freeways, gray and terra- cotta rooftops, blue kidneys and rectangles of pool.
INT. HELICOPTER - SAME TIME: Willy watches Crawford, who stares back at him.       Calm. Glances uneasily at the Pilot, bug-headed in sun-goggles and headphones. Flying them, calm. The Med Tech, adjusting Jennifer's portable ventilator. Calm.
EXT. ABOVE LOS ANGELES - SOON AFTER: The Sikorsky glides over cross-hatched parking lots, a pale swath of beach - - and the white foaming edge of the Pacific.
INT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS: Willy looks up from the view.       Scared.   Yells to the Pilot.
EXT. ABOVE THE OCEAN - SOON AFTER: Deep dark vast blue.   The Sikorsky flies over.      Small.
INT. HELICOPTER - SOON AFTER: Willy stares into Crawford's eyes.
CRAWFORD: No extraordinary measures. (Turns to Willy) Unless your court order specifies
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON BACK THERE?!: - the Med Tech holding Willy down on the floor by Jennifer's stretcher - Willy struggles furiously -
INT. WILLY'S APARTMENT - A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER: The garage door is open, letting in daylight. We can see the alley especially well, because there are only empty hangers on the clothes-bar, and the cinderblock shelves have been taken apart, stacked on the floor. Willy is packing.    He's wearing jeans, an old t-shirt. He carries a heavy pile of legal textbooks out to the trash bins, throws them away.
EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS: Lobruto is walking toward his car when Willy steps out of the garage and calls after him:
INT. S.I.D. LAB - LATER: End of the day. Marchand pulls on his coat, shuts down his computer. He turns to go - - Willy is standing in his doorway.
INT. POLICE EVIDENCE WAREHOUSE - SOON AFTER: Willy follows an EVIDENCE CLERK along an aisle between floor- to-ceiling steel shelves of boxes marked with case numbers.
INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - THAT NIGHT: Crawford is building a new Rube Goldberg device, tools and parts laid out precisely on a table. Eyes enlarged by the glasses, he silently connects two tiny pieces of metal -
INT. S.I.D. LAB - NIGHT (FLASHBACK): Marchand, on the phone - holding the gun Crawford surrendered, in its plastic EVIDENCE bag:
INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (RESUME): Crawford is getting edgy, watching Willy study Nunally's gun:
INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (FLASHBACK): Nunally setting down his pistol on the chair - as Crawford, across the room, sets down his on the table.
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY (FLASHBACK): Surveillance-cam view: Crawford lets himself into the room -
INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK): Crawford quietly closes the door behind him.     Stands, taking it all in -
INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (RESUME): Willy looks at Crawford.    Stunned.
INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK): Crawford checks the dresser drawers, the night-table - finds Nunally's badge, holster and gun.
INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (RESUME): Beat.   Crawford shrugs - arrogant:
INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - (FLASHBACKS - VERY QUICK): Crawford fires at Jennifer - Crawford shoots at the transom -
INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (RESUME): Willy turns, looking into the alcove:
INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (FLASHBACK): Nunally rushes past Crawford to kneel by Jennifer - shocked, frantic -
INT.
