SEIGEL: Hello. I'm Howard Seigel, National Transportation Safety Board vice chairmen. We've notified your families and they are on their way. Does anyone feel they need medical attention or spiritual counseling at this time?

WEINE: It may be valuable to our rescue attempts, or any potential... criminal investigation.
SCHRECK: You said... (checks notes) "Listen to me! This plane will explode on take-off." (to Alex) How did you know that?
ALEX: I got this... feeling... a weird feeling... I can't explain it...
WEINE: Did you take any seditives before boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping pills?
ALEX: No. I saw it. I saw it!
ALEX: Not like a dream... more than that.
ALEX (CONT'D): I'm not a pyschic... I've never had this happen before...
SCHRECK: Did this "weird feeling" have anything to do with you saying you wished Carter Horton was on the plane... just before it exploded?
ALEX: No!
SCHRECK: Why'd you say it?
ALEX: Because... I... never thought it
WEINE: If that's the case, Alex... why did

MS. LEWTON: Larry Murnau told me to get back (pause, guiltily) I sent him back on the plane.
WEINE: No one forced you to get off the plane. You told us you aren't friends with any that did... so, why did you leave the airplane?
CLEAR: Because I saw and I heard Alex. And... I believed him.
CLEAR: Here's good.
CLEAR: Thank you for the ride.
MINISTER (V.O.): Thirty-nine days have passed since we've lost our thirty-nine loved ones, friends, and teachers.

CLEAR (CONT'D): (a warning) Get outta here!
ALEX: What... what happened?
MR. WAGGNER: Didn't you... "see" it?
MR. WAGGNER (CONT'D): Couldn't you "predict" it? Couldn't you read his mind?
ALEX: Mr. Waggner...
MR. WAGGNER: You caused Tod so much guilt over (breaking down) He took his own life.
ALEX: He wouldn't do it!

ALEX: Why were you there last night?
CLEAR: Look, I've seen enough T.V. to know the F.B.I. doesn't investigate teen suicides. But they were there last people got off the plane is probably suspicious. And it doesn't help that
ALEX: Why were you there last night?
CLEAR: Know what this is?
CLEAR: It's you.
CLEAR: Not a likeness. It's how you make
ALEX: I'm... really sorry.

CLEAR: Then, let's go see him!
CLEAR: (whispering) Gives me a rush...
ALEX: This place?!
CLEAR: Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.
CLEAR: Good call. Very "Quincy."
ALEX: That... him?

ALEX: That's him, but... he's not here.
MR. BLUDWORTH (O.S.): Please don't yell...
MR. BLUDWORTH: You'll wake the dead.
ALEX: Why..?
MR. BLUDWORTH: Chemicals in the vascular flush create cadaveric spasm.
ALEX: I'm... a friend of his. His best friend. See, his father...

MR. BLUDWORTH: No harm. No foul.
CLEAR: We didn't find what we were looking for.
ALEX: Yeah, we did.
MR. BLUDWORTH: I'll see you soon.
CLEAR (O.S.): The mortician was whacked.
CLEAR (CONT'D): He was trippin' on formaldehyde.
ALEX: He said Death has a design. Even before he said that I had been seeing patterns.
CLEAR: (sarcastic) As in flannels and plaids?
ALEX: How many died on Flight 180? From our group?
CLEAR: Thirty-nine.
ALEX: Remember the gate number?
CLEAR: No.
ALEX: Thirty-nine.
ALEX: Remember the departure time?
CLEAR: Like... 4:25.
ALEX (V.O.): Do you know when I was born?
ALEX: Right. April 25th.
CLEAR: Wait. I thought you meant the time of your birth. Four/Twenty-five, as in, month and day... that's a reach.
ALEX: My birthday is the same as of the
CLEAR: You're sounding like those people who, you know... "Oswald shot
ALEX: I'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of... would

CLEAR: I don't understand... did you see
ALEX: No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.

ALEX: The mortician said Death has a (beat) But what if it was our time, what if

TERRY: Carter...
CARTER: Kind of have a reunion, here.
TERRY: Let it go!
CARTER: When are you moving?
MS. LEWTON: A couple of weeks.
CARTER: We're losing our favorite teacher.
ALEX: Look, there's something you should all know.

KEN (CONT'D): She's concerned about you. (beat) I'm concerned about you.
KEN (CONT'D): Why don't you want to talk to her... or me?
ALEX: Dad... you and mom have helped me out, so much. But there's... some things I need to understand before I can talk... to anyone about it.
CNN ANCHOR (O.S.): The National Transportation Safety Board has a new theory tonight on the possible cause of Euro-Air Flight 180...
CNN ANCHOR (CONT'D, V.O.): Deterioration of silicon insulation on an electrical connector to the scavenger pump may have leaked combustible fluids.
CNN ANCHOR (CONT'D, V.O.): A spark in the fuel switch...
ALEX (O.S.): That's Tod's seat...
CNN ANCHOR (CONT'D, V.O.): ... may have ignited the fuel line. And proceeded to the fuel pump.
ALEX: The path of the explosion... (a whisper) That's Death's design.
MS. LEWTON (O.S.): Some nights I'm woken up by the
MS. LEWTON (CONT'D): Everything here reminds me... of memories, you know... but now all I
MS. LEWTON: (quickly) Laura, I gotta call you back.
MS. LEWTON (CONT'D): This is Valerie Lewton. I need Agent Schreck...
SCHRECK: What are you doing?
ALEX: Checking the air in her tires to make sure they're safe.
SCHRECK: Get in the car.
ALEX: I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.
WEINE: "Next?"
ALEX: Yes... see, there's this...
WEINE: (sarcastic) Oh, you've noticed it, too?
MS. LEWTON: Oh... mom's favorite.
JOHN DENVER (V.O.): He was born in the summer of his twenty-seventh year...
SCHRECK: Where'd you get this "pattern" from?
ALEX: I didn't ask for what happened to me on the plane. You can make fun of me. You can think I'm a nut. I'm used to
ALEX: I'm not suffering from Post Traumatic Stress. I haven't developed a narcissistic deity complex. I'm not (beat) This just is. There's a pattern in
ALEX: (sighs) And I'm not sure yet how... but I intend to break this one.
JOHN DENVER (V.O.): He left yesterday behind him/ You might say he's born again...
WEINE: Alex, you got our attention, at first, because you were under suspicion in the plane explosion.
WEINE (CONT'D): I know you didn't blow up that plane.
WEINE (CONT'D): I don't believe you have magical
WEINE (CONT'D): Alex... can you promise me that
ALEX: No... I can't. As long as I'm in
WEINE: Alright, go on. Get outta here.
SCHRECK: Kid gives me the creeps.
WEINE: We got nothing to hold him.
SCHRECK: I don't mean that... (beat) There's a couple of times, there... I almost believed him.
WEINE: Sometimes, you give me the creeps.

JOHN DENVER (V.O.): It's the Colorado Rocky Mountain High...
JOHN DENVER: I've seen it rainin' fire from the sky...
JOHN DENVER (V.O.): Rocky Mountain High/ Colorad-oh.
ALEX (O.S.): Ms. Lewton!
JOHN DENVER (V.O.): They say that he got crazy once and
ALEX: Ms. Lewton!
BILLY: Hey, Alex...
CLEAR: I don't know where he is. He's not talking to me.
WEINE: Why?
CLEAR: Because I didn't believe him.
SCHRECK: If he should contact you, it would be in the best interest of your own safety to contact us.
CLEAR: What are you doing?
CARTER: Terry's name should be on this wall.
CARTER (CONT'D): So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
CLEAR: They're watching me, see if I go to
BILLY: Are you?
CLEAR: They'll follow my car. (beat) That's why you're taking me.
CARTER: Why would I want to see him?
CLEAR: Because he knows which one of us is next.
BILLY: Um... okay... drive the speed limit, right?
BILLY (CONT'D): And don't pass on the right.
CARTER: Billy! I'm gettin' a vision! You're the next one...
CARTER: 'Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!

CLEAR: And that is the only way we can beat
ALEX: This won't be safe.
ALEX: No.. I mean, I don't have anything
CLEAR: (sadly) Nothing is... anymore.
ALEX: I can't go home. After Lewton's, they'll be after me.
CLEAR: We're takin' you to a cabin in the woods, it's only a couple miles from my house. (to Carter) Keep off the highways, they'll be
CARTER: Alright, Browning, you fuckin'
ALEX: Why do you think I was hiding?
CLEAR: Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you
ALEX: They blame me for everything. Her,
BILLY: Your shoe prints were in the blood.
ALEX: I already told you...
CARTER: (interrupting) I'm not talkin' about if you did it. Or if you knew she was dead... (beat) Did you know she was going to be
ALEX: (quietly) Yeah. (almost to himself) When she died... at that moment, I could tell she saw something... horrible.
CARTER: Out of us... who's next to see it?
BILLY: Please tell me I'm gonna get to see the Jets win the Super Bowl.
CARTER: Me, right? That's why you're not
BILLY: Shoulda felt up Tammy in the pool, that time...
CARTER: (to Billy) Whatta you whinin' about? He said I'm next.
CLEAR: He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
CARTER: You have a responsibility to tell me.
ALEX: Is knowing going to make it easier?
CARTER: You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
ALEX: It doesn't matter who's next... we're all on the same list.
CARTER: Aww, fuck... really?
CARTER: Then why bother? What's the fuckin' point? Terry and me will be back together on the other side, so why wait any longer?
CLEAR: Knock it off!
CARTER: May as well go out under my own free will, right?
CLEAR: Not with us in the fuckin' car!
CLEAR                    BILLY: Stop it!                Hey, c'mon, man...
CARTER: What's your fuckin' worry? If it's wouldn't get shit! Only me, right?

CARTER: I can't get out!
BILLY: Man, he really is next.
CLEAR: Scared now?
CARTER: It broke!
CLEAR: (to Carter) Bullshit. He saved your life...again!
CARTER: Jesus fucking Christ!
ALEX: (to Carter) You should have been next. After Lewton, you should've been next.
CARTER: You're the fuckin' devil.
ALEX: (to Clear) But I saved him. I intervened. Just
CLEAR: Police are coming.
ALEX: That's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; Billy.
ALEX (CONT'D): My intervention in the death of 180 surviviors will cheat the design.
CARTER: "Intervention?" What are you, God now?!
ALEX: Of course not! Gods aren't afraid to die! Gods don't die! We do!
CLEAR: You're losin' it. The police will be here. We have to go to the cabin. You can hide there. Get your head
ALEX: After Billy... it's me. And then you.
ALEX (CONT'D): (to Clear) Hey, I won't let it happen, okay.
CARTER: Then, get out of here.
ALEX: (as if to Death) Rusted. Tetanus. Nice touch. (defiant) I overlooked it. You tried to capitalize. But I caught you, you fuck. I can beat you. Not forever, but I got this cabin rigged to beat you NOW!
WEINE: She was up there a minute ago...
CLEAR: I'm not turning him in. There's another life that needs him now.
CLEAR: I go with you.
WEINE: You can't.
CLEAR: Don't hurt him.
WEINE: Tell us where he is. Wait at home,
ALEX: I... never moved. Christa asked me to move, but I didn't change seats. I would've moved up... next to Tod... How could I not remember... that... I never moved. Clear's seat was in front of mine...
ALEX (CONT'D): She's next.
SCHRECK: There!
CLEAR: Run!
WEINE: (into radio) Lost him.
SCHRECK: From the direction... there's only
ALEX: Don't move!
ALEX: You're grounded in the car. Don't touch anything. DON'T MOVE.
WEINE: Alex, get away from there!
SCHRECK: Any part of that line touches you, you're dead.
WEINE: Get back! You'll both die!
ALEX: You know what to do.
CLEAR: No! No! Don't!
ALEX: When I do this.. it'll have skipped
ALEX: You know what to do. I'll always be
SCHRECK: Is he alive?
DOCTOR: A little more. Little more!
DOCTOR: He's here. A beautiful boy.
CLEAR: I felt him! When the baby was born... I felt Alex pass through me... like the night he died...
DOCTOR: 13th of May... 4:25 p.m.
BARBARA: Exactly a year... to the minute.
CLEAR: We beat it, Alex.
CARTER: Alex was right.
CARTER (CONT'D): It did skip us.
CLEAR: I believe... that's what Alex believed. But how do we know... this wasn't the design all along?
