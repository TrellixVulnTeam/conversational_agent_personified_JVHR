HITCHCOCK: Written by John J. McLaughlin Based on the book Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho by Stephen Rebello
ED GEIN: You can't leave us, Henry. She needs both
HENRY GEIN: Can you stop being a momma's boy for one second? Henry looks at Ed and he shrinks back.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: in his trademark black Mariani suit. He's been watching the whole thing, standing in the smouldering field only a few feet away, holding a rose-patterned cup and saucer of tea...
(CONTINUED): He takes a sip and turns to address the camera --
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Good evening. He places his cup daintily back on the saucer.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Mere Technicolor baubles. He shudders with distaste. As if on cue the sky THUNDERS LOUDLY above him. He looks up and from behind the tree stump produces an umbrella.
(CONTINUED): As Hitch opens his brolly and the RAIN starts to bucket down
LEW WASSERMAN: This thing is going to be gigantic. I wish I had twenty percent of the take. Lew hustles them through the throng of REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS under their BLACK UMBRELLAS.
REPORTER ONE: Does tonight's incredible reaction surprise you, Mr. Hitchcock?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: No, when I was planning North by Northwest I could already hear the screams and laughter. (then, to a BEAUTIFUL
BLONDE FAN): Any questions, my dear? The blonde fan, holding out her autograph book, shakes her head `no' and giggles.
(CONTINUED): The reporters crack up. Alma manages a polite smile as Lew helps her into the limo, leaving Hitchcock alone for a moment to sign his autograph for the blond fan...
REPORTER TWO: Mr. Hitchcock, you've directed forty-six motion pictures. You host a hit TV show seen around the world. You're the most famous director in the history of the medium... but you're sixty years old. Shouldn't you just quit while you're ahead?
HITCHCOCK: soaks in the tub. The champagne glass beside him, his corpulent frame is covered only by the London Times he's reading. Even in this deeply vulnerable state, he maintains the air of a haughty mischievous emperor. At the sound of a bedroom bureau being opened, Hitch's eyes shift to the FULL-LENGTH MIRROR on the bathroom door.
ALMA: Muhammad had the eyes of peeping Toms gouged out with arrows. Hitchcock clears his throat, rattling his paper as if he'd been reading the whole time.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Talking of arrows, did you read Mr. Weiler's review in the New York Times? Apparently, he found "the climax" to be -- and I quote -- "overdrawn."
ALMA: I doubt whether Mr. Weiler has had a climax in years. Alma steps into her skirt as Hitch opens the London Times.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: And how about this little grenade?
(READING): North by Northwest reminds us of Hitchcock's earlier, more youthfully inventive spy thrillers."
(BEAT): And just to drive the nail into the coffin, there's a handy accompanying guide to the new masters of suspense. Hitchcock zeroes in on the photographs. They're all young. Thinner. And with hair.
ALMA: Don't be maudlin, you know how much it aggravates me. He catches his reflection in the mirror again and sinks further down into the water to hide his protruding belly. Alma comes in, takes the newspapers from him and puts them on the side.
ALMA (CONT'D): Stop reading them. You've been reading them for a week now. She puts down the TOILET SEAT and sits on it.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Tell me, dear. Am I really too old?
ALMA: Yes. A true relic. And lest we forget, a notably corpulent one. She comes over and kisses the top of his head.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: You always know precisely where to plunge the dagger, don't you?
ALMA: Right between the shoulder blades. I learned it from your pictures. She moves off to the mirror to apply lipstick and Hitchcock surreptitiously picks up the papers again...
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Where are you off to?
ALMA: I'm seeing Whit for brunch after I drop you off at the studio. Why don't you join us?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: We've just established that I'm too corpulent to be seen in broad daylight.
ALMA: You'll feel better as soon as you find a project. Hasn't Peggy unearthed any decent books yet?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Sleeping pills with dust jackets. Alma steps back to inspect herself in the full-length mirror. Today's outfit is, we sense, rather more stylish than what she would ordinarily wear.
ALMA: Well? Hitch's gaze never leaves the photo gallery of his younger rivals in the `New Masters of Suspense' article...
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Very presentable.
ON ALMA: As she elegantly masks her hurt.
ALMA: Hurry up, darling. You're pruning. She leaves. Hitch grumbles and tosses his paper aside. He rises from the depths but suddenly loses his balance and grabs onto the SHOWER CURTAIN, wrenching it from the METAL RINGS on the rod. A GOD'S EYE view, looking down, as Hitchcock stares up at the metal rings SPINNING NOISILY on the metal rod.
FIRST GUARD: Mr. Hitchcock. Mrs. Hitchcock. Alma waves from the wheel of a GLEAMING BLACK 1957 CADILLAC. Hitchcock sits next to her. He has his two SEALYHAM TERRIERS on his lap. He nods, awaiting more.
ALMA: There's a story out there waiting for you somewhere, Hitch. I promise. He gives her a good-bye peck and opens the door.
ALMA (CONT'D): Don't forget your lunch. Alma hands him a compact Fortnum & Mason basket and pats him on his girth. He opens it to discover CELERY AND CARROT STICKS wrapped in Saran.
OMITTED: Luxurious, wood-paneled and very British. Hitch sits restlessly behind his desk, receiving his morning shave from his private barber, SILVIO. His longtime assistant, PEGGY ROBERTSON, 40s, crisp, British, fiercely protective of her boss, is going through a list of potential projects.
PEGGY: Fox is offering you The Diary of Anne Frank for the third time. Hitch directs his response to Silvio.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: The audience would spend the entire picture waiting for Miss Frank to discover the corpse I'd hidden in the attic. Wouldn't you agree, Silvio?
SILVIO: Si. Hitch reaches for a carrot stick and CRUNCHES it.
PEGGY: MGM wants you for the Ian Fleming book, Casino Royale, with Cary Grant. Definitely your style.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: (again, turning to Silvio) Doesn't she know I just made that movie? It's called North by Northwest. And "style" is merely self-plagiarism. Silvio nods, then recommences the shave.
PEGGY: I'll see what I can find. Hitch motions for the barber to hold up the mirror. The image of his face overflows the small frame. Repulsed, he leans back his head and makes a hand motion for Silvio to SLIT HIS
WHITFIELD COOK: ... Thank God I had a pocketful of pretzels. I was hiding in that props cupboard all night.
(THEN): That'll teach me to use a bedroom set instead of the real thing.
ALMA: Serves you right. They laugh uproariously, quite at ease with each other.
ALMA (CONT'D): Hitch always said your private life was in danger of being more entertaining than any of your plots. He pours Alma another glass of wine, not remotely insulted.
WHITFIELD COOK: I can't believe he let me have you all to myself for a whole afternoon. Especially looking this beautiful. He clinks her glass.
ALMA: All this relentless sycophancy is giving me indigestion.
ALMA (CONT'D): What are you after? He laughs, his eyes straying to a PRETTY WAITRESS passing by. Alma notices.
ALMA (CONT'D): And how is your wife?
WHITFIELD COOK: Elizabeth? (his eyes return to Alma) Over the moon since I promised her the dedication in my new novel. So what are you working on these days?
ALMA: Hitch is going out of his mind looking for his next project. You know how unbearable he is when he doesn't have something lined up.
WHITFIELD COOK: Almost as unbearable as when he does.
ALMA: Almost.
WHITFIELD COOK: I meant you. What are you working on?
ALMA: I'm satisfied spending time in my garden.
WHITFIELD COOK: That is one lucky garden. Whit brings out a set of galleys and slides them across the tablecloth to her.
ALMA: Ah. All is finally revealed.
(CONTINUED): He touches her hand, affectionately. She brushes it away, affectionately...
WHITFIELD COOK: The most fun I ever had was working with you. She looks through the opening pages... taking her time... enjoying making him wait...
ALMA: I suppose I could give it a look.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Anything. Anything at all? He starts sifting through her tray. She notices the glass in his hand.
PEGGY: Nothing suitable. Is that water or do I need to call Alma? He drains it playfully.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Gin. Mother's ruin. But something's caught his eye. A circled review of Anthony Boucher's column "CRIMINAL MINDS" in the New York Times Review of Books. He picks it up.
PEGGY: It sounds ghastly. Everyone in town's already passed.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: And who is everyone?
PEGGY: The story department finished the coverage this morning.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Is this the one based on Ed Gein, the serial killer? He takes the coverage and reads for himself.
PEGGY: You're kidding.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Peggy. This is the boy who dug up his own mother.
ON HITCH: Completely engrossed as he sits reading "Psycho" in a chair by the fire of his elegant Bel Air home. He takes another gulp of wine when he hears Alma enter and slides the wine glass out of view. Alma pops her head in the door.
ALMA: Hungry?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Famished. She disappears to take off her coat.
(CONTINUED): She comes back in again carrying some galleys, notices the title of Hitch's book -- some trash called "Psycho."
ALMA (CONT'D): Whit gave me the galleys of his new book yesterday at lunch. I've already got some ideas on how you could adapt it. Hitch continues reading.
ALMA (CONT'D): It's elegant, sophisticated, full of
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: The book or Mr. Whitfield Cook? She taps Hitch's book dismissively with the galleys of "Taxi to Dubrovnik."
ALMA: This might be the one, Alfred. He finally looks up.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Leave it on the night stand. As she leaves she points to Hitch's `hidden' wine glass.
ALMA: There are calories in that, you know. But Hitch ignores her and turns to look out the window, his imagination starting to turn...
ED GEIN: Aren't you cold, ma? She doesn't answer. We follow him to the dresser where he lingers a little too long over his mother's open underwear drawer before grabbing the blue coverlet on the side. He comes over and spreads the extra blanket over her. Still wearing his jacket, he takes off his shoes, gets into bed and crawls up next to her.
ALMA: Oh God. The look of obsession on his face is unmistakable.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Read the bit in the motel bathroom.
ALMA: Now? He switches on the light by her bedside. She sits up, puts on her glasses and reads from the opened page.
ALMA (CONT'D): "Mary started to scream, and then the curtains parted further and a hand appeared, holding a butcher's knife. It was the knife that, a moment later, cut off her scream... and her head." (handing him back the book) Charming. Doris Day should do it as a musical. She hands him back the book.
ALMA (CONT'D): This is nothing but low-budget horror movie claptrap. She turns off the light again and goes back to bed. A deep voice sounds from the darkness...
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: But what if someone really good made a horror movie?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Just think of the shock value. Killing off your leading lady halfway through. Alma can feel Hitch looking at her, waiting for a response. Clearly he isn't going to let this one go.
ALMA: Actually, I think it's a huge mistake. Hitch falls silent, a chastised schoolboy.
ALMA (CONT'D): You shouldn't wait till halfway through... Kill her off after 30 minutes.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Peggy, I want you to summon your minions...
PEGGY: Minions. Certainly. And who might they be...? Hitch heads for his office, in no mood for wise cracks. He spreads out the articles on the desk. Photos and magazine articles about Ed Gein...
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Get them started buying copies of "Psycho." Peggy stands in the doorway, watching --
PEGGY: How many do you need?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: All of them. I want every copy, nationwide.
PEGGY: All that celery's affecting your brain. She walks over, notices the LIFE MAGAZINE headline : "HOUSE OF HORRORS STUNS NATION." Stark black and white photographs expose the nightmarish decay of the Gein house...
PEGGY (CONT'D): Are you sure about this? This is so unlike you.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: That's exactly the point, my dear. Peggy watches uneasily as Hitchcock pores over the articles with delight.
HITCHCOCK: Is now in position in front of the fire place. Around the coffee table are INVITED GOSSIP COLUMNISTS, including a HEDDA HOPPER-TYPE. They take in the gory LIFE MAGAZINE article.
HITCHCOCK: That is my intention, madam. Yes. Hitch taps the photo of ED GEIN.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I only wish he looked more like William Holden and less like Elmer Fudd. The other columnists scribble down the quote.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I was hoping everyone would. I mean life is deeply offensive and disgusting, isn't it? Hitch glides off without missing a beat, past the Servers arriving with more hors d'oeuvres from the kitchen.
PEGGY: ... How she deals with a demanding boss when she's trying to relax on her weekends off? Hitchcock doesn't notice the joke. He now only has eyes on the pantry ahead. He forges on through the guests only to get waylaid by Lew. It is a classic Hitchcock moment, a character needing to get someplace being held up by someone who wants to chat --
LEW WASSERMAN: (re: the faces of the
GOSSIP COLUMNISTS): I told you, Hitch. This thing's strictly for the drive-in crowd. Hitch smiles tightly and extricates himself, heading on to the kitchen through more annoying guests --
WHITFIELD COOK: Now, if this were a Hitchcock picture what would two characters like us, married to other people, be saying?
ALMA: You don't have to pretend you're not upset he hasn't read it yet, you know.
WHITFIELD COOK: I'm a big boy. I can take it.
ALMA: Well, I loved it. What terrific fun it must have been to research.
WHITFIELD COOK: Certainly more fun than reading those reviews.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I wonder how that could have happened. Hitch sips his martini, a picture of innocence. Then leans in to Whit's ear and whispers - just like Whit leaned into Alma's ear a moment earlier.
LEW WASSERMAN: I've seen happier faces on a school bus going over a cliff.
PEGGY: I told you it would be too much.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: But they can't stop looking, can they? He slurps his martini, sharing a smile with Lew.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Audiences want to be shocked, Barney. They want something different. And this is it. He gestures to the untouched copy of "Psycho" in front of Balaban.
BARNEY BALABAN: The truth is, Hitch, every time you want to do something "different" like The Wrong Man or Vertigo, someone loses money. Hitchcock stares unblinking, giving nothing away.
LEW WASSERMAN: So we should stop trying to give them something new?
BARNEY BALABAN: You owe Paramount one last picture, Hitch. Can't you do something like North by Northwest but for us this time instead of for MGM? Hitch's stare remains inscrutable.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: "Psycho." Wasserman gives Balaban the same glacial stare. The Paramount executives shift uncomfortably.
BARNEY BALABAN: No one respects the name Hitchcock more than Paramount. But even a talented man sometimes backs the wrong horse.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Are you telling me "no?" Balaban maintains a calm, pleasant front.
BARNEY BALABAN: I think you know me better than that, Hitch. I would never say "no" to you. Hitch's suppressed rage is building...but Balaban says nothing.
LEW WASSERMAN: What a putz. You know what his family did before they built those movie palaces? Ran a grocery store.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: My father ran a grocery store.
LEW WASSERMAN: Exactly. That's what I'm saying. He should show some respect. Hitch turns to Lew.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: They think I've lost my touch, Lew. My association with television has cheapened me.
LEW WASSERMAN: Are you referring to that deal I got you where Bristol-Meyers pays you twenty-nine grand an episode and you own the negative? That's my kind of cheap.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: They just want the same thing over and over. They've put me in a coffin and now they're nailing down the lid. Lew puts a comforting hand on him...
LEW WASSERMAN: Hitch, I will never let that happen.
(CONTINUED): Hitch doesn't respond, Lew sensing the true depth of his friend's melancholy.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Eight hundred thousand... Give or take. Lew digests the figure...
LEW WASSERMAN: I have whisky in the car.
ALMA: You're back early. He shrugs, then sits at the table to pour himself a glass of lemonade. Alma gets out and towels herself off.
ALMA (CONT'D): I'm disappointed you didn't give Whit's book a chance.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: What about him?
ALMA: He knows you well enough. She sits down next to him, noticing a tiny hole in her swimsuit. It's starting to look a little threadbare.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Enjoy the pool now. We might not have it for that much longer. He looks off cryptically.
ALMA: Why?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Paramount refuses to finance the movie. Imagine -- The studio that brought you Martin and Lewis and The Greatest Show On Earth considers Psycho distasteful. He brushes some fallen leaves off his chair.
ALMA: Why not wait? He doesn't reply. She knows him well enough too and doesn't question him further.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: We're going to have to go it alone, old girl.
(BEAT): We'll finance the movie ourselves.
ALMA: Are we going to have to sell the entire house or just the pool? She looks at Hitch but he's not joking. She turns to survey their beloved home and gardens. A long pause.
ALMA (CONT'D): Tell me and I won't ever ask again. Why this one, Hitch? It's not just because so many people are telling you 'no,' is it? Pause.
ALMA (CONT'D): Hitch? Without turning he takes her hand.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Remember the fun we had when we started out and there was so little money and time? We took risks, we experimented. We invented new ways of making pictures because we had to. A long moment as he gazes across the pool.
LEW WASSERMAN: We finance it. Independently. Paramount only distributes it...in exchange for 40 percent of the profits.
BARNEY BALABAN: Interesting. But tell us, what exactly is Paramount distributing? Is this still a picture about a queer killing people in his mother's dress?
LEW WASSERMAN: What this picture is about is the reputation of Alfred Hitchcock.
BARNEY BALABAN: No-one's arguing that.
LEW WASSERMAN: Barney, it's very simple. This is Mr. Hitchcock's next film. Are you in or are you out? A long silence.
BARNEY BALABAN: Well, obviously you have a lot of passion for this project. Let me talk it over with a few people internally and I'll get back to you.
LEW WASSERMAN: No. Now. Balaban takes in their inscrutable stares. Not unimpressed by their chutzpah, he leans back and puts his hands behind his head, a king in his counting room.
BARNEY BALABAN: Fine. We'll take that deal. If you can get the money... Finally, Hitchcock speaks up :
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: We've already got it, Barney. He pulls out his PERSONAL CHECKBOOK and opens it on the desk. Barney watches as Hitch takes the onyx fountain pen from its mount.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: If this picture fails, Alma, we'll be in for a long, humiliating bout of crow- eating.
ALMA: The movie will be splendid.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Are you sure?
ALMA: Of the movie? Not in the least. But of you? Unquestionably.
JOSEPH STEFANO: Joe Stefano. Good to meet you.
(CONTINUED): Hitchcock leaves Stefano's hand dangling in mid air and sits down at his desk.
PEGGY: I thought only director's assistants needed psychiatrists, not writers. Stefano laughs off the barb and takes a seat as Peggy slips out. The two men stare at each other but Stefano's not remotely intimidated.
JOSEPH STEFANO: Do you see a shrink, Mr. Hitchcock? Hitch's eyes follow a plume of cigar smoke curling up to the ceiling...
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: No. His gaze remains pointedly fixed on the ceiling.
JOSEPH STEFANO: The usual: sex. Rage. My mother. Hitchcock lowers his gaze, suddenly intrigued.
ACCOUNTANT: There's still the federal income tax payments... the property taxes... Not to mention the absence of any salary while he's actually making the film...
ALMA: Stop waffling, Donald. Give it to me straight.
(CONTINUED): The Accountant takes off his glasses, plucking up the courage to look his favorite client in the eye.
ACCOUNTANT: Hitch wasn't exaggerating. If the film's a flop, you're going to have to sell the house. Alma digests this.
ALMA: Where do you suggest we cut?
ACCOUNTANT: Anywhere you can.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I got Joe Stefano to write out the first few scenes. Why don't you take a look? Alma takes Stefano's pages and starts to read...Hitch goes to the fridge and opens the door.
ALMA: We're about to have dinner. You don't need anything else. He shuts the door. Leans against the fridge door. Hitch waits but she gives nothing away...until she off-handedly places the pages on the table...
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Well? She doesn't look up...
ALMA: Hire him.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: The only thing worse than a visit to the dentist is one to the censor.
ALMA: Whatever you do, Alfred, don't lose your temper.
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK: The Code will absolutely not permit you to show a knife penetrating a woman's flesh.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I assure you, Geoffrey, my murders, are always models of taste and discretion.
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK: Is there any improper suggestion of nudity in this murder scene in the shower?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: She won't be nude. She'll be wearing a shower cap. Shurlock makes a note. A man utterly devoid of any sense of humor.
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK: We might accept a shot from outside the bathroom window with Marion in silhouette above the shoulders -- provided the glass is frosted. Hitch greets the suggestion with barely concealed contempt. Shurlock turns the page.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: It's completely necessary. Marion flushes evidence later found by her sister. It's a clue to the girl's disappearance.
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK: No American movie has ever found it "necessary" to show a toilet, let alone to flush it. Hitch turns to Peggy and a Paramount Executive.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Perhaps we ought to shoot the film in France and use a bidet instead? No response from Shurlock's end of the room. Peggy stares down at the table.
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK: Mr. Hitchcock, if this office denies you a seal, and we're certainly heading in that direction, your movie will not be released in a single theater in this country. Will you be making jokes then? Hitchcock gives a slow but meaningful shrug.
ON HITCH: boiling with rage as we hear the flurry of script pages --
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Everyone in Hollywood resents me. I make them millions... and yet every year I sit at those dreadful award show dinners, waiting for them to say, just once, "You're good." He looks around the luxurious office.
ANALYST'S VOICE: That must hurt.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Deeply. Hitch fumbles for a handkerchief and mops his brow.
ANALYST'S VOICE: Take your time. Now Hitch claws at his tie. It's hot in here.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: It's just that, more and more lately, I've been having these... impulses. The analyst's MONTBLANC pen makes a note on a pad. We notice that his hands are surprisingly coarse.
ANALYST'S VOICE: What kind of impulses? Finally Hitchcock is still. He stares up at the ceiling.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Strong ones.
(CONTINUED): He pulls it out it to reveal a hidden stash of foie gras under the hollowed out grapefruit. He's about to devour it when he catches sight of his DISTORTED REFLECTION in the chrome shelving. He backs away, disgusted at this monster before him, the light of the fridge illuminating his expression.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Send them all back to Glendale. Hitch returns to the table to ponder yet more headshots. Peggy shares a glance with Alma, then slides over RODDY
PEGGY: The Lazar Office tells me he's crazy to work with you.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Well, tell "Swifty" he shouldn't have overexposed his client on television.
ALMA: Unlike certain people we could mention. Hitch ignores the barb. Undeterred, Alma pushes her ace card: a photo of ANTHONY PERKINS, radiating offbeat sensitivity and teen idol looks.
ALMA (CONT'D): Think of the duality he could bring to Norman. The rage lurking behind that little-boy-lost grin. The winsome charm he uses to keep from being found out.
PEGGY: Why, Alma, you're not suggesting that Mr. Perkins is -- ? She raises her pinky finger just slightly. Alma nods without judgement.
ON HITCHCOCK: Pondering...
ANTHONY PERKINS: I can't count how many times I've seen Strangers On a Train and Rope.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Well, Norman is the logical extension of the boys in those movies. Appealing, sensitive, suffering the terrible burden of being forced to pretend to be something he is not. Hitchcock's deeply-felt remark lands with Perkins.
ANTHONY PERKINS: My only worry is that playing Norman might cut too close to home.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: How so?
(CONTINUED): Hitch's calmness is strangely reassuring to the young actor...
ANTHONY PERKINS: I was incredibly close to my mother. So close I remember wishing my father would drop dead. And then when I was five, he did just that...He keeled over from a heart attack.
(LAUGHING NERVOUSLY): You see I've been guilty my whole life, Mr. Hitchcock. Hitch is enthralled.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Try to remember this is all just make believe. Perkins wishes he could be more reassured...
ANTHONY PERKINS: Not to be prudish, but how far do you plan to push Norman's relationship with his mother?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Further than you can possibly imagine. On Perkins uncertain expression -- what is he letting himself in for?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I'm getting blisters just looking at you.
ALMA: Stop grumbling. A bit of fresh air and exercise is exactly what you need. He holds his PRUNING SHEARS menacingly over a deep red Sydonie rose.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: If I could get Grace Kelly to play the girl, they'd let me get away with anything.
ALMA: Well you can't. She's a princess now which makes her permanently unattainable. Hitchcock beheads the ROSE, muttering to himself.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: And all the more desirable. His shears are now poised over a yellow specimen.
ALMA: Lew suggested Deborah Kerr.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Too... Scottish. Hitchcock cuts it too and moves on to the stem of a perfect pink rose.
ALMA: What about Janet Leigh? She's always the `good girl' but she did awfully well in Touch of Evil. Lew mentioned her name. Do you remember how you always remarked on her figure at the Wassermans' parties? As the shears hover on the stem, unsure whether to cut...
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Of course the real secret of Mrs. Simpson's appeal to the Duke of Windsor was that she could make a toothpick feel like a cigar. He's so deadpan... it takes a moment before she laughs.
JANET LEIGH: You know, I've been so immersed in preparing to play Marion I'd almost forgotten how to laugh. Hitch summons the waiter with a snap.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Now, you must try the banana shortcake.
JANET LEIGH: Nothing for me, thank you. I'm watching my figure. Alma watches all this with a fixed smile.
ALMA: You're not the only one. (to the waiter) We're fine, thank you. Hitchcock ignores Alma, gesturing to the waiter again.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Bring her the banana shortcake, George. In fact make it two large portions. He pointedly shifts to face Janet.
JANET LEIGH: I've written a complete history for her...It seems silly, but it helps me. She turns to pull a LEATHER NOTEBOOK from her handbag, Hitch's gaze locks onto her silken blonde hair, tied immaculately into the classic `Hitchcock bun'.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: It doesn't sound silly at all. Tell me one of her deepest secrets. A quick look to Alma, as if to ask for permission before :
JANET LEIGH: She leads a double life. For instance, when she works at the Lowery office, she wears Tweed perfume. But, when she and Sam are together, she recklessly breaks out her one expensive bottle -- "My Sin" by Lanvin. She notices Alma's expression.
ALMA: You and the Shurlock Office.
JANET LEIGH: It's just... I mean even if you shoot me from here -- (she indicates a spot just above her bosom) -- well it's not as if my figure is boyish. Hitchcock looks down at her torso, as if noting it for the first time.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Allow me to put your mind at rest. Alma reacts as Hitch reaches over and gives Janet's hand a reassuring squeeze.
ALMA: If you'll excuse me. Alma's had enough. Janet's smile falters as she watches Alma get up and head to the restroom. She's unsure of what just happened but Hitch carries on regardless, either entirely oblivious or not caring at all...
ALMA: Oh, come off it, old girl. A bitchy STUDIO HEAD'S WIFE snaps Alma out of her reverie, joining her at the sink to powder her face.
ALMA: Hello Lillian.
ALMA: Don't upset yourself, darling. It's only a bloody movie.
ALMA: I've made a list of places where we can tighten our belt. She places the list on the table.
ALMA (CONT'D): It wouldn't hurt for us all to learn the art of self restraint. Hitch goes over and picks it up, and reads.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: The gardeners only once a week and weekends off for the driver? No. Absolutely not. We'll find other places to cut.
ALMA: There aren't any other places. And furthermore, they'll be no more shipments from Maxim's either. We can't afford it. She snatches the list out of his hand.
ALMA (CONT'D): The foie gras at Chasen's is more than adequate.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: But those geese are from Barstow not Marseilles.
(CONTINUED): She turns back to him.
ALMA: We all have to make our little sacrifices for the greater good, don't we, Alfred? She leaves Hitch to resume contemplating the contents of the fridge...but there's nothing there to satisfy his growling hunger. He SLAMS the fridge and --
ED GEIN: Stay here. I'm going to get the knives. We pan to REVEAL HITCHCOCK standing in the corner. He looks terrified but completely enthralled -- he can't resist creeping forward for a thorough inspection. Hitch's POV as he steps closer to the tub and glimpses the woman's blood- spattered WHITE BRA and GIRDLE. Suddenly -- FINGERS CLUTCH the rim of the tub.
DEAD WOMAN: Help me. Hitch recoils but she LURCHES UP and GRABS his throat.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Ed! Ed!
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Ed... Ed...?
(CONTINUED): It takes a moment to get his bearings.
ALMA: Oh, shut up. Just get the first take under your belt you'll be fine. But Hitch isn't looking convinced.
PEGGY: I still can't believe you cast Vera Miles as the sister. Hitch sits in his director's chair reading a copy of the London Times.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I've still got her under contract. I may as well get something out of it.
PEGGY: Rather a thankless role, don't you think?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: For an utterly thankless girl. But he still watches VERA over the top of his newspaper as the A.D. leads her through the maze of hazardous cables and light stands towards the fitting room. She passes an actor in a HIGHWAY PATROLMAN'S UNIFORM trying on various sunglasses with the prop master.
PEGGY: Shurlock's office called again. They want to know when you'll be making the changes to the script. Hitch gets up from his chair.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: The more we frustrate them the more their interest will wane. He goes over to specify the correct sunglasses that should be worn. The Cop puts on the MIRRORED shades. Hitch nods his approval.
HITCH: Strains to get a better view.
VERA MILES: Break it to me gently. Am I playing a lesbian librarian?
RITA RIGGS: (re: the fabric) He chose it himself and had it imported from Paris. Vera laughs dryly at a WIG on a dummy head.
VERA MILES: If I wear that, I'm going to look like George Washington.
RITA RIGGS: Wait until you see the undergarments he picked out for you. Vera tosses off her shirt.
VERA MILES: I just have to keep telling myself, one more picture and I'm free as a bird. She unhooks her bra and crosses to hang it on a hook right near the HOLE where we just saw Hitchcock's eye. His eye is gone, only darkness from the other side. Vera feels a chill and instinctively covers her breasts with her arm.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Are you decent my dear? JANET steps out dressed in a crisp, sexy white shirt and pencil skirt. She does a twirl for him. The effect is stunning. Even the stagehands stop to watch.
JANET LEIGH: Am I alright?
(CONTINUED): His picks a tiny piece of lint on her sleeve.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Perfect. As he escorts her onto the soundstage, Tony comes up to greet them.
ANTHONY PERKINS: I want to thank you again for this opportunity, Mr. Hitchcock.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: It's just "Hitch", Tony. Hold the cock. Janet caught that -- she's clearly amused. Tony gives her a gracious peck on the cheek.
JANET LEIGH: And we're about to move to a whole new neighborhood. Already, Tony can't help feel a little excluded from Hitch and Janet's little clique. Hitch ushers them across the soundstage where the crew are assembling.
VERA MILES: Morning Janet. Morning Tony. Vera Miles marches up in her frumpy tweed suit and wig.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: (already moving past her) That's hand-woven imported camel hair from Rodier. Don't you approve?
VERA MILES: You're the genius. She checkmates him with a ravishing smile.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Everyone's is. Until Alma finishes the revisions. Now hurry along, Vera. You're just in time for the oath.
VERA MILES: The what? He steers her towards a line of laughing CREW MEMBERS forming a circle with the rest of the cast. He takes Janet by the hand, placing her right next to him and officiously raises his right hand. The cast and crew duly follow suit, all except for Vera.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I solemnly promise...
CREW: I solemnly promise...
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: (ignoring Vera's sarcasm) That I will not divulge the plot nor the many secrets of Psycho...
CREW: That I will not divulge the plot nor the many secrets of Psycho...
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: To friends, relatives, trade reporters or columnists -- not even to outgoing President Dwight D. Eisenhower, God bless him. Everyone cracks up, but Hitchcock's only interested in the reaction of his new blonde, standing in pride of place, right beside him.
(CONTINUED): She pauses, takes off her glasses and pushes aside her corrections, suddenly fed up with the all the work. She looks out at the swimming pool, sparkling in the sunlight... then turns to the expensive-looking SHOPPING BAG half-open on the side... We hear a LOUD SPLASH --
ANTHONY PERKINS: Now, Hitch, explain to me why I'm watching Marion undress?
JANET LEIGH: I feel like I should take offense at that. She and Tony laugh. Hitch's eyes light up at this display of mischief from her.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I don't know...Perhaps as a boy, Norman secretly watched his mother preparing for her nightly bath.
JANET LEIGH: Maybe there was a transom over the bathroom door?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Yes -- one he could access with a chair so long as he was stealthy.
JANET LEIGH: Well, a boy's first glimpse of a naked woman is usually his mother.
ANTHONY PERKINS: So...I'm reliving the past, repeating a ritual with Marion?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: You're the actor. You figure it out. Tony flinches at Hitch's brusque response. They arrive at the set wall, where Hitch removes a painting to reveal the PEEPHOLE.
JANET LEIGH: Hitch, I have a question. Why is the hole much larger on this side?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: All the better to see you at the greatest possible angle my dear... Janet simply steps up and presses her face to the hole. Hitch studies her profile, quietly thrilled at her curiosity. Tony hangs back, watching Hitch watching her...
JANET LEIGH: Wow. You really do your research, don't you?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: It's just my Jesuit work ethic. He takes a quick peek through the hole now too...then puts the painting carefully back into place over it.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: ... and if I'm not working then I'm nothing. I'm not even a person. I'm just a collection of molecules. A useless cylinder of ugly flesh. The Analyst circles one of his notes on a pad with his Montblanc. Again, we notice how rough-hewn his hands are.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: My mother? Yes. Hitch looks over at the unseen analyst and considers him.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: To her, movie people were akin to thieves and prostitutes. He turns back to look out the window.
(THEN): The Oscar is your mother.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: You're a fine one to talk.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: You will be wearing a white bra like this for the opening scene on the bed. And then after you've stolen the money... They move on to a second row of brassieres - all dark.
JANET LEIGH: I switch to one of these. He nods, correct. She moves over to a mannequin displaying the iconic jet black brassiere.
RITA RIGGS: Are you sure you don't want to look at something a little more elegant?
HITCHCOCK: No. They have to look like they were bought at Sears and Roebuck. I want every woman in the audience to look up at Janet having sex with John Gavin and think, `that could be me'. Janet reads the label. It's "Maidenform."
JANET: This is the brand I wear. Hitch digests the information and turns to Rita.
HITCHCOCK: We're ready for a fitting. As Rita starts to measure Janet's chest, Hitchcock lifts his hands and `frames' her...
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: We go under the blinds and match dissolve into the room itself...
ON HITCH: watching from his directing chair. Peggy stands next to him.
PEGGY: Good luck getting this one past the censor.
WHITFIELD COOK: You girls go on ahead. The PRETTIEST ONE stops to make Whit light her cigarette before catching up with the others.
PEGGY: If you ask me, the credits should read "Screenplay by Joseph Stefano and Alma Reville."
ALMA: The people who matter know. That's all that counts. As she makes a few more changes to the schedule. Alma turns to Peggy whose face tightens as she continues reading. Clearly it's strong stuff.
PEGGY: I'd hate to see Shurlock's face when he reads this. She puts the pages down.
PEGGY (CONT'D): Alma, you always know the answer. Is this really going to work? A candid moment between the two women... but Alma doesn't answer, just leaves.
WHITFIELD COOK: Hello, stranger. She turns to see Whit leaning against the Cadillac.
ALMA: Whit.
WHITFIELD COOK: Where have you been hiding yourself?
ALMA: I've been doing the revisions on... She points to the PSYCHO HOUSE on the ridge.
WHITFIELD COOK: Psycho.
(THEN): And how is the old boy?
ALMA: In a state of unbridled ecstacy now that he's back on the set.
WHITFIELD COOK: And you? How are you?
ALMA: Not bad. I've got eight hundred words to do for Reader's Digest on what it's like to be married to a man obsessed by murder. He looks at her a moment.
WHITFIELD COOK: I've got a better idea. He steps closer.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I'll be right there.
(CONTINUED): But Hitch doesn't move.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Was there a line at the market? Alma looks up, but doesn't turn round, well used to Hitch's cryptic ways.
ALMA: No. Actually, I'm back sooner than I expected. She puts on an apron and gets to work, preparing dinner.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Would you like a cocktail? He heads for the liquor cabinet.
ALMA: No. (he starts to head off) And you shouldn't either. Hitchcock stops. Pulls out a CELERY STICK from one of the bags and bites it.
ALMA (CONT'D): Those haven't been washed yet.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I don't care.
(THEN): I was filming all day with John Gavin -- a good-looking chap but, really, plywood is more expressive. His love scene with Janet may be most horrifying thing in the picture.
(CONTINUED): He takes another BITE, searching her face for some tell-tale sign of guilt.
ALMA: You should tell Whit that. He'd be flattered. She gets to work preparing a salad. Hitch studies the back of her tiny, vulnerable neck, the delicate sinews and muscles as they rise and flex.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Maybe I was too dismissive about your friend Whitfield's book. Perhaps he and Elizabeth could come over this weekend and he can walk me through it. Alma's radar activates but Hitch continues oh-so- nonchalantly.
ALMA: I'll see how my day shapes up. She turns onto her side away from him. Pulls the blankets around her, her eyes still WIDE OPEN.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: ... You think they can't tell... but they can. They know. It's all closing in on you. The noose is tightening... As he continues, we pull back and see:
YOU--: SUDDENLY THE REAR SCREEN film breaks and a frame burns. It's a good thing because Janet is starting to look a little uncomfortable -- was that meant to be funny? As technicians yell and hustle, Hitchcock turns to Peggy --
VERA MILES: Have you talked to him much about your personal life?
JANET LEIGH: Not really...
VERA MILES: I'd keep it that way if I were you. (Off Janet's look) He starts by choosing your hairstyle and clothes and then he wants to choose your friends and decide how many children you should have. Janet finds this a little hard to believe. Vera leans in, lowering her voice.
JANET LEIGH: Compared to Orson Welles, he's a sweetheart. They both turn, sensing something -- and see HITCHCOCK'S DISTINCTIVE SHADOW PROFILE in the hallway. The shadow lingers, then recedes like in a scary ghost story.
VERA MILES: See? He's always watching. They laugh nervously.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: What's the hold up?
PEGGY: It's still engaged. He takes the phone himself just as Vera Miles emerges from her dressing room, script in hand.
VERA MILES: Hitch, I'm stuck on Lila's first scene. I don't know how strongly I should confront Sam and the detective and I --
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Fake it. He turns his back on her and dials. The ENGAGED TONE blares in his ear. His eyes narrow at some crew members fussing with bits of LIGHT and SOUND EQUIPMENT.
(CONTINUED): He rushes off to fix it. Off Peggy's questioning look.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: It's different when their pay is coming out of your own pocket. He raps the receiver button, more intensely this time, and redials.
ALMA: What would I do without you?
WHITFIELD COOK: Till then, bye. She hangs up, toying with her earring, feeling better already when the PHONE rings again very quickly. She picks up without even thinking --
ALMA: What did you forget now?
PR FLACK: Mr. Hitchcock, every press outlet is driving us crazy for photos -- Hitch brushes past him to find another route but more grips are moving a ladder. He turns, kicks a platter of healthy snacks out of the way, only for an ARCLIGHT to swivel in his face and blind him.
PEGGY: Are you okay? You've gone very pale. Peggy's face suddenly comes into focus.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Stop trailing me like a puppy dog and get me something long, cool and wet.
PEGGY: It's not even three.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Give me the key! He snatches it and pushes past her, leaving her flat.
BARNEY BALABAN: Hello, Hitch. How's the picture? I'm hearing interesting things...
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: It's a wonder you can hear anything over the noise coming from the Shurlock office. Balaban offers up his handkerchief. Hitchcock waves it away even though he's now covered in sweat.
BARNEY BALABAN: I shouldn't be in a position of just hearing things, Hitch. It's time you showed me some footage.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Why?
BARNEY BALABAN: To see if you're making a picture Paramount can actually release.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: As you well know, Barney, my contract guarantees me final cut.
BARNEY BALABAN: Your contract also says Paramount isn't required to distribute any film that could cause us embarrassment.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Unlike the last five Martin and Lewis pictures you're all so proud of. He slams the door in Balaban's startled face.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Connect me to Maxim's of Paris. He takes the key and opens the liquor cabinet ignoring the INSISTENT KNOCKING at the door --
(THEN): That's correct. Three. He pours himself five fingers of scotch.
(CONTINUED): Whitfield, in true Hitchcock leading man style, has the perfect amount of wind blowing through his hair.
WHITFIELD COOK: Those steaks haven't changed at all, have they?
ALMA: It's so nice not to have to take care of someone, even if it's just for an hour or two. She takes in the sparkling scenery whipping past.
ALMA (CONT'D): Whit, where are we going? You still haven't told me.
WHITFIELD COOK: I have a little surprise.
ALMA: A surprise. How fun. Whit just smiles as he jams the acceleration and the car ROARS off down the highway.
JANET LEIGH: What happened to your driver?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I've been asking myself the same thing. She smiles.
JANET LEIGH: I can give you a ride if you want. Hitchcock raises an eyebrow at the tiny car, and then, with great effort inches his massive frame through the open door.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Did you know Adolf Hitler sketched the design for this car on Ferdinand Porsche's cocktail napkin in a Berlin beer garden?
JANET LEIGH: I didn't. She turns to see Hitch wedged uncomfortably into his seat.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: It's only now that I truly appreciate just how diabolical Herr Hitler was. She notices him eyeing the half-eaten bag of CANDY CORN on the dashboard (the kind Norman Bates enjoys throughout "Psycho".)
JANET LEIGH: Help yourself. (letting him in on it) I pinched them from Tony's dressing room. He takes one and chews it curiously.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: So this is what they eat at the drive- ins... He takes the whole bag and sets to work, popping them in one after the other.
JANET LEIGH: I thought you only ate Fauchon chocolate.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Needs must when the devil drives, my dear. He's so deadpan but now there's no way to tell if he's joking or not. She puts the car into gear, sensing his despair.
(CONTINUED): nesting in the sand. Alma and Whit sit out watching the surf. The water laps over their toes.
ALMA: I don't mind that he uses his obsession to fuel his art. I just don't like it when he uses it against me.
WHITFIELD COOK: He's like any great artist. Impossible to live with but worth the effort. (he throws a rock into the
SEA): Van Gogh wasn't exactly a walk in the park either.
ALMA: Did you know when we started out I was his boss? He didn't even dare ask me out until he'd worked his way up to assistant director. Whit watches as she picks up some sand, lets it run through her fingers...
WHITFIELD COOK: What do you think of that place over there? He nods to a SMALL BEACH HOUSE up the way.
ALMA: Looks nice. Terrific location. Why?
WHITFIELD COOK: It's mine. She looks at him askance. Is he joking?
ALMA: I just saw Elizabeth. Why on earth didn't she tell me?
WHITFIELD COOK: She doesn't know about it.
(CONTINUED): Janet looks over -- decides to risk it.
JANET LEIGH: So what did happen between you and Vera?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I was going to make her star. But she chose the life of a housewife. He stops chewing. We push in as his features turn reflective.
ON JANET: As she looks across and sees the lonely abandoned little boy just sitting there...
WHITFIELD COOK: I'm just leasing it for the offseason. A place to get away from the wife and kid and write.
ALMA: Very Bohemian.
WHITFIELD COOK: You might find that room interesting. Alma looks. The door is partially open -- she sees the one conspicuously new item of furniture. A double bed.
ALMA: Whit. I hope you haven't got the wrong idea.
(CONTINUED): He gives her a rakish grin, then pushes the door open further to reveal the deck beyond.
WHITFIELD COOK: If you were serious about helping me adapt my book, I thought it would be the perfect hideaway. She lets this sink in, entranced by the incredible view and the crashing surf. Then, she steps out onto the deck and up to one of the typewriters. Gives the key an approving TAP.
(CONTINUED): Alma emerges in her nightgown and stops at his bedside, peering down on him. She's not completely sure that he's actually awake, but she suspects.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: So I read your finished treatment. "Taxi to -- " Where was it?
ALMA: Dubrovnik.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: That's it. Dubrovnik. Care to hear my opinion?
ALMA: Yes. Naturally.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: There's no other way of saying it. It's stillborn. Dead in the water. Alma blinks, unable to hide her shock.
ALMA: How so?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: (with mock compassion) The plot's a muddle. Some of the jokes are awfully like things we already did better hundreds of years ago in The Lady Vanishes. And your villain is weak. But the biggest failure is the relationship between the hero and heroine. He picks up a radish and bites into it.
ALMA: How would you know what really goes on between a man and a woman?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Look at this mess. He grabs the net and starts scooping them out.
(CONTINUED): He can't get the net into the inflow filter so he gets down on his hands and knees and starts PULLING OUT the leaves with his hands.
ALMA: watches from the window... then turns away.
HITCH: Pulls out handful after handful of wet leaves, clawing away at them like a madman...
SET HAND: Tell the boss we're ready.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: What's the hold-up? Call time was two hours ago. Peggy nervously knocks on Janet's door and peers inside --
JANET LEIGH: And you're sure this moleskin will stay put?
RITA RIGGS: Mr. Hitchcock promised.
(CONTINUED): Neither woman looks convinced but they proceed with blind faith.
JANET LEIGH: It better. I'm going to be taking a shower all week. As Janet slips on her robe, a MOLESKIN TRIANGLE PLOPS onto the floor. Rita and Janet share a worried look.
ALMA: Forget what Hitch said. He's just feeling his age. He'll come around.
WHITFIELD COOK: But he's right. It does need more feeling. Alma ponders the problem. Finally --
ALMA: So why don't we put some in? She gets to her feet and starts to pace...
ALMA (CONT'D): All we need is a better catalyst. Some innocuous little trigger to release all that underlying desire. The soothing sound of the ocean gives way to the relentless HISS of SHOWER WATER --
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Good morning. He takes her hand and guides her into position.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Ah. There's our murderess. Into frame steps Anthony Perkins' FEMALE STUNT DOUBLE, MARGO, wearing a gingham dress, silver wig and BLACK MAKEUP TO MASK HER FACE. She wields a large PROP KNIFE and almost blocks our view of Janet in the white-tiled stall.
JANET LEIGH: My mother always said, "Have confidence in yourself and you can lick anything." Hitchcock takes Janet's hand, and with tremendous sincerity :
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: My mother used to say the same thing.
(THEN): Let's go for a take. Quiet everyone. Over and over, Margo attacks with the knife and Janet tries deflecting the blows but both women are timid and Janet is clearly guarding her modesty and covering her body.
(LEAPING UP): Cut. Cut camera.
(CONTINUED): He charges over to Margo to demonstrate the savage stabbing gesture he demands.
CREW MEMBER: Ready, sir. Hitchcock nods. The camera whirs. Hitchcock hoists the knife into the air with terrifyingly convincing power and malevolence.
ON HITCH: As he realizes EVERYONE is staring at him. He straightens his tie, attempting to regain some semblance of control.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Print. We've got it. He exits quickly. Rita escorts the shaken and exhausted Janet off set, passing Vera who's witnessed the whole thing. She's wearing a bathrobe. Janet gives her a look as if to say `Now I understand.'
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Not now, Ed. It's really not a good time. He staggers towards the water cooler, fumbling for a cup. Ed steps forward and pours him some water, pats his shoulder.
ED GEIN: You just can't keep this stuff bottled up. But before Hitch can drink it he crashes to the floor.
PEGGY: Oh God...
(CONTINUED): Peggy rushes forward to help. Perkins just stands and stares, as if paralysed in some Freudian nightmare.
A TELEPHONE: starts to ring.
WHITFIELD COOK: What if Helen and Michael try and get into the cab at the same time?
ALMA: Even better, what if they reached for the cab door at exactly the same time? Alma demonstrates so that their hands touch.
ALMA (CONT'D): That way, we could start close on the hands... (tracking the movement) ... and then tilt up to the eyes. They stare into each other's eyes, lips just inches apart...
WHITFIELD COOK: That feels better already. Finally, the phone intrudes.
ALMA: Are you going to get that? With some effort, Whit goes inside and picks it up.
PEGGY: I know you told me only to call in an emergency, but I'm not sure how else to describe this. Hitch lies slumped on the floor. A compress over his forehead. His head lolls to one side as he slips in and out of consciousness...
MARTIN BALSAM: It's official. The inmates are running the asylum. Peggy hands Hilton the phone.
PEGGY: Hilton. I have Mr. Hitchcock for you. She gives him a warning look. "Watch out. He's in a terrible mood." He waves away her concern. It can't be that bad.
HILTON GREEN: Hey there, Hitch. We're still working on it. (looking over at the
CONTINUING ARGUMENT): Everyone misses you.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I've told Peggy and now I'm going to tell you. You have to get this sequence shot today. What's the hold up?
HILTON GREEN: We tried it ten different ways and it looks terrible. Why don't we use inserts?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: No. It has to be a high angle. You'll tip off the big surprise! Just get the process shot. Hitch slams down the phone.
ON HILTON: Still clutching the phone, a little nonplussed. Peggy gives him a look: "What did I tell you."
ALMA: No more phone calls. You're burning up.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Burning up our money. We're two days behind and I'm stuck in bed. Hitch swings his legs out of the bed.
ALMA: Where do you think you're going?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: To the set. We can't afford to lose any more time. Two more days of this and the whole production goes under. He shakily tries to get to his feet.
ALMA: You stay in bed. I'll deal with it.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I'd hate to take you away from your writing partner.
(CONTINUED): She pushes him back against the pillows. He's too weak to resist.
ALMA: Under the blankets. Now.
ALMA: Don't stop work because of me. I'm only here as one of the two people paying your salaries. Alma takes a seat in Hitch's DIRECTOR'S chair. As her eyes dart around the set, it's clear that she IS TAKING EVERYTHING IN. Peggy flanks her.
ALMA (CONT'D): Scene?
PEGGY: One seventy three.
ALMA: Storyboards? Peggy hands the boards to Alma. She and Hilton quickly review the boards.
ALMA (CONT'D): Start with the overhead. We'll cut before the fall. Then we'll put Martin in a chair under the camera. Hilton looks at Russell. Perfect. He sets ANTHONY PERKINS in his dress into place.
ALMA (CONT'D): (to the cameraman) And that lens should be a thirty-five. Peggy mouths Alma a silent "THANK YOU" for restoring order.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: What do you mean? Gein steps over to the bathroom and pushes open the door.
ED GEIN: My mother always said if you're going to do a job, do it right.
ED GEIN: Check the floor. He looks down but again, nothing.
ALMA: Barney. He sees her and bristles, clearly surprised to see her there.
BARNEY BALABAN: Alma. Alma takes in Balaban's companion, and the viewfinder round his neck.
BARNEY: You know David Kirkpatrick. He's working on Jerry Lewis' next picture. She does. They nod politely -- then stand there.
BARNEY (CONT'D): So he's free to help... (a sly smile) if you need it... Silence. Just the bustle of crew members in the background.
ALMA: That won't be necessary.
BARNEY: But you're nearly three days behind. He takes a step towards Hitch's empty chair, but Alma moves to block his path. It may be a small gesture, but it's highly charged. Barney stares down at her.
BARNEY BALABAN: Alma. We both know what kind of film this is. (then, closer) The smart thing to do would be to help Hitch finish it.
ALMA: Thank you for your concern, Barney. She moves closer to him, holding his gaze, not bending one bit...
ALMA (CONT'D): But on a Hitchcock picture, there is only one director. The anger flashes on his face as she faces him down, the entire crew behind her now, holding firm...
WOMAN'S VOICE: Mrs. Hitchcock? She turns to see Janet walking over in Capri pants and a sleeveless top. She's carrying an elegantly wrapped package.
JANET: I hope you don't mind. I heard Hitch was sick so I got him a little something. She hands Alma the gift. A bag of candy corn tied with a ribbon.
ALMA: That's kind of you.
JANET: Well, he's been very considerate with me.
(A BEAT): I haven't always had that from my directors.
ALMA: Janet, you've been very... professional. It hasn't gone unappreciated.
(CONTINUED): Alma takes in Janet's unaffected natural beauty -- and her sincerity. She can't help but notice the second glances Janet is provoking from passers-by now... She's an impossible rival for any woman.
ALMA: May I turn that down? She silences the stereo. Hitch doesn't react.
ALMA (CONT'D): You'll be pleased to know order has been restored. He still doesn't look at her, masticating loudly.
ALMA (CONT'D): A thank you would be nice.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: We're still two days behind and sixty thousand over budget.
ALMA: I already cancelled the wrap party. That'll save us two thousand right there. And you won't be tempted by any champagne and cake. She pulls at the bowl of ice cream. He refuses to let go.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Beware -- all men are potential murderers. She yanks it from his grip.
ALMA: Alright, what's this about? He slowly pulls the ASPIRIN BOTTLE from his robe pocket, building suspense as he unscrews the lid and pours SAND into a tiny pile on the coffee table in front of him.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Spending a lot of time at the beach? He puts down the bottle, looking for a reaction.
ALMA: That's where Whit and I are writing. He's rented a place.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Hardly the ideal setting to avoid distractions.
ALMA: Actually, it's very conducive to creative collaboration.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I already told you -- that treatment is a waste of time.
ALMA: Didn't everyone say the same thing about "Psycho"? She reaches for the ASPIRIN BOTTLE to throw it away but Hitch grabs it first --
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Are you and Whit having an affair?
ALMA: Don't be absurd. He's working on something new and needs a little help, that's all.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: What a coincidence. I'm working on something new and I could use a little help too.
ALMA: What do you think I've been doing?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Then why are you spending all hours of the day and night with some overage, talentless mamma's boy?
ALMA: Because it's fun. He quivers, livid.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I am under extraordinary pressures on this picture, the least you can do is give me your full support.
ALMA: Full support? We've mortgaged our house. My house. Alma's eyes flash with unaccustomed hurt and fury.
ALMA (CONT'D): Might I remind you that I have weighed-in on every aspect of this film so far, as I have done on every picture you've done in the last three decades. And the first time you show the film, it will be my notes that you want. I celebrate with you if the reviews are good and I cry for you if they are not. I host your parties and put up with those fantasy romances with your leading ladies. And when you're out promoting this film around the world, I will stand beside or, rather, slightly behind you, smiling endlessly for the press even when I'm ready to drop, being gracious to people who look through me as if I were invisible because all they can see is the grand and glorious "Alfred Hitchcock." Hitchcock is stunned and silent.
ALMA (CONT'D): Now, for the first time in years, I dare to work on something that isn't "an Alfred Hitchcock Production" and I'm met with accusation and criticisms. This work I'm doing with Whit gives me pleasure and purpose.
ALMA (CONT'D): And even though that takes absolutely nothing away from you, please consider this a reminder: I am your wife, Alma Reville, not one of the contract blondes you badger and torment with your oh-so- specific direction. She turns and, with great dignity, leaves Hitchcock sitting in the gathering gloom. He's not the only one who can deliver a killer blow.
ON HITCH: with that same lost expression on his face, only now dark shadow and harsh light alternate across his features. A NAKED LIGHT BULB dangles from the ceiling as STAGE HANDS prepare the film's climactic scene in the cellar. Hitch watches as VERA reaches out to touch the shoulder of Mrs. Bates. We zoom in on her as she reacts in silent horror, her HAND flying up to hit the light bulb, throwing crazy shadows all over the set. We push in on Hitchcock's face as the strobing light briefly illuminates the image of -
VERA MILES: Free at last. Rita collects Vera's detested wardrobe to take back to wardrobe.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Well, Vera. You always make it look so easy.
VERA MILES: Oh, it was nothing, Hitch. I just faked it. She gives him a dazzlingly ambiguous Miss America smile.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Why didn't you stay with me? I would have made you as big a star as Grace Kelly. She considers the question and the man asking it, sensing something different about him now. She continues wiping off her make-up.
VERA MILES: Unlike Grace Kelly, I can pick up my dry cleaning. I've got a family, Hitch. A home. That will always mean more to me than all of this.
(THEN): That blonde woman of mystery you're after? She's a fantasy. She doesn't exist. He studies her a moment.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: There was a time when I thought I understood you so completely -- understood women.... Hitch gives a very slight bow, touches her on the shoulder, then leaves. Vera watches him go, struck by his rare show of vulnerability.
ALMA'S CAR: She yanks open the door and gets in. Whit runs half dressed from the house...
WHITFIELD COOK: Alma, I thought you were coming later tonight.
ALMA: I thought you rented this place so we could write.
WHITFIELD COOK: I did. I swear -- this just happened. She struggles to get the key in the ignition. He puts his hand desperately on the car door.
ALMA: Don't worry. I won't tell Elizabeth.
WHITFIELD COOK: I mean to Hitch. Whit smiles feebly.
(CONTINUED): Alma tries to hide what a body blow this is.
ALMA: Oh, I wouldn't worry about that, Whit. She starts the car and drives off. Whit watches, deflated, knowing he's ruined everything, his receding figure swallowed up by flickering white light...
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK: You're going to have to cut all that nudity.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: What nudity? It was suggested.
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK: I definitely saw that knife jabbing her.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: We did no such shot.
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK: I'd stake my reputation on it. I'm recommending you cut the shower scene entirely. Hitchcock is livid but holds his tongue.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I'll go over it frame by frame and set up another screening. But Shurlock is already walking away... Wasserman emerges from the screening room conversing with BALABAN. Hitch searches their expressions for some indication but Balaban strides off without saying a single word to him.
LEW WASSERMAN: Let's just say it was a four-letter review and it wasn't `good'. The harsh reality devastates Hitchcock.
ALMA: Is there anything else we can do?
(CONTINUED): Silence. This time he can't bring himself to look her in the eye.
ACCOUNTANT: We'll just have to wait and see how the movie turns out. Alma gets up and crosses to the window. Stares out at the pool reflecting a leaden sky... and the clumps of dead leaves floating across its surface...
ALMA: Well, it is only a house.
HITCH: pours himself another glass, leaving the dogs lapping happily away as he goes over to the Steinway Grand. There's a bank of silver-framed PHOTOS on top. He pauses to take a proper look at them. His and Alma's life together in movies. Smiling at Premieres with Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. On vacation with Jimmy and Gloria Stewart. At a black tie event with Ingrid Bergman and Gregory Peck. But it's the PHOTOGRAPH tucked away at the back that he wants to see most. A BLACK AND WHITE PUBLICITY STILL taken on the set of The Mountain Eagle in 1926. He picks it up and looks at it: The young Hitchcock in front of the camera, dramatically calling "Action!" on his first film. His eyes don't have to move far to find ALMA, standing just behind him, making notes on her clipboard, the same intense, serious look on her face. They look so young... Hitch turns to look out the window, thoughtful -- Hitch's POV. It's SNOWING outside.
(CONTINUED): We find Gein sitting at his workbench. Hitchcock is perched on a stool nearby watching him. Trash and newspapers are piled everywhere. There is grime and dark stains on the cabinets and counters.
ED GEIN: This is my favorite place. I just shut the doors and leave the world behind. Hitch watches Gein as he threads a needle, stitching something expertly together. He notices there's no hint of a tremble in Gein's hands.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Don't you get lonely out here sometimes?
ED GEIN: I can always talk to my mother.
ED GEIN: They can't go in there. That's my mother's room...
(CONTINUED): CAR HEADLIGHTS blast through the window and Hitchcock finally sees the basement room properly for the first time; KNIVES of all shapes and sizes...JARS OF PRESERVED BODY PARTS...and TWO
(CALLING OUT): That's my mother's room!! Ed springs to his feet, screaming it out as he BOLTS UPSTAIRS and the pandemonium continues (o.s.)
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: An odd little movie. Of course, Colbert is wonderful. Alma nods. They watch for a beat longer.
ALMA: Cold and miserable.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Just like Barney Balaban's face. He indicates the over-ripe dialogue coming from the TV.
(PAUSE): And neither am I. Alma takes in his reflective expression, but says nothing.
(THEN): There's no other way to say it... It's stillborn. ALMA turns away. Hitch sits there bereft in the lonely silence.
ALMA: I don't think I can stand both of us being maudlin. She fixes several crackers, each with an appropriate dollop of caviar on top, and puts the plate in the middle.
ALMA (CONT'D): There is one solution to all this, you know. She offers him one of the crackers.
ALMA (CONT'D): We could both get to work -- together. Tentatively, Hitch accepts it.
ALMA (CONT'D): That tiresome little Hitchcock imitation I've been helping Whit finish is done. Hitch remains quiet, delicately consuming his cracker.
ALMA (CONT'D): So I suggest, for everyone's sake, we start whipping Psycho into shape tomorrow. You may not be the easiest man to live with but you know how to cut a picture better than anyone. Hitch puts the lid back on the caviar.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Except for you.
ALMA: You'll need to cut those six or seven frames where she blinks after she's supposed to be dead.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: We've seen the footage a thousand times. She doesn't blink. Alma gives him a look ...
ALMA: Take thirty frames off the head...
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: No, no, the second take, the light is better on his hands.
ALMA: Only cut back to Janet once the car's already moving.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Cut it tighter. The minute I lose one person I've lost the whole audience. TWO PAIRS OF HANDS. Hitchcock's and Alma's. They work like a pair of twenty-year-olds at a pair of MOVIOLAS cutting the picture. ANGLE LOOSENS -- to reveal George Tomasini has dozed off, exhausted.
ALMA: You imp. You got nudity in there.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Her breasts are very large, dear. It was a challenge not to show them.
GEORGE TOMASINI: I'll be damned. She did blink.
FLACK: How's it going in there with Mr. Herrmann?
PEGGY: Swimmingly.
FLACK: Everyone's saying it's a dog with fleas. Before Peggy can deny it the argument flares through the wall.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: ...I don't want music in the shower murder.
BERNARD HERRMANN: But what Alma and I talked about is really going to play.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: No. This isn't Vertigo, Bernie. This is different. The images have to work on their own.
ALMA: You can't scare people just by going, "Boo!" You have to tell them what's coming, make them anticipate it --
OUTSIDE: The PR Flack shares a despairing look with Peggy.
FLACK: Thank God we've got Cinderfella for the holidays.
OMITTED: BERNARD HERRMANN'S ICONIC SCORE RISES as
GEORGE TOMASINI: What do you think?
PEGGY: I think I'm never going to take a shower again.
GEORGE TOMASINI: Hitch? They look at him...
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: It's getting there. Alma turns to him and Hitch nods slightly. Was that the tiniest acknowledgement that her instinct may have been right?
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK: I told you, I distinctly saw both the stabbing and the nudity. We're denying your seal, Mr. Hitchcock.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I take your opinion very seriously. But what you think you're seeing is purely informed by the power of suggestion. I assure you that once you view the final version with Mr. Herrmann's lovely, lyrical score...
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK: A "lyrical score" won't change my opinion. All that innuendo and half-naked groping -- really, Hitch.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Would you mind if we had a word in private, Geoffrey? Shurlock gestures his staff out. Hitch moves closer.
GEOFFREY SHURLOCK: My specifications?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: If only audiences could fully appreciate how tirelessly you work to help us entertain them while protecting them from filth and indecency. Shurlock studies Hitchcock's sphinx-like expression.
PEGGY: He's been harassing you since you announced this project, you invite him to the set, and he doesn't even show up? What did you tell him?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: That I respected him. Deeply. Peggy laughs. Now she understands.
JANET LEIGH: I thought we were reshooting the scene.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: No need. The charade is over. Hitch holds out his arm for her and walks her back to the dressing room.
JANET LEIGH: Not at all. He offers his hand and she shakes it, determined to be professional to the end.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Worthy of a Purple Heart, my dear. She leans in and gives him a peck on the cheek. A moment of unexpected heaven that leaves Hitch speechless.
(CONTINUED): She walks away to her dressing room. Hitch watches as she steps inside and closes the door. After a moment we hear a PIERCING SCREAM --
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I hope you don't mind, I told Mrs. Bates she could have your dressing room.
ON JANET: She can't believe she's been caught out. She closes the door on everyone... and then after a moment SCREAMS AGAIN... but this time not out of shock.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: We have our seal from Shurlock's office.
(DEVILISHLY): Now, we lead the lambs to the slaughter. Hitch turns to Lew for the latest news.
LEW WASSERMAN: The front office confirmed. They're only opening the movie in two theatres, as we suspected. And no premiere. If we don't get word of mouth we're dead.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Then we'd better get started. Peggy, take a memo... Peggy whips out her steno pad.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: ... a fire escape or through a skylight, you will be ejected by brute force. Hitch lays down the track into a large microphone while Alma watches from the recording desk.
ALMA: More playful, darling.
BARNEY BALABAN: "Absolutely never, ever will I allow anything to follow Psycho -- no previews of coming attractions, no newsreel, no short subject and certainly no double- feature. Sincerely, and, emphatically, Alfred Hitchcock." Balaban shuts the pamphlet. Silence. Then turns to the stone- faced board members :
ALMA: Well, at least there are some people here. But Hitch's nerves are hardly soothed. The people in line start to notice the Hitchcocks...is it really them?
PEGGY: Comes over to greet them with the THEATRE MANAGER.
PEGGY: We can go through the side entrance. As the theatre manager ushers them through the side alley --
THEATER MANAGER: Right this way, Mr. and Mrs. Hitchcock. Hitchcock turns to Alma.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Ready for the gallows?
LEW WASSERMAN: We've roped off some seats for you.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: You go on ahead.
ALMA: Are you sure?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I'll join you in a minute. Off Alma's look.
ALMA: Fine, darling. I'll save you a seat. Lew escorts Alma and Peggy into the auditorium.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: (under his breath) But they're laughing too much. He peers down through the tiny window but can't see a bloody thing.
HITCH: as he closes the door and leans back against the wall of the empty corridor. A scared, lonely, corpulent figure. Totally powerless. There's nothing for him to do but wait. And wait. And wait. Across the foyer, a spotty young THEATRE EMPLOYEE sweeps up ticket stubs and empties ashtrays, quietly going about his business, entirely oblivious...
HITCH: As he gestures with his hands, a conductor leading his orchestra, raising them up again as the audience STARTS SCREAMING AGAIN right on cue
(CONTINUED): Lew can be seen on the phone in the theatre manager's office in the background as Hitch, Alma and Peggy walk past the line of ticket buyers to get to the front doors. There is great excitement now as more and more people recognize the Hitchcocks...
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: I promised Mother I wouldn't tell. He gets a laugh. Hitchcock walks alongside the Theater Manager who's not going to miss out on having his own moment with the crowd.
THEATER MANAGER: Mr. Hitchcock, what do I do now that my wife won't take a shower after seeing your movie?
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Have her dry-cleaned. Laughter as Lew appears.
LEW WASSERMAN: I just got off the phone with Balaban. I couldn't resist telling him we're sold out for the next two weeks.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: What did he say?
LEW WASSERMAN: He said "Tell Hitch congratulations. A well deserved triumph as we always knew."
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: "As we always knew..." The two friends a look.
PEGGY: Does this mean I can take the weekend off now? Hitch playfully shrugs, "we'll see".
THEATRE MANAGER: I'm sorry, Mr. Hithcock but there are photographers outside. They heard you were here.
(CONTINUED): The theatre manager ushers them towards the exit doors.
ALMA: This could be the biggest hit of your career, Alfred.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: Our career, Alma. He looks into her eyes with nothing but deep, intense gratitude and joy. As more flashbulbs pop --
ALMA: You do realize I've been waiting decades to hear you say that. He gives her a gentle peck.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: And that, madame, is why they call me "The Master of Suspense"... He helps her into the car.
(CONTINUED): is at a table with two other patients, including a soft spoken older man, CHET. Ed is heavier, his hair is whiter, and he is much more at ease than we've ever seen.
ORDERLY: (to the Attendant) Guess what I'm doing this weekend?
ATTENDANT: What?
ORDERLY: Claudine and I are driving to Chicago with her folks to see that Psycho movie. The Attendant pulls the orderly aside, and whispers to him, nodding toward Ed. The Orderly's jaw drops! It is the coolest thing he's ever heard. He looks at Ed like he's a movie star. Meanwhile, Ed yawns, content. Utterly oblivious.
CHET: I think you're the happiest guy I've ever known, Ed. How you do it?
ED GEIN: I'll tell you. You live your life, and it's unbearable sometimes but there's this secret, Chet; a big secret no one else knows or wants to tell... (he leans a little closer) ... there is a God and he's so big and powerful, he doesn't always remember you're there... He takes a huge bite blueberry pie.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: And so, gentle viewer, Psycho -- the picture everyone predicted would bring me to wrack and ruin -- was such a hit that Alma and I got to... Well, let's just say that we got to keep our house -- and the swimming pool. And the same critics who despised it went on to call it one of my greatest achievements. He produces a CIGAR and wanders towards the exit doors.
ALFRED HITCHCOCK: But you know what they say in Hollywood: "You're only as good as your last picture." So, now, if you'll excuse me, I must toddle off to begin the exhaustive search for my next project. He holds out his cigar towards something we don't yet see...
