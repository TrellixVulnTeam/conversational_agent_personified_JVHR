WERNER (V.O.): On his 35th birthday, I decided to tell Julius Benedict the truth about himself...
WERNER (V.O.): It wasn't that he was the product of a scientific experiment.
WERNER (V.O.): An experiment designed to produce a physically, mentally and spiritually superior human being. I explained that to him when he was two years old.
WERNER (V.O.): And it wasn't the complexity of Julius's parentage. He knew that unlike other little boys, he didn't have just one, but half a dozen fathers, all very distinguished men.                                   *
WERNER (V.O.): Nor was it about the extraordinary woman chosen to be his mother...
WERNER (V.O.): Julius had long lived with the tragic news that she died giving birth to him.
WERNER (V.O.): His mother gave birth to another baby...
JULIUS: (stunned) I have a brother?!!!
WERNER: (speaks with an Austrian accent) He was sent to an orphanage in Los Angeles. At the same time I brought you here to the island.
JULIUS: (amazed) I have a twin brother?!! (for a moment, chews on his right thumbnail) What's his name?
WERNER: Vincent.
JULIUS: (moved) Vincent -- Every time I loved something I called it Vincent -- I called my first computer Vincent! (suddenly spins; starts off) I have to find him!
WERNER: (fretting terribly) You've been here since you were a baby -- you know nothing of America --
JULIUS: I know it is the cradle   of democracy and the land   of the free; besides, I speak   twelve languages -- I'm sure I   can get a job.
JULIUS: My brother will look after me.
JULIUS: It's your only copy --
WERNER: -- My need for it is only sentimental -- yours may be practical --
JULIUS: Thank you -- I'll miss you.
WERNER: (holding back the tears) I'll miss you.
JULIUS: (in Japanese; subtitled) It was an honor to study under you, Master.
ORIENTAL: (in English) Ahhh, always on guard. You have learned well, Julius-san.
JULIUS: (to Werner) I was just thinking, maybe my brother Vincent is married.
JULIUS: Well, if a woman loved my brother enough to marry him, she might have a sister who'd feel the same way about me. That often  happens with twins, you know.
WERNER: Julius -- please -- don't get your hopes up. Your brother doesn't even know you exist.
JULIUS: (loudly as he disappears in the horizon) Of course he does. I've always known there was something missing in my life! And deep down, I'm sure Vincent feels the same way! He's probably just like meeeee!
VINCE: You sleep well, honey?
CARLA (SEXY YOUNG WOMAN): Mmmm... like a baby.
VINCE: Me, too. I love this new mattress. It's soft but it's hard at the same time. And I love this new clock.
CARLA: You really think so?   Even the curtains?
VINCE: The curtains are the key to the whole thing. They're colorful... they're brilliant... they're... great curtains.
CARLA: (melting) You were great last night, Vince.
VINCE: (not disagreeing) Naaaw... (putting his arm around her) I think we're going to be very happy here.
VINCE: (a bit surprised but not panicked) What's he doing back so early?
MAN (O.S.): Carla? You gonna cook me some breakfast or what?
CARLA: Be right down, sweetheart!
CARLA: Hurry up!   I gotta make breakfast!
VINCE: You're wonderful, Carla. Your husband doesn't deserve to kiss your feet.
VINCE: (he's got a good voice) 'Oh what a beautiful morning, Oh what a beautiful day'...
VINCE: (exiting the car, still singing) ... 'everything's going my way'...
VINCE: Carla, what a joy to look at you.
VINCE: (coy) For me?
AL: Carla and I figured, since you were always admiring mine, what the hell...
VINCE: A lighter, just like yours.   I don't know what to say, Al.   I'm all choked up.
CARLA: (into phone) Hello -- the Greco residence... sure. Who may I say is calling... Mr. Burt Klane? Vince, it's for you --
VINCE: (into phone) Good morning, Mr. Klane. I hope you're having a wonderful -- (cut off) Yes -- no problem -- I have it. Yes. Today. Of course. 'Bye.
AL: What are you doing talking to a loanshark?
VINCE: (excited) That's part of my good news -- You know that money I picked up from the Jaguar we boosted. Well,                      * I put the money in the stock                           * market. I got this incredible                          * tip.                                                   *
VINCE: I can't lose. Ever hear of P.V.T.                         * Industries? Probably not --                               * Secret takeover bid --
VINCE: A very special stock -- and it was such a sure thing -- I borrowed another 20 grand from the Klane                      * Brothers.
CARLA: (unbelieving) You borrowed from a loan shark to invest in the stock market?
VINCE: On margin -- And as of last night I was ten thousand ahead. I'm                        * going to make a fortune -- turn on the T.V.
NEWSCASTER (V.O.): ... that Wall Street's suffering its worst single-day's losses since October '87. Hardest hit                       * were Federated Broadcasting, down $18, Waverton Data, down $24 and P.V.T. Industries, down $32. Analysts speculate that even blue chip stocks will not remain immune to...
AL: You are having one shitty birthday, Vince.
AL: Well... '88 B.M.W. came in for long term last night...
CARLA: Don't you think you're doing this too often?
VINCE: I'm a desperate man.                                    *
AL: Level three.   Stall 25.
OWNER: We're in a recession -- Everything's tough -- you want to try someone else -- no hard feelings.
VINCE: (sourly) Forget it.
OWNER: You okay, Vince? You seem a little worried.
VINCE: Me? I laugh myself to sleep every night, and I never sleep alone. I'm doing great!
JULIUS (V.O.): (singing) 'Put on your red dress, baby 'Cause we're going out tonight...'
JULIUS: (singing) 'I better wear some boxing gloves, In case some fool might want to fight.'
STEWARDESS: I knew you were trouble the second I laid eyes on you.
JULIUS: (realizing) Sorry -- I've never heard this music before -- I love it.                             *
STEWARDESS: The captain wants us to buckle our seat belts because we're expecting a little turbulence.
JULIUS: (reading her name tag) Thank you, Betty Lou.
JULIUS: Actually, I'm a horticultural botanist, a mathematician, and a philosopher.
STEWARDESS: Right.    And I'm a brain surgeon.
HIJACKER (MAN): (to passengers) Nobody   moves, or else we're gonna have a   serious draft in here. (turns to another stewardess) Get the   captain. I want to discuss   our final destination.
JULIUS: (whispers) Excuse me, ma'am.
JULIUS: (gently; calming her) His mischief shall return upon his own hand, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own head -- Psalm 7:16.
BARTENDER: It's him.    He's back.
VINCE: Marnie! How are you?        Is your                       * sister around?                                            *
MARNIE: You total Linda's car. You pawn                           * her stereo. You declare us as                             * dependents on your tax return!?
VINCE: What an amazing memory --
FEMALE (O.S.): Vince!   I knew you'd come back!
VINCE: (to Linda) I am so sorry for all the miserable things I've done to you.
LINDA: Like what?
MARNIE: Linda!
VINCE: (emotionally) I didn't come here for a loan, sweetheart. I came to say goodbye. (beat)                                       * It's not safe for me here. People are trying to kill me.
LINDA: What did you do, Vince?
VINCE: I got involved in the stock market.
LINDA: (getting nervous) I promised Marnie I wouldn't give you money.
LINDA: Don't look at me like that... Don't do that with your eyes... I shouldn't even be here with you.
VINCE: (softly) You are here and so am I, Maybe millions of people go by, But they all disappear from view, And I only have eyes for you... Linda. I only have eyes for you.
LINDA: (moved) That is so beautiful. How do you make up that stuff? You're such a poet.
VINCE: (whispers) It's the baby Klane -- I gotta get the hell out.
BURT KLANE: Where's the little shit?
LINDA: (very nervous) You gotta be more specific, considering our clientele.
BURT KLANE: Benedict.
LINDA: (laughs) He wouldn't show his face around here. Right, Marnie?
MARNIE: (enjoying calling him names) Who, Vincent?                                           *
BURT KLANE: (cutting her off) Okay -- enough.
BOB KLANE: Look what I found crawling around out back.
BURT KLANE: This is only four thousand --
VINCE: The rest is invested.     We're gonna make a fortune.
BOB KLANE: (ominous) Shut up.
LINDA: I hope this helps -- Please don't hurt him.
BURT KLANE: There you go -- (he counts Linda's money) -- Another thousand -- Okay -- This nice lady just bought you a day Vince -- I want it all -- Twenty- thousand -- this time tomorrow.                        *
VINCE: Twenty -- ?   But I just paid --
BURT KLANE: That's just the interest.    The                       * twenty's the principal.                                *
VINCE: That was the most wonderful birthday present anybody ever gave me --
LINDA: It's your birthday?   Why didn't you tell me?
VINCE: (suddenly honest) I can't take the kindness.    It gives me the shakes.
LINDA: You'll tremble plenty before we're through, Vince Benedict.
JULIUS: (almost a whisper) ... How wonderful...
JULIUS: (to himself) What an amazing country.
BIKER #1: Got a light, pal?
JULIUS: Sorry, but I don't smoke... pal?
BIKER #1: (indicating "Fredericks") Looking for something for your girl friend?
JULIUS: I... don't have a girl friend. Do women really wear these things?
BIKER #1: If you're lucky. (a beat) You from out of town?                                     *
BIKER #1: (to Julius) What the hell did you do?
JULIUS: I did nothing, the pavement was his enemy.
JULIUS: I would say -- a concussion -- a mild shoulder separation, and ribs
JULIUS: Get him to a hospital.
VINCE: Fifty-three dollars?   You gotta                         * be kidding.
COP: Your vehicle's in a handicapped zone.
VINCE: So?    Do I look normal to you?
COP: You don't have a 'handicapped' sticker on your windshield. (a beat) Driver's license, please.
COP: You've got over 200 outstanding parking tickets, Mr. Benedict. And you just had your birthday? Well, your driver's license just expired -- Happy birthday.                               *
JULIUS (V.O.): So, this is where my brother grew up. I'm glad he had so many friends to play with.                                     *
JULIUS: And that's where he must have slept.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: How did you know?
JULIUS: It's the one I would have chosen. It's next to the fire extinguisher. In case of a fire, I could have given the alarm, and saved the other orphans.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: We've only had one fire at St. Charlotte's. Vince Benedict started it, we like to think by accident.
JULIUS: Tell me about him. Was he a good athlete? Did he like chess and poetry?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: That's odd... the contents of his file are missing.
JULIUS: This is him?   He looks happy --                        *
MOTHER SUPERIOR: (sighing) He should -- that's Sister Maria,                       * his biology teacher.
JULIUS: I always liked biology.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: So did Vincent. He disgraced Sister Maria, who had to leave the order. Then he stole all the money from our library fund and ran away.
JULIUS: But I have to find him.   Where do you think he might be?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Jail. A man of his character could only be in jail. You're full of goodness, Julius -- I pray that you never find him.
SEVEN FOOTER: (to Vince who is scowling at him) What're you lookin' at?
VINCE: At you, you jerk.
VINCE: (to the others in the cell) Tyrone Davis, averaged 23 points, eleven rebounds and four blocks a game his senior year. First round pick of the L.A. Clippers and now look at him.
SEVEN FOOTER: (stunned by the amount of information) Who're you?
VINCE: (as he gives Tyrone a card) World International Athletics                           * Representation. Vincent Benedict -- President. I coulda got you a no-cut contract so you wouldn't have to heist T.V. sets for a living --
GUARD: Benedict!    Visitor.
GUARD: (pointing to Vince) You got 'im.
JULIUS: (impassioned, but a bit rambling; his emotions are in control) Vincent... dearest Vincent... I have rowed halfway across the world -- no, wrong, I only rowed one day but I came halfway across                     * the world -- I know you don't know who I am, but believe me when I say I have been waiting for this                      * moment all my life...
VINCE: You gotta talk into the phone,                        * asshole.
JULIUS: (understands now -- into the phone) Vincent...
JULIUS (V.O.): ... Dearest Vincent...
JULIUS (V.O.): I know you don't know who I am, but -- I came halfway across the world --
VINCE: (cutting in) -- Whoa. I still got another six hours to pay the money back. You                         * tell those crummy Klane brothers that harassing a man when he's already in the slammer is beneath even them --
JULIUS: (overlapping -- they do this a lot) -- I don't know any Klane brothers. I'm your brother, Julius.
VINCE: (stopped dead) Huh?    Again?
JULIUS: I don't know any Klane Brothers.
VINCE: (wary) Yeah.   Go on -- I got that part.
JULIUS: My name is Julius -- I'm your twin brother.
VINCE: (laughing) Obviously -- the minute I sat down I felt like I was looking in a mirror.
JULIUS: We're not identical twins.
VINCE: I wouldn't be too sure.
VINCE: -- That's right. I don't believe a word you said.                                        *
JULIUS: Vincent, I don't lie. I am your brother. Let me help you get out                        * of here.
VINCE: (now he's interested) Oh... you want to help me get outta here?
JULIUS: Yes.
VINCE: Well, money talks, bullshit walks.
JULIUS: How can bullshit walk?   Is that slang?
VINCE: (to himself) I'm in fast company here -- (to Julius) Listen, you get me outta here, I'll be whatever you want, best friend, brother, nephew, niece, grandma...
VINCE: (to himself as he leaves) Just don't ask me to bend over --
JULIUS: I have some more money --
VINCE: You do?
JULIUS: I am happy to help you, Vincent. You're my brother. I love you.
VINCE: Julius -- look -- ease up on the love talk or I'm gonna be tossing my cookies, all right?
JULIUS: Tossing cookies, that is more slang?
VINCE: Just gimme your wallet, okay?
VINCE: No, you don't.
JULIUS: You're thinking that this whole twin business is what you call 'bullshit.'
VINCE: Actually, I was thinking I'm going to need some more money -- to put gas in my car --
JULIUS: You can take some more money --
VINCE: I can?
JULIUS: Sure...
VINCE: We're brothers -- right?
VINCE: They arrest you, they put you                             * behind bars, they fine you and                            * then they hide your car.                                  *
JULIUS: That's -- (points) -- your car, isn't it?
VINCE: Yeah --   How'd you know that was my car.
JULIUS: We're twins!
JULIUS: (very happy) I'm so excited -- we'll go to museums together, discuss philosophy together, read books together -- play chess together --
VINCE: -- Get lost together --
AL: You guys must be going to Hawaii, huh? Catch that good surf.
GARFIELD: Something like that.
AL: There's plenty of space on level four.
MOVER: Taking back the furniture -- you're six months behind.
MISS BUSBY: I tried to stop them, Mr. Benedict --
VINCE: It was time to redecorate anyway.
MISS BUSBY: (into phone) Vincent Benedict, Incorporated -- Sports agent, artist's representative -- import/export -- automobile sales, rentals, and leasing -- wholesale patio furniture -- How may I help you? (listens briefly) Oh, hi. (to Vince) It's Al.
VINCE: (taking it, talking to her, sweetly) Miss Busby -- Stacy -- this is a transition period for the corporation -- Why don't you take a few days off.
MISS BUSBY: (a little lost) ... Aah -- all right. Whatever you say, Mr. Benedict...
VINCE: I hope you got some good news,                         * Al --                                                  *
AL: (into phone) Brand new Caddy on level four.
MORRIS KLANE: Time's up, Vincent -- Got the money?
VINCE: (gasping) Did you hit me yet? 'Cause I didn't feel nothin'.
MORRIS KLANE: You gotta understand something, Benedict -- I like my work.
JULIUS: (quietly) These are most unfriendly acts you are committing.
MORRIS KLANE: (totally surprised) What?
MORRIS KLANE: (absolutely in agreement) Okay, okay.
JULIUS: Good.                                                 *
JULIUS: You moved too soon.
JULIUS: An important rule in a crisis                         * situation -- negotiate first, attack last. You never negotiated. You don't know what kind of enemy I am.
MORRIS KLANE: Who are you?
JULIUS: Vincent's brother.
VINCE: (happily) We're twins.
MORRIS KLANE: You're firewood.
JULIUS: -- And I have no respect for those with no respect for logic. You're a very stupid person.
VINCE: Tell your brother 'He messes with me, he messes with my whole family!'
VINCE: (happy) I like it when you hit people!
JULIUS: I hate violence.
VINCE: But you're so good at it. We ought to go into business together. You could be a boxer and I'll be your manager.
JULIUS: I don't think I could fight for money.
VINCE: No problem. You do the fighting, I'll keep all the money.
JULIUS: (laughing) I'm worried about you, Vincent.
JULIUS: How much money do you owe? Don't lie -- we're twins, I can feel your pain.
VINCE: (exploding) Why do you keep saying that? We're not twins, we're not brothers, we're nothing, and you're only in this car because I could use a little protection these days --
VINCE: (a beat; then, quietly) Due this morning.
VINCE: I don't know where my head is -- I forgot I promised this friend of mine -- Sammy -- I'd pick up his car at the airport -- do me a big favor, okay? Drive this car back from the airport for me.
JULIUS: I'd love to.
VINCE: What are you doing with that finger?
JULIUS: Learning to drive.
JULIUS: What's the matter?
VINCE: That dopey Sam -- He did it again. Forgot to leave the keys... A lot of handicapped kids are gonna be really disappointed...
JULIUS: (moved) Handicapped children?
JULIUS: Maybe we should try to open it ourselves...
VINCE: You think we should do a thing like that?
JULIUS: Of course -- it's for the children...
VINCE: (feigning ignorance) I saw a guy from the auto club do this once...
VINCE: Whaddya know?    Beginner's luck!
JULIUS: When the back end is raised to an angle greater than 45 degrees, a mercury switch activates the automatic cutoff system. The alarm's computer thinks the car is being towed away and shuts off.
VINCE: No shit...
JULIUS: (into phone) Vincent Benedict's car. (a beat) Vincent! Where are you?
JULIUS: (waving into mirror) Hi, Vincent.
VINCE (V.O.): There's a supermarket up ahead. Take your foot off the gas and very -- very -- very gently put it on the brake.
JULIUS: The brake -- right.
JULIUS: The brakes worked just fine!
VINCE: Lemme tell you something about America, Julius -- nobody likes a smart-ass.
MARNIE: The answer's obvious.
LINDA: There's only one Vince Benedict. He's a force of nature.
LINDA: I know that -- Geez, you don't think I know that -- ? (soft) It's so cute, the way he thinks he's tricking me. Anyway, what's wrong about other people's songs? Some guys tell you dirty jokes. It just proves that Vince has a romantic soul.
MARNIE (O.S.): Excuse me.
MARNIE: (looking at the centerfold) She's not bad...
JULIUS: (embarrassed) I'm sorry. I had no idea these magazines had things like that... inside them.
JULIUS: As a matter of fact, a small tropical island, in the South Pacific, about 300 nautical miles south-southwest of Fiji. I only got here yesterday, but already                        * I've found my wonderful brother.                       *
VINCE (O.S.): That's right...
JULIUS: (proudly) My twin brother, Vincent.
VINCE: (to Linda) God you look beautiful in this light.
LINDA: Vince... ?   I didn't know you had a brother.
JULIUS: You all know each other?
VINCE: Julius, meet Linda and... (sarcastic) Her charming sister, Marnie.
JULIUS: (significant) Sisters?
MARNIE: (to Julius) Twins?
VINCE: (waving) Goodbye girls, see you soon.
JULIUS: (waving) Goodbye girls, see you soon.
JULIUS: (embarrassed) I've only been drivng for an hour.
MARNIE: Why do I think I'm going to see him again? (beat) Like maybe tomorrow.
JULIUS: Linda is your girl friend, isn't she?
VINCE: Yeah.   Kind of.
JULIUS: Is Marnie your girl friend, too?
VINCE: Marnie! Marnie hates my guts. She seemed to like you.
JULIUS: (trying not to sound too interested) She hardly knows me.
VINCE: That's the best way --   women love men who are mysterious   and devious. It keeps them on their   toes -- makes them excited you   know what I mean?
JULIUS: No.
VINCE: You do like women, don't you?
VINCE: Now correct me if I'm wrong. You're a virgin, aren't you?
JULIUS: That's private.
VINCE: (to himself) He's a 230-pound virgin.                              *
VINCE: (to cat) Alright! Alright! I got your food. Yes! 'Liver and Cheese,' 'Chicken Giblets,' all your favorites, Julius.
JULIUS: You named your cat, Julius?
VINCE: The secret to take-out veal Parmesan is adding a little extra cheese. I know you're probably used to growing your own vegetables and spearing fish in the lagoon, but here on the mainland we just nuke it!
VINCE: Dinner is served!
VINCE: (expansive) So, let me get this right. One of                    * our fathers was a famous football player, another one was a physicist at M.I.T. --
JULIUS: He won the Nobel Prize.
JULIUS: I think it's important we try to find our fathers.
VINCE: You mean, all those geniuses who contributed to the... (making a jerk-off gesture) ... Sperm milkshake?                                   *
JULIUS: Why are you being so immature about this?                                            *
VINCE: Do you know how many times I've heard stories like this? It's every orphan's fantasy: 'My real Mom and Dad were rich and beautiful, but there was a mix-up at the hospital and I got switched with another baby... But one day there's going to be a knock at the door and there they'll be with open arms, crying... "My darling! My treasure! We didn't know! How can we make it up to you?"' (a beat) I'm telling you this for your own good, Julius. It's a crock.
JULIUS: Dear Sister Anderson, your request for orphans benefits for Vincent Benedict has been denied. According to our files his mother did not die during birth. We have a current address for her at 172 Canyon Glen Drive, Los Angeles. Vincent's case seems to be one of simple abandonment and as such he is inelligible for aid.
VINCE: That's right, Julius, she abandoned me.
JULIUS: This letter was written thirty                      * years ago. We were five years old                   * -- Our mother... didn't die when we were born... (staring at Vince now) You've known all this time where she was and you never contacted her?
VINCE: (angry) I don't know about your momma, Miss Perfect of 1952, but my momma was a slut, and if she's still alive, I hope she's in a lot of pain. She dumped me once -- no way she gonna get a chance to do it again --
JULIUS: Vincent, if they lied to us about Momma for all these years, maybe they lied to her, too. We must find her, we must check this address.                                            *
VINCE: Julius -- slow down -- I've got no time for this. You go hunt down                       * Mom, I've got a cash flow problem                     * to deal with.
VINCE: (into phone) What!
BURT KLANE (V.O.): We haven't forgotten about you, Benedict -- You better have our money tomorrow morning. Or else.
VINCE: Or else what?
JULIUS: Everyone seems so angry in America.
GARFIELD: The tests on the lower temperature gaskets look great.
LARSON: Looks like an easy weekend.
GARFIELD: (preoccupied) Not now.
GARFIELD: Who are you?
WEBSTER: (friendly) I'm Webster, it's okay.
LARSON: (terribly upset) Christ, man, you were never                            * supposed to come here.
GARFIELD: (rattled) The deal was we were never supposed to meet. You're supposed to be...
WEBSTER: Driving that Cadillac to Texas? (holds up his gloved hands) Got my driving gloves, got my driving glasses, got my hat... but no car.
GARFIELD                                 *: The car was there! The merchandise was in the trunk! Your instructions were on the cassette!
WEBSTER: Let me explain something to you. I have a reputation to uphold. People put their trust in me because they know I always deliver the goods and I always come back with the money. This whole thing is making me look very bad... professionally.
GARFIELD: This is bullshit! The car was there.
LARSEN: That's right. The parking attendant thought we were off for Hawaii.
WEBSTER: (a brief pause) The parking attendant?
GARFIELD: He liked the car. We'd put on those damn loud shirts so we'd look like tourists --
LARSEN: He asked us if we were going surfing. He was a jerk.
WEBSTER: You know, I just realized that in                     * twenty years of service no other                      * client has ever seen my face.
GARFIELD: (nervously)                                    * I don't think that's a problem.
WEBSTER: Thanks for everything, guys. I'll see what I can do about those Laker tickets. (a beat) Yeah, I'll tell her.
WEBSTER: They want you to hold their calls. They're going to be working late.
JULIUS: I'm terribly sorry to disturb your party and I realize this might sound strange, but I'm looking for someone who lived here a long time ago... (finally) Mary Anne Benedict.
JULIUS: She was my mother.
GRANGER: You're Mary Anne's son?
GIRL: (pointing at photo) Isn't that you, Grandpa?
GRANGER: (to Girl) Why don't you go help your grandma with lunch, honey?
GRANGER: They told your mother that you died at birth...
GRANGER: I guess you could say I'm your father...
JULIUS: One of my fathers --
GRANGER: (wistfully studying photo) 'Mary Anne Benedict'... I haven't said her name aloud for over 30 years. She was the love of my life. (shaking his head) The times I've wondered what would have happened if I'd married her...
JULIUS: Why didn't you?
GRANGER: She turned me down. Said she was afraid to have children. She took it real hard when they told her you died. She even stopped painting. Did you know she painted?
JULIUS: Until yesterday I didn't even know she might still be alive... Who told her we died?
GRANGER: 'We'?
JULIUS: I have a twin brother, Vincent.
GRANGER: There's two of you? She never                            * knew that, either.
GRANGER: Mitchell Traven. He supervised the experiment for the government.
JULIUS: I'll go see him.
GRANGER: Watch out for him -- he's kind of a dickhead, if you know what I mean.
JULIUS: No, I don't -- but I'm learning.
GARFIELD (V.O.): Mr. Webster, I hope you're happy with the vehicle we chose for your little journey. When you get to Houston, phone 713/555-0342 and                        * ask for Beetroot McKinley. He will arrange to trade you a briefcase for the merchandise in the trunk.
BODY SHOP OWNER: New Caddy? Let's check it out.
BODY SHOP OWNER: The car's okay -- I'll give you three grand.
VINCE: (deciding and getting in the car) Sorry -- the car's been promised for a kid's charity.
BODY SHOP OWNER: Okay, four grand.
BODY SHOP OWNER: (calling out) Okay -- Six thousand -- that's as high as I'm going...
VOICE (V.O.): Beetroot McKinley talkin'.
VINCE (V.O.): It's the amount of enrichment I want to talk about. McKINLEY Don't try and renegotiate with Old Beetroot, son --
VINCE: Look, Beetroot -- if we can't renegotiate we wither and die. I'm not delivering any goddam Cadillac without knowing for sure I got twenty for my cut.
VINCE: I guess twenty seems a little high to you. I'm a reasonable guy -- I'll take fifteen -- McKINLEY (V.O.) Listen to me, you poor excuse for a warmed over turd, a deal's a deal --
VINCE: -- But --
VINCE (V.O.): I can do better than five here. McKINLEY (on his feet -- in a fury) If you can do better than five million dollars, take it!                               *
VINCE: (into phone) Beetroot? McKINLEY (V.O.) What?
VINCE: I'll see you in Houston -- after all, fair is fair. (staring at the written $5,000,000) I'll just have to find it in my heart to live with your offer...
VINCE: Five million dollars!
WEBSTER                                     *: Your boss at the lot told me you                          * were on duty when the Cadillac                            * clocked in. Now what's his name?                          *
AL: Okay... His name is Vince Benedict.
WEBSTER: That's certainly a beginning.
CARLA: (to Al) I'm really disappointed in you -- ratting on your best friend.
CARLA: You knew?
AL: All three years.
CARLA: (indicating Webster; angry) And you never told me until there was a stranger listening? Shit, what about my reputation?
WEBSTER: Where can I find Mister Benedict?
AL: I'm not saying.
WEBSTER: Let me get this right -- You're protecting the weasel who's been                        * screwing your wife for the past three years.
AL: He's my friend.
WEBSTER: Well, I guess I'll have to beat it out of you --
CARLA: Stop -- I'll tell -- He lives at 1622 Westridge Place -- He's got an office at the corner of Highland and Hollywood.
AL: Thanks for saving me.
CARLA: I always loved you, Al.
AL: I love you too, Carla.
WEBSTER: (getting up, heading for the door, shaking his head) No one's gonna believe this one.
VINCE: (singing) 'Going back to Houston, Houston, Houston...'
VINCE: (startled) Jesus!
JULIUS: (panting) Vince, the most amazing thing has happened.
VINCE: You scared the living shit out of me --
JULIUS: I met one of our fathers. He told me of a man in New Mexico who probably knows where Momma is.
JULIUS: She didn't abandon you -- she didn't even know you were born!
VINCE: (feigning concern) Awww -- that's terrible.
JULIUS: And she was told that I died!
VINCE: Look, Julius, I'm in kind   of a hurry. Sammy wants me to    take the car to Houston. Much    bigger bucks when you raffle for   charity in Houston.
JULIUS: (excited) -- New Mexico is on the way to Houston.
VINCE: (snatching back map) A lot of places are on the way to Houston. I'll be back in a few days. Stay in my apartment. Run up my phone bill. Throw wild parties. Take advantage of me.
JULIUS: Vincent, we have to go see this man Traven in New Mexico!
VINCE: No we don't.
VINCE: You know -- you're right. This is fate -- destiny -- But there's no way I'm gonna drive for 1500 miles with you smelling like that --
JULIUS: (calming down) You're right -- I'll take a shower -- be right back --
VINCE: (to himself) Why does everybody have to like me so much?
LINDA: Happy birthday, Vince.
VINCE: Oh please -- It's not my birthday anymore --
MARNIE: Happy birthday, Vince.   Is Julius around?
VINCE                                    *: He's inside.                                            *
VINCE: Nowhere --
LINDA: You were going somewhere -- you weren't even going to say goodbye --
VINCE: Okay, okay -- look, you can't tell anybody this -- not even your sister -- but I'm onto something so huge it gives me a rash just thinking about it.
LINDA: Like what?
VINCE: I got something in here -- (pats the trunk) -- I don't even know what it is -- that's worth a fortune!
LINDA: (shrieks) A fortune! That's great!
NEIGHBOR: Never sleep with that man. Never loan him money. And never believe a word he tells you -- that's free advice.
LINDA: Vince...?
VINCE: (as if innocent) I borrowed a cup of sugar from her once...
VINCE: No you're not.
LINDA: I am because if you say 'no' one more time -- (suddenly shouting) -- I'll tell everybody you're hiding a fortune in your --
VINCE: (a hand over her mouth; he's beaten and he knows it) Okay, okay. Just don't let on to Julius. He thinks we're going to look up our ancestors, like in 'Roots' or something.
JULIUS (O.S.): 'Put on your red dress, baby, 'cause we're going out tonight...'
JULIUS: (embarrassed) Marnie -- excuse me -- I was just taking a shower.
MARNIE: (holding up a box                                * of cookies)                                     * I heard you singing -- I baked some cookies for you.
MARNIE: Oh -- don't mind me.
JULIUS: I hope Vince doesn't mind if I borrow one of his shirts.
MARNIE: (while eyeing Julius through her compact) Just don't try wearing his pants.
LINDA: Guess what? Vince just invited us all to go to New Mexico and Texas.
JULIUS: That's a great idea, Vince.
BURT KLANE (O.S.): Open up, Benedict! I know you're in there!
WEBSTER: (to cat) Your owner seems to be a very popular fellow these days.
WEBSTER: Howdy.
BURT KLANE: Who are you?
WEBSTER: It's not really important, is it? I wanted to feed the cat before I left.
BURT KLANE: I asked you a question.
WEBSTER: Who are you?
BOB: (helping out) We're the Klane brothers. That's Burt and Morris -- I'm Bob.
WEBSTER: Interesting genetic pool. You're looking for Vince Benedict, right?
WEBSTER: Am I Vince Benedict?
WEBSTER: So what's the difference who I am?
WEBSTER: (to Morris) Your brothers seem to have a problem with their feet. (dangerously to Morris) It could be contagious.
WEBSTER: (polite, as he leaves) Have a good, good day.
LINDA: Did Julius like the cookies?
MARNIE: I'm not sure... he said they'd provide one hundred percent of the average daily requirement of fourteen source vitamins in a high-fiber form that's an integral part of a properly balanced diet.
LINDA: I think that's good.
MARNIE: I really hope so.
VINCE: This ought to fit you.
VINCE: Whoa -- get away from that window! There's women and children out there! (staring at him) What is wrong with you?
JULIUS: What?
VINCE: You allergic to something?
JULIUS: No.   Why?
VINCE: What are those bumps doing all over your body? You're all swelled up. You look like you're about to explode.
VINCE: -- Are just born to be bad. It's you, Julius. Oooh, you are so scary...
MARNIE: Julius...
JULIUS: Let's rock and roll.
VINCE: (to the girls) It's his first T-shirt.
MARNIE: Good luck.                                               *
MARNIE: See you later.
VINCE: See if you can get us a room with a king-sized bed, okay?
JULIUS: (to Linda or to Vince) That's not necessary. I always sleep on the floor.
VINCE: Now promise me something.
JULIUS: You still think I'm making it all up, don't you?
TRAVEN: I don't know who you are and I                            * don't know what you're talking                            * about. Now get the hell out of                            * here before I call security.
VINCE: (vindicated) Well, that's that. On to Houston.
JULIUS: He's lying!
VINCE: Keep your voice down. This place is crawling with security --                              *
JULIUS: For the first time in my life, I am -- (looking for the word) -- pissed off!
JULIUS: I'm going to make him tell us the truth...
VINCE: No...
JULIUS: (indicating photo) That's our mother -- those are our six fathers -- that's Werner -- and that's you! Start talking!
TRAVEN: You turned out just like I thought you would, Vincent. What did you do, escape from prison?
VINCE: ... How did you know my name?
VINCE                                     *: Holy shit.   It's all true.                              *
TRAVEN: This room was sealed as soon as your mother gave birth.
TRAVEN: You came out first, of course... (indicating Vince) We weren't expecting him.
VINCE: (awestruck) This must be where you made the milkshake...
TRAVEN: We weren't making milkshakes. (indicating Julius) We were making the most fully- developed human the world has ever seen.
VINCE: But instead of just one perfect kid, Mom had two of us -- way to go, Mom.
TRAVEN: Wrong. The embryo split in two, but it didn't split equally. All                        * the purity and strength went into Julius. All the crap that was left over went into what you see in the mirror every morning.
VINCE: (stunned) Whoa -- I'm the crap?
JULIUS: It's not true, Vince.
VINCE: No, I want to hear this. (to Traven) I'm left-over crap? I'm no good?
JULIUS: He's wrong.
TRAVEN: Just look at him --
VINCE: You tellin' me I'm a side effect!?!
JULIUS: (at boiling point) Tell us where our mother is...                         * dickhead!
TRAVEN: (terrified) Whispering Pines... it's an artists colony... two hundred miles north of Santa Fe.
JULIUS: If you're lying to me. (the famous snarl) I'll be back.
VINCE: My life just got flushed down the toilet.
JULIUS: You're wrong, Vincent. Your life's just about to begin.
VINCE: I'm genetic garbage.
VINCE: (patronizing)                                 * I know this is a touchy subject                      * for you, Julius. But the fact is,                    * we don't look the same -- we don't                   * act the same, we don't talk the                      * same -- we don't dress the same.                     *
JULIUS: I know.
VINCE: (angry) So how come if we're the same, we're so damn different.                             *
JULIUS: We had six fathers, Vince. We're different parts of a lot of different people.
VINCE: Yeah?
JULIUS: And remember, I was taken to a beautiful island, protected, educated, loved, given every opportunity to grow, to dream, to create. But you had none of that.
JULIUS: You had nobody. Nobody to love you, nobody to trust you, nobody to encourage you. All life taught you was that the only person you could count on was yourself.
VINCE: A family?   You really think so?
VINCE: With like Thanksgiving dinner? And Christmas trees...
JULIUS: ... and a real home where you'll always be welcome.
VINCE: Always?
JULIUS: Even when you've been bad.
JULIUS: Is this necessary?
VINCE: I'm not introducing you to my mother dressed like some goatsherder from Albania. You need some new clothes.
SALES CLERK: Can I help you, sir?
JULIUS: Do I look okay?
VINCE: You look better, put it that way. We got to do something about the way you walk. You're moving a tad stiff, Jules. Ever see                         * Frankenstein?
JULIUS: I read the book.
VINCE: That's not gonna help. You got to walk like you're moving in time to music. I'm not talking about military marches now, I mean Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, Archie Bell and the Drells and a couple of white                   * guys.                                              *
VINCE: Like this... You just got to try to be cool, you know? Try these on.
JULIUS                               *: Am I cool now? --                                  *
VINCE                                 *: Mr. Ice.                                           *
MARNIE/LINDA: Wow!
JULIUS: (excited) We know where to find our momma!
VINCE: Everything Julius said was true. I'm the product of geniuses!
LINDA: I always knew that.
VINCE: Of course, but it's nice to make it official.
VINCE                                       *: And tonight we celebrate!
VINCE: Talk to her, buy her some drinks, dance with her. Girls like to dance.
VINCE: I guess you haven't done that before either.
VINCE: Well -- forget all that disco shit, everyone's seen it. When I really want to romance a girl, I waltz with her.
JULIUS: You dance with them?                                     *
VINCE: It turns them to putty in your hands.
VINCE: Okay, come here, put your feet by my feet --
JULIUS: (coming over) -- Thank you for this, Vince --
VINCE: (a pained look on his face) -- I said put your feet by my feet not on my feet! --
VINCE: I'll lead, you follow. Okay, one, two, three, turn... (AD LIB as follows) ... put your arm here -- you're breaking my fingers -- you're not wrestling a boar 300 miles south southwest of Fiji -- don't clench your teeth --
VINCE: (to Julius) Well, you've learned to waltz. Now it's time to introduce you to the wonderful world of getting shit-faced.
JULIUS: Did you know they had beer in ancient Egypt?
MARNIE: Er... no...
JULIUS: Actually it was invented by the Assyrians, but the Eygptians were the first people to perfect the malt fermentation process.
LINDA: You sure know a lot about beer.
MARNIE: He knows a lot about everything.
VINCE: Well, we're going to change all that -- aren't we, Marnie?
JULIUS: Can I ask you a question?
MARNIE: Anything...
JULIUS: Am I shit-faced yet?
MARNIE: (laughing) You're getting there.
VINCE: Please excuse me -- my back teeth are floating.
JULIUS: I better see if mine are, too.
JULIUS: You do that too, huh?
JULIUS: I don't think she really likes me.
VINCE: Piece of cake. You're nervous 'cause it's your first time. Perfectly natural.
JULIUS: Were you nervous?
VINCE: I was twelve and she was a nun -- that's real pressure.
VINCE: I got to admit it, Jules -- since I met you, life is getting better all the time.
JULIUS: For me, too, Vince! Sometimes I'm so happy, I want to pick you up and hug you!
VINCE: Hey, cut it out! Not in here!
VINCE: (to Julius) Go easy on the beer, okay?
BEETROOT: Lookin' forward to it.
BEETROOT: (to Webster) Sorry, Webster, looks like I'm doin' business with someone else.
WEBSTER: (nods) I'd do the same thing. You want the delivery, it's not your problem who delivers. (handing him a card) If you ever need me, my answering service forwards all messages.
BEETROOT: (handing card to bodyguard) Put this in my personal file. (staring at the door) God, I love a professional...
LINDA: Did you tell anybody we were coming to Santa Fe?
MARNIE: (unconcerned) Well, I phoned work and told them we wouldn't be coming in for a few days... Oh, I forgot to tell you -- we've been fired.
LINDA: (tight-lipped) Let's go to the ladies' room.
MARNIE: But we just went.
BURT KLANE: Hello, girls -- Do you mind if we sit down and enjoy the music with you?
BURT KLANE: This has gone way past a simple case of loan deliquency.
BOB KLANE: We don't like getting shot.                                *
VINCE: What are you talking about?    We didn't shoot anybody.
JULIUS: What do you want?
BURT KLANE: We want to take Vince out to the parking lot and kill him.
VINCE: That's kind of drastic, don't you think?
MORRIS KLANE: Let's go.
JULIUS: (ominous) Don't touch him.
BURT KLANE: (suddenly rough)                                  * This is not your problem -- you                          * don't want me to hurt these lovely ladies, do you?
MARNIE: (cries out) -- Ow!
JULIUS: You moved too soon...
BURT KLANE: What?
JULIUS: The second rule in a crisis situation:
MORRIS KLANE: (wary) He's starting that funny talk again...
BURT KLANE: This is no bluff -- Asshole --
BURT KLANE: Meet my cousins. (to the Klanes) Get these jerks outside.
VINCE: How many of those... rules do you have?
JULIUS: Quite a few. They were formulated by a Kendo swordsman in the 17th century, but their philosophical underpinnings can be applied to many other areas of life.
VINCE: I bet.
VINCE: Uh... we got cable TV, a fully stocked bar, free ice -- we're in great shape.
JULIUS: Where you going?
VINCE: I thought I'd just go and tuck Linda in for the night.
VINCE: Maybe read her a bedtime story. (with a wink) Don't wait up for me.
JULIUS: What a day, Vincent, we visited our birth place. We bought new clothes. We danced the waltz. We get into a fight -- We've got this great room. (heart-felt) It just doesn't get any better than this.
VINCE: Oh yes it does.
JULIUS: (calling out) You forgot your key -- I know. Lucky I waited up.
MARNIE: Hi -- Vince and Linda want to be                        * alone, so I'm afraid I'm going to stay here. Which bed should I take?
JULIUS: (stunned) Either... I always sleep on the floor.
MARNIE: Good night.
JULIUS: Good night.
MARNIE: This mattress is awful.
MARNIE: Sorry.   Good night.
JULIUS: Good night.
MARNIE: This mattress is just as bad as the other one.
JULIUS: Good night.
JULIUS: Are you cold?
MARNIE: It's alright.
JULIUS: No, please, take my shirt.      I'm               * baking.
JULIUS: You still cold?
MARNIE: Just my legs.
JULIUS: Well, I could give you my...
MARNIE: (sitting up) Thanks.
JULIUS: Anything else?
MARNIE: I'd love a glass of water.
JULIUS: (realizes that he's now nude) Right.
MARNIE: Oh, great!
MARNIE: Do you mind if I share your blanket? -- Mine's all wet.
JULIUS: (gulps) No -- that would be okay.
MARNIE: Could we switch sides?   I like to sleep on the left.
JULIUS: Sure.
MARNIE: Can I ask you something for a change?
JULIUS: Anything.
MARNIE: Do you like me? I mean, even a little bit?
JULIUS: I... I'm crazy about you, Marnie. But there's something about me you ought to know.
MARNIE: What?
JULIUS: (looking away) I'm a virgin.
VINCE: (under his breath; counting) -- Eighteen -- nineteen --
LINDA: You sick or something?
VINCE: Julius gave me a few pointers -- (counting) -- Seventy-five -- seventy-six -- I don't need to exercise, but Mom's gonna see me for the first                       * time in thirty-five years, I wanna look my best.
LINDA: She'll love you whatever you look like.
VINCE: I know she will -- I have that effect on people -- (counting) -- One hundred and forty-three --                      * one forty-four --                                      * (beat) -- I just hope she's not too disappointed in Julius -- he can't help how weird he seems at the start --
VINCE: Hey -- I sleep great every night -- (beat; softer) -- what if she's disappointed in me?
LINDA: (pats the bed) C'mere.
VINCE: (final sit-up) Five hundred. (gets up) Don't want to overdo.
LINDA: If she's disappointed in you, then she's a fake -- who could want more from a son?
VINCE: (thinking about it) You're right. (a beat) I couldn't do this without you, Linda.
LINDA: I know. That's why, when we get back, I think we should move in together.
VINCE: (threatened) Whoa!   Move in together?
LINDA: I'm not saying we have to    get married or anything, and    it's not about me wanting to keep    an eye on you, either. (warmly) I just want to live with    you.
VINCE: I'm no good at playing house -- I'm grouchy in the morning, cranky in the afternoon, moody at night --
VINCE: Why don't we sleep on this, okay? I mean, I've got a big day tomorrow. (shifting gears) It's gonna be great -- taking my best girl to meet my mom.
LINDA: Am I really your best girl?
VINCE: There's nobody else, Linda, not anymore.
LINDA: There better not be, because... (quoting) 'I only have eyes for you...'
MARNIE: Are you sure you've never done this before?
JULIUS: I think I would have remembered...
VINCE: Good idea. One bunch from me, one from Jules.
MARNIE: And one from us --
JULIUS: It's very beautiful, isn't it, Vince?
VINCE: Not to mention valuable -- real estate like this must be worth a fortune.
JULIUS: (a rebuke) You mustn't always think of money.
VINCE: (innocent) You got me wrong -- I'm just saying it's nice Mom's loaded -- that's a worry she won't have to have in her old age.
CUSTODIAN: Can I help you?
CUSTODIAN: I'm afraid that's not possible.
VINCE: We've come a long way. I can assure you she's going to be very happy to see us.
CUSTODIAN: I suggest you write a letter to the Benedict Foundation stating your business.
VINCE                                     *: A foundation?
JULIUS: (indicating the bucolic scene) You think it's her? I do.
VINCE: Gotta be. (as they still stare) Well, don't just stand there.
LINDA: Introduce yourselves.                                   *
WOMAN (O.S.): (sharp and loud) Hey!
GARDENER: Should you be here?
VINCE: (tries to joke) That depends on how you feel personally about trespassing.
GARDNER: (umamused; to Julius about Vince) Is he always funny like that?
JULIUS: (very politely) We'd like to see Mary Ann Benedict please; is she here?
VINCE: Please don't do that -- look -- this isn't one of your average everyday situations -- she's our mother is the thing.
JULIUS: We're her sons.
VINCE: Twin sons.
GARDENER: -- You're comedians --
VINCE: We're kind of a surprise.
GARDENER: (takes off her gardening gloves) I'll bet you are -- follow me.
VINCE: (whispering to Julius) We were right --
JULIUS: (softly) -- It is her --
JULIUS: (confused) We thought that that woman --
VINCE: -- Is Mary Ann?
GARDENER: No -- This is an artist's colony; there's a lot of painters.
GARDENER: You can't really own something like that view over there, or that sunset, can you?
VINCE: (a believer) No, of course not.
JULIUS: (to Linda and Marnie) I can't wait to meet her.
GARDENER: This way, please.
GARDENER: Mary Anne Benedict never understood why people wanted to buy her paintings. But for a brief period they were considered valuable. She used the money to buy Whispering Pines so that young artists would have a place to work.
GARDENER: She never wanted to be famous. She just wanted to be left alone.
JULIUS: May I ask you a question? (a beat, concerned) Why do you keep referring to her in the past tense?
GARDENER: Because she passed away, some time ago.
VINCE: But -- but you said she was here --
GARDENER: She is -- I meant her spirit.   Her spirit is always here. (a beat) Excuse me.
VINCE: (behind the wheel) Can we get the hell out of here?
PAINTER: What was that all about?
GARDENER: These real estate developers won't be happy until they turn this place into a golf course.
PAINTER: Now they're climbing over the walls?
GARDENER: They're shameless. They'll try anything. (bitterly amused) Those men claimed to be my twin sons, if you can believe that. It was really quite disturbing.
PAINTER: Oh, Mary Anne, I am sorry...
GARDENER (MARY ANNE): It's alright... You get over things.                       * (with a sigh) I did have a child once, but he died                       * at birth...
VINCE: Do I look like a young artist to you, Linda?
MARNIE: (gently) Vince, all she meant was --
VINCE: (picking a fight) I know what she meant. And I know why she's here, too. It's got nothing to do with my mother and everything to do with money.
LINDA: You know that's not true.
VINCE: (hard) Bull-shit.
JULIUS: Take it easy, Vincent.   It's not her fault.
VINCE: You hear that, everybody? The                          * creature from the black lagoon                         * just put in his two bits. I                            * should have my head examined for listening to you in the first place -- deal-of-a-lifetime opportunity and I'm driving around looking for a dead mother.
JULIUS: (very sad) All I wanted was to make us into a family.
VINCE: (stands up) Family, my butt. There's no family here. There's just me and three losers -- I'm leaving.
LINDA: Vince -- quit acting crazy --
MARNIE: (stunned) He dumped us in the middle of New Mexico.
JULIUS: We'll be fine. And maybe he'll be better off alone.
LINDA: You don't know -- he's got something worth maybe millions in that trunk -- he could get himself killed delivering it.
JULIUS: He's been getting out of trouble all his life, he's good at it.
MARNIE: He may need you.
JULIUS: (voice flat, dead) I don't know much anymore -- on the island I was smart. Here, I've only made things worse.
MARNIE: Don't you realize you could make things a lot worse if you don't do something. (gently; close beside him now) Julius -- you're still very smart it's just you're not thinking so well right now -- on account of what you found out at Whispering Pines -- but you're not alone, you know -- I mean, you live long enough, everyone's mother dies...
VINCE: Okay, Beetroot -- It's time. I'll be there tomorrow -- where do we meet and trade?
JULIUS: (to Linda) Don't worry, Linda. I found him once, I'll find him again.
MARNIE: Be careful...                                              *
CREEP: (holds up cigarette) Got a light, pal?                                      *
JULIUS: (scary) Don't fuck with me... pal.
BEETROOT (O.S.): Step away from that car, Mr. Benedict.
VINCE: I thought we had a deal here.
BODYGUARD: (to Beetroot) This is it.
VINCE: This is what?
BEETROOT: (to Vince) You come here alone, unarmed? You're just a fool who stole a car, aren't you? It's a new, low-                      * cost fuel-injection system for                         * jet engines -- worth a fortune to                      * the company that brings it to the                      * market first.                                          * (ruthlessly; to                                 * Bodyguard) What are you waiting for?
VINCE: Five million dollars --
BODYGUARD: (sarcastic) You wanna count it?
VINCE: I trust you.
WEBSTER: (calling out) All I want is the money, Benedict. Just give me what's mine and you can go back to stealing cars and screwing your best friend's wife.
WEBSTER: Pack it in, Vince, you're only wasting time -- I don't give a damn about you, just the money --
WEBSTER: Vince, if you don't cut this horseshit I may have to hurt you.
JULIUS: (over) Leave my brother alone!
JULIUS: I've got the money.
WEBSTER: (gun trained on Julius) Well don't be shy -- (gesturing) -- come on down.
VINCE: No way... this is bullshit... (eyes snapping open) Julius, you putz.
WEBSTER: Just exactly who are you?
JULIUS: Vincent's twin brother -- we're in this together.
WEBSTER: Keep your hands that way.
JULIUS: Don't be nervous -- I hate violence and I never carry guns.
VINCE: (muttering) Goddam ESP-psycho-voodoo bullshit...
JULIUS: I needed something to read on the airplane.
WEBSTER: (raising rifle) Yeah, well your flying days are over...
VINCE (O.S.): Put the goddam gun away -- you're a multimillionaire.
VINCE: I am never going to forgive you for this.
JULIUS: You were going to get killed. I tried to distract him so you could escape.
JULIUS: So, why didn't you go?
VINCE: Because, thanks to you, I'm now not only a godamn psychic, I've got this disease called a conscience!
JULIUS: Nobody ever said being good was easy.
VINCE: How am I going to survive out there? What are my friends going to think?
JULIUS: (smiling) You haven't got any friends.
WEBSTER: Just what are you two talking about?
VINCE: (to Webster) Butt out, okay? This is family stuff, we're squabbling, it's personal, just take the money and go sit in the lap of luxury somewhere. Try Brazil.
WEBSTER: (cocking his shotgun) I doesn't work like that, you might talk to people -- (aiming the rifle now) Who wants it first.
JULIUS: Shoot him.   This whole thing is his fault.
WEBSTER: Whatever you want.
VINCE: (amazed) You can be an irritating pain -- but sometimes you come in handy. -- Where'd you get the gun?
JULIUS: From the dead man in the car.
VINCE: (to Webster) You should have checked if he had a gun, chump.
WEBSTER: He said he didn't believe in them.
JULIUS: (proudly) I lied.
VINCE: (teasing) Ooooh -- you lied?
JULIUS: I had to.
VINCE: Looks like you messed with the wrong people, wise guy.
WEBSTER: (smiling) But your luck just ran out.
WEBSTER: Drop the gun and give me back the case, or we're gonna have ourselves some barbecued Benedict.
WEBSTER: Well, I guess this is goodbye.
JULIUS: Wait a minute.
JULIUS: You've forgotten something.
WEBSTER: I don't think so.
JULIUS: The third rule in a crisis situation.
JULIUS: (smiling) Duck.
VINCE: (even more amazed) Duck? (can't believe it) Duck? You are developing real style, Julius.
JULIUS: You came back for me.
VINCE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
JULIUS: I always knew you would.
VINCE: You're my brother, right? (as Julius smiles) We're family, right?
JULIUS: Thank you, Vincent.
VINCE: (with a gleam) We're a rich family, right?
JULIUS: We're a good family. I'm sorry, Vince, but we have to return the money.
JULIUS: -- Including us -- think how much                       * better you'll feel when it's out of our lives --
VINCE: (almost jumping up and down) -- I won't -- I won't feel one bit better -- I'll never feel better, not if I live to be... oh no --                         *
PAINTER: I think you'd better read this...
MARY ANNE (O.S.)                         *: You stole my family, you lying son of a bitch!
VINCE: Linda, I --
LINDA: What the hell are you doing here?
VINCE: You wouldn't answer     my calls or my letters, so I...     Look, I made a terrible mistake     and I apologize and I want to tell     you that I'm a changed man.
LINDA: How did you get in here?
VINCE: Well, there was a window in the back that --
LINDA: (resigned again) Typical.
VINCE: All I ask is for another chance. I know I probably don't deserve it, but --
LINDA: You're right, you don't deserve it.
VINCE: I had to break into your apartment, but --
LINDA: Vince, they're beautiful.
VINCE: So, do you forgive me?
LINDA: Yes, but...
VINCE: But?
VINCE: You mean, that matter we talked about once and never really resolved.
LINDA: (feigning ignorance) What matter is that?
VINCE: The matter of you and me living together.
LINDA: (haltingly) What about it?
VINCE: Your place or mine?
VINCE: (into phone) What do we do? Most people on this planet cause problems -- the Benedict Corporation solves them. We're a consulting firm -- a think-tank -- sort of like the Rand Corporation -- only smarter! (a beat) Tuesday at three. See you then.
JULIUS: Look at this, Vince -- proposals from the Red Cross, UNICEF, the World Health Organization -- we should only have clients who do humanitarian work.
VINCE: Just as long as they pay -- we're not running a charity, you know.
VINCE: Come in!
MARY ANNE: It's so incredible I'm not even sure which one of you is which.
MARY ANNE: You see, I didn't believe you, I mean who would believe a story like your story -- crazy -- They lied to me all these years... And they lied to you... But you found one another ... And you found me... Please -- God -- one of you say something.
VINCE: (softly) Momma?
JULIUS: (softly) Mamma?
VINCE: (anguished wail)
MARY ANNE: I just can't get over how alike they are...
JULIUS: They kepp you up all night again, too?
JULIUS: (to baby #1) I think you need your diaper changed. (to baby #2) What a surprise -- so do you.
VINCE: (checks his babies) Not you, too -- It's not a competition, you know.
JULIUS: Just think what we'd be like if we'd been raised together.
VINCE: Now that's a scary thought.
