KAUFMAN: Take my advice. Withdraw your funds from the bank and spend them somewhere else.
CHOLO: (Quietly) Don't do this to me. Don't do this to me.
AUFMAN: I'm sorry, but...
CHOLO: No, no, no. Three years! Three years I been cleaning up after you, taking out your garbage, and you tell me I'm not good enough? You're the one who's no good. You are no fucking good. And you are gonna let me in. You know why? Because I know what goes on around here. How many of your fucking "members" know what's in that garbage I take out for you?
KAUFMAN: Maybe we should talk about this when you're less excited.
KAUFMAN (CONT'D): Softly) I won't be needing this man any more.
I: w
RILEY: (To Slack) Why you? In that arena. Why did the little fat man throw you in with those things?
SLACK: It wasn't the little man. It was the big man. The man upstairs. He's got his fingers in everything down here. If you can drink it, shoot it up, fuck it, or gamble on it, it belongs to him. He's just seein' that we get a few cheap kicks so we don't go thinkin' too hard about why he's eating steak and the rest of us are lucky to get the bones.
RILEY: Same question. Why you?
SLACK: They found out I was working with Mulligan and his people. Tired of eatin' off Cbones.
HARLIE: What can you do? Every place is the same.
RILEY: Places with people. I'm gonna find me a place where there ain't no people. North. Canada.
SLACK: Wherever you're going, take me ith you.
CHARLIE: He won't. Riley likes to be alone. He might take me. Cuzz havin' me around is pretty much the same as bein' alone. (Glancing at Riley) can make myself useful. And I an shoot.
CHOLO: We're taking the truck out. Get he guys.

CHOLO: (Flashing an official-looking paper) Takin' the truck out.
DEPOT GUARD: You just got back in this morning.
CHOLO: Nobody gets a day off these days.
DEPOT GUARD: (Taking Cholo's paper) Hey, wait a minute this is from yesterday.
CHOLO: (Keeping his cool) Oh, I must have given you the wrong one. Here...
CHOLO (CONT'D): What's that?
DEPOT GUARD: Relax. Just target practise.
GUS: Double or nothing?
BARRETT: Sure.
GUS: Quit scratching around back there. You're tryin' ta fuck up my aim.
BARRETT: I'm just standin' here. I'm not doin' nothing.
CHOLO: What's that? Screaming practice?
CHOLO: (Stopping them) Ain't our fight. Stenches are making it easy for us.
FOXY: Should we send up some `sky flowers'?
CHOLO: No. Those things want to get in here...let `em in.
KNIPP: Phone call, sir.
KAUFMAN: Thank you, Knipp. I'll take it.
KAUFMAN: Yes?
CHOLO (O.S.): aufman?
KAUFMAN: Ah. The one that got away.
CHOLO (O.S.): You said we should talk when I was less excited. I'm a lot less excited now.
KAUFMAN: What do you want, Mister DeMora?
CHOLO: I can't have a place in the Green, fine. I'll go find another place. But you know what I'm gonna need? Money. I want my money out of your bank. And I want the rest of the money out of your bank. And if you don't give it to me, I'm gonna blow you out of your fuckin' ivory tower. I've got Dead Reckoning.
KAUFMAN: That's unfortunate.
CHOLO (O.S.): Put the money on a boat and send it across the river to the South Side. Tenth Street Pier. One man to drive the boat, no more. You've got till midnight. Four hours. I won't be there. Dead Reckoning won't be there. But I'll know if it happens. I'll know if it doesn't happen.
UTHERLAND: Trouble?
KAUFMAN: In a world where the dead are returning to life, the word `trouble' loses much of its meaning. (Beat) He wants money.
SUTHERLAND: Pay him.
KAUFMAN: We don't negotiate with terrorists. There are other options.
ECURITY GUARD: Which one of you is Denbo?
KAUFMAN: Mister Denbo. Come in. Can I offer you a drink?
RILEY: I don't drink.
KAUFMAN: Well, then...please sit down.
RILEY: Nobody else is sitting. I think I'll just stand here, like the rest of you. While you tell me why I'm standing here.
AUFMAN: We need you to repossess a vehicle that belongs to us. The vehicle you designed, Mister Denbo. Dead Reckoning has been stolen. By your second in command. I want him captured. Or killed. And I want my two-million-dollar piece of equipment returned.
ILEY: The truck.
KAUFMAN: Which has guns. Big guns. That could do a great deal of damage if he were to aim them at this city.
RILEY: Why don't you just send out your troops?
KAUFMAN (CONT'D): an you find Dead Reckoning?
KAUFMAN: By midnight.
RILEY: I have a way.
CHARLIE: I like the iron I already got.
SOLDIER: This piece fires fourteen rounds a second.

KAUFMAN (CONT'D): illsbury.
SLACK (CONT'D): Impressed) Damn.
PILLSBURY: I come here to do sumthin'. Not stann aroun'. Why we stann aroun'? Less go do sumthin'.
CHOLO: At midnight. Give me a call. Let e know if we're rich or not.
HARLIE: Geez. Cholo made a mess.
RILEY: Cholo didn't do all this.
CHARLIE (CONT'D): ff-center. But I got him.
PILLSBURY: If they is more, we gonna need o guns. Pull `em out n'stann up wid us, like de man you ain't.
RILEY: Riley Denbo. Calling the Green.
SUTHERLAND: What?
TROOPER: Wiped out! That's what he said! Denbo! He said the depot was wiped out by stenches!
KAUFMAN: Thank you. Keep us informed.
CHARLIE: Gotta go get the keys, Riley.
RILEY: Ain't no keys to get. Melted.
ANOLETE: Screw keys. Hot wire the fucker.
H: e feelin' better since I hit `im.
SLACK: up. Dead is dead. And that ain't you. And that ain't me.
LACK (CONT'D): orry, man. I truly am.
AUFMAN: I recognize that some of you are concerned. We've been threatened by a disgruntled employee. I've sent people out to take care of the problem. However, should something go wrong, I want to assure you that measures have been taken. I've established outposts. With food and supplies to support us on our way.
LIFF: On our way? To where?
KAUFMAN: Alternate sites have been chosen. Air transport has been arranged. For us and our families. As well as necessary support personnel.
CLIFF: What about all the others?
AUFMAN: All the others can be replaced. y others.
LIFF: But...
KAUFMAN: Cliff, let me talk to you for a moment.
UTHERLAND: (To Styles) Pretty soon it's going to be one of us.
CHOLO: If I don't have this truck, I'm no different to Kaufman than that poor Mexican bastard out there.
CHOLO: He knows it's his ass if he doesn't.
RILEY (O.S.): Turn left up here.
ILEY: How long since you been out here?
SLACK: Never been out. Lived in the city since...it was a regular city.
ILEY: Pull over.
SLACK: (Surprised) Huh?
RILEY: You said you were going to make yourself useful. Right now what I could use is for you to pull over.
RILEY: I made a deal with your boss. Find Cholo. I'm gonna do it. Keep him from blowing up the Green. I'm gonna do it, I don't want people to get hurt. Bring back Dead Reckoning... Sorry. That's where I stop. I didn't ask him for much, just guns, ammo, and a car. I've got the guns. I've got the ammo. And if I find Dead Reckoning I'm gonna have the best fucking car that's ever been built, and I'm taking it to Canada. If any of you don't like that idea...
CHOLO: Mouse. Anything?
CHOLO: That's why we're here.
RILEY: Shit. He's going to Ross Park.
SLACK: What's there?
RILEY: Powder magazine. Where they keep the big boomers. Rockets. For Dead Reckoning's cannons.
KNIPP: Any word from Mister Denbo, sir?
KAUFMAN: No. Pack us up. We might have to be leaving.
KNIPP: In the helicopters?
KAUFMAN: We'll only need one of them.
FOXY: Looks like no one's here.
SCAR: I'll go.
SUTHERLAND: How much is Kaufman paying you and your men?
SCAR: This place is important. The men here wouldn't just walk out.
FOXY: Maybe they had no choice.
FOXY (CONT'D): There could be stenches in there. (Readying his M-16) Got a flashlight?
SCAR: Brubaker! You okay? Where's the other guys? What happened here?
CHOLO: That's good. That's all we need.
FOXY: (Sober) To blow up the Green.
RILEY: Cholo's moving out. Looks like he's heading right for us.
RILEY (CONT'D): hit. Off this hillside...they can shell the Green. Pull in! There!
RILEY (CONT'D): hey'll be coming up this road.
RILEY: (To the Others) Y'all stay here.
SLACK: You're goin' out there alone? You need our guns.
RILEY: Dead Reckoning's got steel skin an inch thick. You can't shoot your way in. I'm hopin' I can talk my way in.
MANOLETE: He's gonna steal the truck and leave us here.
CHARLIE: Riley'd never do that. Just look at him, you can tell he'd never do that.
RILEY: Keep an eye on the hatches. If I get in, I'll try to leave one open.
PILLSBURY: I like dat man. You go help `im. I take care of dis sissy.
GREASY MAN: I don't know about this. I mean...
CHARLIE: Everything's cool back there.
CHARLIE (CONT'D): Too late to send me back.
RILEY: Put on your Sunday smile. Try to look friendly.
CHARLIE: I am friendly. Just look at me you can tell I'm friendly.
CHOLO: Denbo. And his idiot. (Beat) Stop. Gimme the mike.
CHOLO (CONT'D): How'd you get up here, Riley?
RILEY (CONT'D): Truck's got a little transmitter in her belly. Sorry I never told you.
CHOLO: You were always a smart guy, Riley. Much smarter'n me.
RILEY: You went and took off without inviting us along.
CHOLO: You weren't around to get invited. Anyway, I figured you wouldn't want in on this.
RILEY: We want in on anything you got goin'.
CHOLO: (To Pretty Boy) Open up.
FOXY: What're you, nuts?
CHOLO: Open up!
CHOLO: I'd rather have you in here than out there.
CHOLO (CONT'D): Who's the smart one now?
CHOLO (CONT'D): Thought you were gonna quit. Here you are still working for the man. Kaufman sent you out here, didn't he? To get the truck back.
RILEY: Yes.
SLACK: That man pulls the trigger, he's dead.
CHOLO: Who else is out there?
RILEY: Kaufman sent some guys with us. We took care of `em. I know you
CHOLO: Yup. Pretty Boy, set the cannons.
RILEY: Don't do it, Cholo.
CHOLO: Kaufman's got it coming.
RILEY: Hit the tower square, you'll kill a lot of innocent people. Miss and hit the city, you'll kill a lot of our friends. Your beef's with Kaufman, not them.
CHOLO: He's killed a lot of our friends. Every week we took out the garbage, you and me. Every month I took out
CHOLO: When the smoke clears, I'm gonna
RILEY: There won't be any fancy shit left. And money burns.
CHOLO: Not when you keep it in a safe.
CHOLO: You did something, didn't you? With your FUCKING TOY!
CHOLO: Fix it!
RILEY: Not a chance.
RILEY: Easy boys.
CHARLIE: Geez. We just made it.
RILEY: Riley Denbo calling the Green.
RILEY: I'm glad you feel that way. Because I'm taking your fucking truck.
KNIPP: (Frightened) Mister Kaufman, sir. I dunno what's happening, sir, but it sounds bad.
SUTHERLAND: All this time Kaufman's been worried about a revolution on the streets. He never thought it would
KAUFMAN (CONT'D): No. No. They can't leave. Not without me!
KNIPP: I think they just did, sir.
CHOLO: I hate you, Riley. There's something about you I've always fucking hated.
RILEY: (Smiling) Same here.
SLACK: Riley. Look out there.
SLACK: Almost lost you there.
RILEY: I don't get lost so easy. (To PRETTY BOY) We gotta get across the water.
SLACK: We could blast our way through.
RILEY: Don't want to. If the stenches got
RILEY (CONT'D): We've gotta come in above the throat.
RILEY (CONT'D): What was built to keep folks safe is gonna trap them inside. We've gotta give them a way out.
HOLO: I got it.
HOLO (CONT'D): Come on, let's go.
HOLO (CONT'D): I can't fucking believe it. (A sad chuckle) Nothin' works out. It's like...the world is spinning around and we're just...caught in the wind. Nothin' works out. Some damn thing always comes around the corner and gets you.
OXY: Your choice.
CHOLO: No, don't shoot. (A dark chuckle) always wanted to see how the other half lives.
CHOLO (CONT'D): Take the car and get outa here.
FOXY: I'll get outa here. You take the car.
PRETTY BOY: The old J&L'll take us over. Right outside the throat.
