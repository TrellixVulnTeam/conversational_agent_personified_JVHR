LIMITLESS: Written by Leslie Dixon Based on the novel by Alan Glynn
EDDIE (CONT'D): And banks became attentive. But just in case you think nothing ever happened to me....
LINDY: I don't think I can keep this. Eddie is broadsided. Hurt.
EDDIE: Just like that. She shoots him a look of almost intolerable sympathy.
EDDIE (CONT'D): I was kind of under the impression you cared a little more than just--
LINDY: If I didn't care, maybe I'd be able to stand to watch you do this.
EDDIE: Look, I'm going to give 90 pages to Mark on Friday. If you could just wait, see what he says-
LINDY: Stop. You think I don't know what you do all day? I've loved you. I know the good stuff, and I know the shit.
EDDIE: And it's all shit to you now?
LINDY: You're the one living it.
(SYMPATHETICALLY): Don't think I don't know it's worse for you.
EDDIE: Then you know I could use a friend. He tries to push the key back. He cares about her, but he's also "working" her sympathy, which she instantly smells.
LINDY: Don't you dare try that shit on me!
(CONTINUED): She pierces Eddie with a look. Doesn't take the key.
EDDIE: Well -- what'll work, then? They both almost laugh. They know each other so well. But she looks away, steeling herself.
LINDY: I see where it's going. You'll lose your apartment. And then what? You'll move in with me--
EDDIE: Not with that enthusiastic invite--
LINDY: --And then it'll go on this way, and I'll rag on you, and finally boot you out -- and then what? I mean, have you run the film?
EDDIE (CONT'D): Lindy. I really thought I had it in me to do something. --I wasn't getting around it, but it was fucking there. And now, I, ah... don't think it is. There. --Anything. At all. Lindy looks at him, clear-eyed, seeing him as he is, and loving him anyway.
LINDY: You know what...? I'd have had you move in anyway... if...
EDDIE: If, what? She looks away. Its hard for her to admit this:
LINDY: If it was me you wanted. And not Melissa.
EDDIE: I never think about Melissa--!
LINDY: I have to get back.
EDDIE: --Hey, well -- wait -- you didn't tell me what happened yesterday. We can see on Lindy's face that she's still vulnerably pleased that Eddie remembered to ask.
LINDY: I got it.
EDDIE: You got it--?!
LINDY: Yeah. I'll have my own assistant. You believe that?
EDDIE: You deserve it, Lindy.
LINDY: Yeah, thanks. I do. She smiles weakly, breaks eye contact. No good to keep looking. It's over. Eddie makes an attempt to reach for the check, which Lindy grabs.
LINDY (CONT'D): Oh, please. He knows she knows he can't pay.
VOICE: Eddie. Morgan. VERNON GANT looks him over with condescending bemusment. He's 30, wears an expensive suit, looks like he comes from money.
VERNON: Shit! It's gotta be-- 9 years--?
EDDIE: But who's counting.
VERNON: (taking him in) Hey, you!!! He genially whacks the sides of Eddie's arms. Eddie halfheartedly whacks back. Vernon sizes Eddie up.
VERNON (CONT'D): Jesus, Eddie, pack it on, why don't you?
(CONTINUED): Eddie didn't need that. He's very self-conscious about his weight.
EDDIE: Sedentary job, you know...
VERN: So you're still trying to write?
EDDIE: As a matter of fact, I've got a book contract. Vern looks half suspicious, half impressed.
EDDIE (CONT'D): How about you?
(POINTEDLY): Still dealing, Vernon?
VERNON: Do I look like I'm still dealing? Eddie sizes him up: the suit, shoes, watch, haircut.
EDDIE: No.
VERNON: Come on, let's get a drink. I wanna hear about this book.
EDDIE: Nah, I should go--
VERN: You can't tell me you're a health nut, now. Not with that tire-
EDDIE: Enticing invitation. Thanks. Vern plucks the pack of cigarettes from Eddie's upper jacket pocket.
VERN: C'mon, c'mon, one beer. Or I won't give `em back. He holds the cigarettes just out of Eddie's reach.
EDDIE: It's one o'clock in the afternoon, Vern.
VERN: When's that ever stopped you?
EDDIE: Fuck.
EDDIE: So... how's Melissa?
VERNON: Ah-hah. That's why you agreed to the beer.
EDDIE: I'm making conversation, Vern.
VERNON: Well, I don't know how Melissa is.
EDDIE: How don't you know? You're her brother.
VERNON: I don't see her. She lives upstate now, she's got some kinda internet home sales kinda job... a couple of kids... This is unfathomable to Eddie. He tries to keep his voice casual.
EDDIE: A couple of kids...
EDDIE: Who's the husband?
VERNON: What are you, jealous?
EDDIE: It's just a question, Vern. Vernon can sense his emotion.
VERNON: Walked out on her, if you really want to know. But what do you care? You guys weren't even married six months, were you--? I mean, it was just a coke thing, right?
EDDIE: Is that what she said--?! "A coke thing." It unexpectedly hurts Eddie. Maybe it's just a bummer day. Or there's a deeper wound than he knew.
VERNON: But I wanna know about this book. How's it going?
EDDIE: (considering the question) How's it going... Well... I'm behind. I'm behind on my book, and it's pretty well polluting my days and nights if you really want to know.
VERNON: How much have you written of it? A beat.
EDDIE: Not one fucking word, Vern.
VERNON: Wow. Creative problem, huh? Vern appraises him.
VERNON (CONT'D): I think I have something that can help you. He reaches into his pocket. Eddie thinks he knows what's coming.
EDDIE: Oh, no-- no, no, no-
VERNON: You don't even know what it is.
EDDIE: You're still dealing.
VERNON: No -- yeah --will you listen?! This isn't recreational. I've been doing some consulting for a
EDDIE: You mean a lab in some little Yalie's basement? Give me a--
VERNON: No, this is an exclusive product coming on-stream next year, they've had clinical trials, and it's FDA approved. A long beat. Eddie bites.
EDDIE: Okay, what is it? Vern reaches into his jacket, produces a tiny plastic sachet with his right hand, tapping something out into the palm of his left. He holds this up for Eddie to see... a TINY WHITE
EDDIE (CONT'D): What's in it? Vern puts the little white tablet on the bar.
VERN: Just take it. Get you over the hump.
EDDIE: I'm too old for this, Vernon.
VERNON: Look, they've identified these receptors in the brain that activate specific circuits, and-- you know how they say you can only access like 20 percent of your brain? Well, what this does--
EDDIE: Vernon. Look at me. Do I look good? I smoke too much: my chest is sore. A fucking corpse has more energy than I do, I've got weird aches, possible lumps, rashes, maybe they're a condition, or a network of conditions. One of these days they're all going to hold hands, light up, and I'll keel over dead. My life's in the crapper, and I DON'T think it's going to take a sudden upswing into the stratosphere if I do some brand new, shiny designer DRUG! Vern's phone rings. He holds up his index finger --shh! -and takes the call.
VERN: Gant. (beat, getting agitated) When. --I know, but when? (looking at his watch) Tell him we can't do that. He knows that's out of the question. We absolutely can't do that. Vern is edgy. Very tense. He continues:
VERN (CONT'D): No, I'm not going to tell him! You tell him -- no, now! He turns off his phone, gets up.
VERN (CONT'D): Fucking people. I'm afraid I'm going to have to leave you here, Eddie. But let's hang out again, have another beer. He takes out his business card, and places it carefully next to the little white tablet on the bench.
VERN (CONT'D): By the way, that's on the house.
EDDIE: I don't want it, Vern. Vern smiles at him.
VERN: Don't be ungrateful, now. You know how much these things cost? Eddie shakes his head.
VERN (CONT'D): Eight hundred bucks a pop. He pats Eddie on the shoulder and goes. Eddie is still looking at the pill. Which seems to be looking back at him.
MELISSA: --Oh, please, you think professional women mentor one another? You think there's some mutually supportive empathetic touch-feely network of kindly pie- bakers? --Those bitches hate each other! Quick, who was the worst boss you ever had? A woman, right?! We can't delegate, we can't command -- I mean, there's a reason we're not generals--! The men gasp, shocked and titillated. The women are furious. Melissa smiles to herself --she's trying not to crack up.
EDDIE (CONT'D): Tuesday.
VALERIE: Look, enough, okay--?
EDDIE: Just tell him-
VALERIE: Steve handles the rents. So feed your fucking bullshit to him.
VALERIE: --Like the rent's not low enough--!
VALERIE: You could be a bike messenger and come up with that! Eddie continues up the stairs. But she follows, getting in front of him.
VALERIE: --Look, I'm just telling you, he's been talking about calling these people he knows from the club to muscle you out -- I've told him not to do that, but he's really pissed. We PUSH IN on Eddie's face, into his eyes... where we see his pupils contract just slightly. A flicker.
EDDIE (CONT'D): What's wrong? She's taken aback.
VALERIE: W-What? His eyes go to THE BOOK BAG in her arms.
EDDIE: "I was blind but now I see."
(CONTINUED): On a gut instinct, Eddie takes a shot, pushing his words forward with a new, sharp, penetrating intimacy, articulateness.
EDDIE (CONT'D): You don't like me, and I don't blame you -- you see a schlumpy energy- sucking defeated sack of shit sponging off your husband. You're hoping I'll blow my brains out. But my existence shouldn't make you this upset. What is it? He's hit a nerve.
VALERIE: Look, that's none of your-
EDDIE: Something wrong at school?
VALERIE: How do you know I'm in school! His eyes flick down at her bag.
EDDIE: People who aren't don't usually carry dry, academic constipated out of print books about Dorothea Lange.
VALERIE: Are you some kind of creep? Have you been following me?!
EDDIE: I just saw the book--
VALERIE: You can only see a corner of it. How did you know? He looks down. She's right --only a corner of the book is visible. Eddie realizes:
EDDIE: I've seen it before.
EDDIE (CONT'D): If you're writing a paper, that's not the book I'd use.
VALERIE: Well, who asked y-
EDDIE: Cal Berkeley has her oral history. I'd start there. Her son is still alive. You could Google him. Sons of famous people always want to dish dirt about their parents. You'd get something no one else has, and you'd've gone the extra mile, a nice little apple for the professor. During this speech, MUSIC COMES UP and the sound goes down...
(CONTINUED): Eddie and Valerie's mouths are moving... she's asking questions... he's supplying answers, lots of them...
(CONTINUED): CLOSE UP -- EDDIE'S UNDERWEAR is tossed at the hamper - missing it by about a foot. The underwear remain on the floor.
MARK: You're kidding.
EDDIE: No.
MARK: Words have appeared on paper.
EDDIE: Yes.
MARK SUTTON: Written by you. Eddie knows he's on thin ice.
EDDIE: Three pages. That's all you have to read. If you read them in the next hour, and you don't want to keep reading I'll give back the advance.
VERN'S VOICE: Yeah?
EDDIE: Vern! It's Eddie.
VERN'S VOICE: Bad time, okay--?
EDDIE: Vern -- last night 90 pages just wrote themselves! I totally chucked the novel I pitched them --I suddenly SAW, Vern, how this whole societal economic class struggle -- and its solution -- didn't have to be futuristic or fictional -- it was actually ACHIEVABLE here, in our lifetime -- and I could just lay it out, like, like a manifesto, or something, like Mein Kampf except not by a crazy racist fuck! (no response, realizing) Okay, I won't talk any more about this if you let me in. The buzzer buzzes.
VERN: Well, that was fast.
VERN: Don't ask. Leaving the door open, Vern turns around and motions at Eddie with his left hand to come in. The place is all mismatched antique furniture -- the possessions of someone who collected once, with enthusiasm, but who's letting it all go to hell. Vern sits, keeping his injured arm elevated.
VERN (CONT'D): So, Eddie. I guess you're interested after all.
EDDIE: Yeah. That stuff's amazing.
VERNON: It works better if you're already smart. Eddie can't get over how bad Vernon looks.
VERN: You don't want to know. And Eddie wants the drug more than he wants to know what happened.
EDDIE: What's... um... what's it called?
VERN: It doesn't have a street name yet, because it doesn't have a street profile. And that's the way we want it to stay. The boys in the kitchen are calling it MDT-48.
EDDIE: "The boys in the kitchen...?" Vern, that doesn't sound FDA approved.
VERN: "FDA-approved," that's a laugh. Did you really believe that shit? Eddie stares at Vern as he pours himself a coffee.
VERN: So you want some more of it?
EDDIE: Yes. Definitely. Vern chuckles. He knew it.
VERN: We'll talk about it. But first maybe you can do me a little favor.
EDDIE: Uh... sure. Eddie wants to get on with it and get out of there, but Vern clearly has him by the balls.
VERN: You can see, I'm in no shape to go out right now. Will you hop down to the dry cleaners and get my suit? And maybe pick me up a little breakfast...? Eddie sighs. Vern tosses him a set of KEYS.
EDDIE: is no tough guy, and sweat springs to his brow. He starts shaking... then, seized with horror that they might still be in here, he edges to the bedroom. We hear THE POUNDING OF HIS HEART as he peeks in...
EDDIE: Yes... I... I need to report a murder. Eddie. Morgan. --Edward J. I won't. He puts down the phone, puts his head in his hands. VARIOUS CUTS OF: Eddie sitting. Shifting his butt in various positions. Holding a BASEBALL BAT he's found --just in case "they" come back.
EDDIE: At least you got your last meal. There are lots of takeout containers around.
EDDIE (CONT'D): You never did like to cook... Eddie's eye falls on VERN'S STOVE. Unlike the rest of the kitchen area, it's pristine. Unspattered. Eddie jumps up.
(CONTINUED): He sees Eddie, spins, POINTS HIS GUN right at him.
COP: Let me see your hands. Eddie throws his arms in the air.
EDDIE: Heyheyhey! I'm the one that called you!
EDDIE: ... No, ex-wife's brother. I just ran into him on the street and he invited me up to, you know... The Detective looks at him suspiciously.
DETECTIVE: Buy some drugs?
EDDIE: Wha-- No! Talk! What're you --
DETECTIVE: Okay, fine, what did this guy do?
EDDIE: He was -- I don't know, I heard he was sort of an antiques dealer.
DETECTIVE: A dealer? CLOSE ON THE ENVELOPE hidden in his jacket, burning a hole in his side. Eddie tries to stay calm.
EDDIE: Yeah... of, uh... Viennese kind of... chairs... sort of curlicue leg kind of things-- The phone is ringing. The detective picks it up.
DETECTIVE: Yeah. That is correct. An Edward Morgan. He's here.
(CONTINUED): Mysteriously, the Detective hands the phone to Eddie.
DETECTIVE (CONT'D): The victim's sister.
EDDIE: Melissa?
MELISSA'S VOICE: Eddie. You were there?
EDDIE (CONT'D): Right before. I'd just run into him on the street.
MELISSA'S VOICE: God.
(BROKEN): This is all so weird...
EDDIE: Melissa --you don't think I had anything to do with-
MELISSA: No, no, no, Eddie, I know that. I wish I was more surprised. He was... involved in some stuff... I better not say any more.
EDDIE: Not on this line, no. A beat. Eddie still can't believe he's talking to her.
EDDIE (CONT'D): Melissa... maybe... (a deep breath)
(CONTINUED): Do you want to... meet somewhere, or...? He lets it hang in the air for a moment.
MELISSA'S VOICE: Eddie, I've got to do the funeral. And God knows what else. I just... we can't meet, okay?
EDDIE: Then... I'll see you at the funeral.
MELISSA: No. I don't want that - please don't... I'll call you at some point, when this is over. Okay?
EDDIE: Okay. A beat. Melissa's voice is wan, vulnerable.
MELISSA'S VOICE: Okay. She's hung up. Gone. Eddie turns back to the detective who's staring intently at him.
DETECTIVE: Something doesn't jell here. Eddie tries not to look panicked. The cop looks up, taking in the entrance of THREE newly arrested HIGH CLASS HOOKERS. They are young. They are blond. They are wearing very short skirts and fuck-me heels. The cop eyes them appreciatively.
EDDIE: ...enabled me to finish the book in four days.
EDDIE: Learned to read music in a week...
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN: --is prosaic. Yes.
EDDIE: Which means a prosaic author's work rests on a foundation of acclaim-
EDDIE: So you're saying praise and fame are unrelated to achievement, that the greatest hits CD cannot possibly contain good songs? That Shakespeare's catchiness belies mediocrity?
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN: She breaks off, shrugs, smiles.
EDDIE: Well, then I'd guess you'd rather not hear about what I, personally, think could launch a thousand ships? He puts a finger under her chin. He means her face, of course. The woman smiles, and blushes.
EDDIE: ...so, Mom, your 401 K is totally mis-invested -- these guys are have done ONLY the most Pliocine era fundamental analysis and paid no attention to eye candy psychology surrounding the stock -- (realizing they're lost) Okay, remember when I explained default flops? Did any of that stick?
(THEY'RE LOST): CDS's? CDO's CBO's? His parents stare at him. They don't know what to make of any of this.
EDDIE: --Sure you get a short term spike, but wouldn't that rapid expansion devalue the stock completely in two years? A well-dressed broker - KEVIN DOYLE - shakes his head.
KEVIN DOYLE: No, no, there are safeguards--
EDDIE: Against aggressive over-expansion? There aren't, because there are no safeguards in human nature. Eddie's tone isn't aggressive -- it's genial, amusing.
EDDIE (CONT'D): We're wired to overreach -- you look at history, I mean, all the countries that ruled the world? Portugal? With its big, butch navy? All that's left is salt cod and cheap condos -- the Brits? Now they just sit on their dank little island, fussing over their suits. Nobody stops and thinks, hey, we're doing pretty well, we've got Poland and France, and a big Swiss bank account -- let's not invade Russia in the winter! Let's go home and pop a beer and live off the interest! The crowd laughs. Eddie takes a swallow of his drink.
KEVIN DOYLE: (smiles, gets it) Yeah. It'll all happen again. Eddie toasts him.
EDDIE: Hey, I want in on it! Kevin Doyle, wishing Eddie was right, clinks his glass.
KEVIN DOYLE: You must have a portfolio, but if you don't, I'd be very interested in working with you.
(CONTINUED): Eddie politely takes his card. Smiles charmingly.
EDDIE: Thank you so much.
EDDIE (CONT'D): I'd like to re-negotiate my advance.
DUNHAM: Well... sit down, we'll be discussing that.
MARK SUTTON: First, ah... I want to apologize, Eddie, if I in any way communicated a lack of faith in your abilities. Eddie smiles coolly. In control. It's Mark who's a little nervous.
DUNHAM: What would you say to ten thousand more and another forty down the road?
(CONTINUED): Eddie holds there gaze, expressionless, but says nothing. After an uncomfortable moment, Dunham continues.
DUNHAM (CONT'D): We think this could be an important title, maybe one in a series. I have to say, you came out of nowhere, but the good ones always
EDDIE: This isn't going to work.
DUNHAM: What's not going to work? The money?
MARK SUTTON: Eddie, we take you very seriously as a writer. Eddie sounds almost regretful.
EDDIE: Yes, but I now see that writing, as a profession, is for marginalized whiners not fit for anything else. Sutton thinks Eddie's kidding. He laughs nervously.
EDDIE (CONT'D): No, I mean it, look at the life. Incarceration, loneliness, burrowing down into your own psyche, increasingly insulated from any truth, because you're not in the currents of the world any more, you're rattling around inside the cage of your brain, self- cannibalizing... Dunham realizes he's losing Eddie, and jumps in.
DUNHAM: You don't think a best-selling author would disagree?
EDDIE: Oh, if you're good, there's some remuneration, eventually, after paperbacks, but at best your career'll be oozing along like a snail, a few thousand more copies, whoop-dee-doo, you're "developing a readership," -- for what? So you can end up in Phoenix on a Saturday night reading from your own work at some holdout indie book store to a bored audience of ten? --Half of them there for the wine and cheese?
MARK SUTTON: Yes, but if your goal is to have a
EDDIE: I don't think any goal will be really achievable, Mark, until I'm sitting on a large pile of cash. The mens' mouths open. Then shut.
DAY TRADER: You've got your quantitive analysis - "quants..." Algorhythms to find minute price discrepancies... you're looking at numbers only. Price and volume patterns... Eddie is staring at the screen, blocks of information forming and connecting in his mind.
EDDIE: Armed with Vern's last 800 dollars, I made 4000 in a day.
(BEAT): It was too slow.
(BEAT): Still too slow. I needed more capital...
EDDIE: Why not? The two men stare at each other.
GENNADY: Because I don't see you before. And I don't fucking like you already. Why do I give you 100 thousand dollars?
EDDIE: Because I quintupled my money four days in a row. Gennady barely glances at the papers Eddie pushes in front of him and snorts, half amused, before pushing them back.
GENNADY: You're lucky.
EDDIE: It's not luck.
GENNADY: Okay, you tricked their computer, you got some fix on the game.
(CONTINUED): Eddie now sees that it's better not to admit that he came by the money legally.
EDDIE: You think? Gennady smiles.
GENNADY: So you're a crook.
EDDIE: And that's a problem for you because--? Gennady laughs for a second. Eddie's not wrong about that. Gennady looks in Eddie's eyes for a moment, calculating.
GENNADY: You people all get caught.
EDDIE: I won't. And what if I do? You think I keep detailed records of my investors? You'll have your money back long before they figure out what happened. Gennady just looks at Eddie, thinking it over.
GENNADY: Okay, you take this... you mine. You don't pay, you know what we do? We cut you around the waist, peel your skin, pull it up over your head and tie knot in it. And you don't die from that. You suffocate. He lets the full picture sink in for a moment. Then:
EDDIE: But not for the big fat defense contract he bribed his way into. That's still on. Should be announced in a week. The trader shakes his head. How did Eddie know that?
(BEAT): By the end of the second week I had 2.6 in the bank....
EDDIE'S MACHINE: You have... 19 messages.
FEMALE VOICE: Listen, return my call, Mr. Morgan, this article's about you's gonna get written with or without your cooperation... (BEEP!)
GENNADY'S VOICE: ...you stupid shit, I be there Thursday for the money, ten o'clock!
(CONTINUED): Eddie makes a jerk-off motion, crosses to his window, looks down.
LINDY: Carl Van Loon wants to meet you?
EDDIE: Apparently he does. She is pleased for him, but flabbergasted.
LINDY: But you're not in the finance game. What can you do for Carl Van Loon? (shaking her head,
MYSTIFIED): Eddie-- I -- THE BEAUTIFUL HOSTESS appears at Eddie's side. They have a brief conversation in Italian. Lindy stares, confused, as the hostess leaves.
LINDY (CONT'D): Since when do you speak... what happened to you?
EDDIE: Self-improvement month. Someone gave me a wake-up call.
LINDY: God, Eddie -- I felt so bad about that.
EDDIE: Why? It stuck, didn't it? Lindy eyes him, half pleased, half apprehensive. He seems so different.
LINDY: You didn't do all this for me.
EDDIE: Who says I didn't? So what -- it's not getting over? Is that it? Lindy looks away, blushes. Sighs.
LINDY: All right, all right -- boy, you are really begging for it.
EDDIE: Begging for what.
LINDY: "I'm proud of you."
EDDIE: Gosh. This is so unexpected.
LINDY: I'm actually... more than proud. I'm a little... Eddie waits for her words, happily expectant.
LINDY (CONT'D): ... intimidated. They smile at each other. A lot of affection flooding back.
LINDY: What are you doing, hon?
EDDIE: Nothing. He walks back over to her, looks down. She is snuggled up in Eddie's pillow, looking very pretty and vulnerable.
LINDY: What, you think somebody's watching?
EDDIE: No. He's lying. He's not sure.
LINDY: Is there anything you want to tell me, Eddie? Now's the time. He looks back at her, eyes unreadable. He shrugs.
EDDIE: With success comes enemies.
LINDY: Old Chinese proverb?
EDDIE: No proverb. An inevitability.
LINDY: You should sleep. Isn't your Van Loon meeting tomorrow? Eddie nods, sighs, turns away from the window. Then stops. He turns pale. Is sweating.
LINDY (CONT'D): What. What. Eddie takes a step. And suddenly... He's across the room. Boom. A skip in time.
LINDY: Are you all right? He doesn't look all right.
LINDA: When was the last time you ate something? Dully the realization penetrates Eddie's fog:
KEVIN: Hey. He sits, launches in.
KEVIN (CONT'D): He'll be here in ten. Now look, since we have a minute, be warned: Van Loon's mercurial.
(CONTINUED): One minute your best friend, the next...you're a leper. And he needs direct answers... anything tentative and you've lost him forever. I think we should rehearse a few scenarios..
EDDIE: I'm eating, Kevin. There is so much quiet authority in Eddie's tone that Kevin just shuts up. But a moment later, looking at the sweat on Eddie's brow, Kevin is pecking at him again.
KEVIN: You up for this? You sure? Because I've got a little bit on the line
EDDIE: Have a toast point. Brazening it out again. Because Eddie isn't sure he can pull this off either.
VAN LOON: So. Eddie Morgan. He looks Eddie directly in the eyes.
EDDIE: Medication. I'm on special medication. Another beat. And Van Loon laughs. Pierce doesn't.
EDDIE: --Yes, that's partially what I'm
PIERCE: Pattern recognition? So that's your snake-oil? Look, if there's one thing we all understand, it's understanding itself --that's how the business works...
(SCOFFING): Pattern recognition. Please.
EDDIE: Of course, not everyone can understand the patterns. Kevin sucks in his breath. Pierce is annoyed. Van Loon is mildly amused, but not necessarily impressed. Eddie continues with his unstoppable, MDT-fueled insights:
EDDIE (CONT'D): Look, there's no time for human judgement anymore. You see a chance, you blink, and it's gone. We entered the age of decentralized, online decision- making, with the decisions being made by hundreds of millions of individual investors around the world, people who don't even know each other -- making a killing in less time than it takes to sneeze.
PIERCE: Until they weren't.
EDDIE: Same rules, even in a panic. It's not understanding how companies work. It's understanding how mass psychology works.
PIERCE: And you have a formula.
KEVIN: Well, from 12 thousand to two point eight million in ten days--
EDDIE: Yes. I do have a formula, Mr. Pierce.
PIERCE: Delusions of grandeur.
EDDIE: I don't have delusions of grandeur. A beat, as we PUSH IN on Eddie's face.
EDDIE (CONT'D): I have an actual recipe for grandeur. Kevin stares in horror. Van Loon still says nothing.
KEVIN: ..and, oh, you know, she's on the wait list... Rosemary's pretty devastated...
VAN LOON: My daughter went there. I'll call the school for you. Kevin blubbers with gratitude. Van Loon's car pulls up. Kevin pumps his hand. Van Loon looks past Kevin -- to Eddie.
VAN LOON: I don't know who you are, Eddie, or what your game is, but I'm sure of one thing: you don't work in this business. I'm up to my ass in investment guys, and you don't have their half-cocky, half-terrified line of bullshit. Which is not to say I like yours any better. He picks up a file, hands it to Eddie.
EDDIE: But these companies aren't the question, are they?
VAN LOON: What do you mean?
EDDIE: Well -- you're upmarket energy -- what do you want with these little solar/windmill/hippie outfits? Van Loon's gaze is expressionless.
EDDIE (CONT'D): --Unless you wanted to play both sides of the fence, control the whole energy enchilada. But these wouldn't get you there in emerging markets. You'd need... He eyes Van Loon, who is sitting up straighter. Eddie's hit a nerve. He smiels, whistles.
EDDIE (CONT'D): Whoa, whoa. This must be some big- ass merger you're contemplating. A flicker in Van Loon's eyes. Bullseye.
EDDIE (CONT'D): And there's really only one company with enough bling to justify a merger with Van Loon Associates...
VAN LOON: Have you been talking to somebody-?
EDDIE: Carl, it's just rationalization. He says it like it's the simplest thing in the world. Which, to a person on MDT, it is. Van Loon grinds his teeth. Wanting to talk about it, but too skittish.
EDDIE (CONT'D): Is Hank Atwood going to go for it? A long beat.
VAN LOON: You are either an amazing con artist or a very smart young man.
EDDIE: Come on -- the two of you together? The world would have to come to you begging for energy like Oliver Twist with his little bowl of gruel. A beat as the two men stare at each other.
VAN LOON: You realize that if the press got one whisper of -- I can't fucking believe I'm even discussing this--
EDDIE: It doesn't matter. It won't come off. Now Van Loon chuckles, amused by Eddie's audacity.
VAN LOON: The word "brazen" does not even begin to go there.
EDDIE: You'd have to back off Libya.
VAN LOON: Why? He's come this far-- Eddie suddenly pulls back the bait.
EDDIE: I don't think you'd want to hear about it from some shmuck who needs a ride home.
VAN LOON: You're a gusty little prick, Eddie.
EDDIE: Ooh. Now you're curious.
VAN LOON: Yeah. I must admit. You've hit a couple pretty big buttons. Go on. Tell me what you think.
EDDIE: It's getting late. Van Loon laughs.
VAN LOON: All right. You get your shot. Come to my office, tomorrow at ten, and tell me just exactly how the schmuck who needs the ride would re- structure this deal. Eddie nods.
EDDIE: I'm at your disposal. Eddie opens the car door. Van Loon eyes his building, scoffs.
VAN LOON: You don't really live here...?
(CONTINUED): Eddie smiles.
EDDIE: The Spartans weren't big on amenities.
VAN LOON: Yeah. And they eventually got their asses kicked. He gets out. Van Loon drives off.
(CONTINUED): He stops, rocked.
(CONTINUED): He notices his foot hurts when he puts it down. He has a limp.
KEVIN: Hello--? Eddie--? What are you talking about? And we CROSS-CUT between them:
EDDIE: I can't make the meeting, I'm, uh... I'm sick. It's a lame excuse, it sounds lame as he says it, but then, he's off MDT.
KEVIN: Yeah, well, you can't have the fucking flu right now -- he'll never give you this chance again!
EDDIE: I need to, ah, analyze this data- We see the two men continue to talk, Kevin growing more agitated, Eddie growing more sheepish as we HEAR:
KEVIN: ... Don't you get it?! This is your test--!
EDDIE: Well, I can't pass a fucking test right now!
KEVIN: And how am I going to look if you don't? Eddie looks pretty bad. He massages his temples.
EDDIE: Okay, Kevin. Okay. He hands up on a still-yammering Doyle. He picks up the MDT pill, looks at it.
VAN LOON: What do you know about Hank Atwood?
EDDIE: Uh... iconoclast... owns, um, a lot of Colorado... He's struggling.
VAN LOON: Uh-huh. So this is "prepared," Eddie? He shoots Eddie a look of withering contempt. Eddie holds the stare and shoots a look back.
EDDIE: What is this, Atwood 101? Everyone knows about Atwood.
VAN LOON: Where was he two years ago?
(CONTINUED): A flash of panic in Eddie's eyes. What's the right answer?
EDDIE: Nowhere. An agonizing pause. Then Van Loon nods.
VAN LOON: Two years ago Forbes didn't even have him on the radar.
EDDIE: Yeah, his Great Leap Forward. Eddie is faking it. Pierce is looking at him intently. But Eddie's staying afloat.
VAN LOON: The guy comes on, out of nowhere, so fucking strong he has me on the run. Beat me out of two properties, invests in bumfuck countries with no oil, places I wouldn't go near, sextuples his money. Eddie's glance flicks to the TV behind the bar. A WOMAN'S PICTURE flashes on the TV screen -- and he recognizes it. It's the ITALIAN WOMAN he met last night!
ANCHORWOMAN: ... found dead in her hotel room last night, victim of foul play. Eddie tries to keep his face immobile. Van Loon's voice drones on, distorted now, as we HEAR Eddie's heart pounding.
VAN LOON: ...100 billion if he has a nickel... and I have to convince him, somehow, that I can raise his game.
ANCHORWOMAN: An unidentified eyewitness has reported seeing a man with a limp leaving the scene.
(CONTINUED): Anyone with information should contact local law enforcement authorities. --Steve? Eddie bolts upright.
VAN LOON: You can't tell me he's in this to improve the fucking planet. He owns a ball team. Eddie is pale, sweaty, faint. There's only one thing to do:
EDDIE: Excuse me. Eddie dashes out. Van Loon and Pierce look at each other.
MELISSA'S VOICE: Hi, Eddie... it's Melissa. Listen, call me back as soon as you-- Eddie lunges for the phone, picks it up.
EDDIE: Melissa--?
MELISSA: (surprised he picked up) Eddie--?
EDDIE: Melissa, I want to talk to you. Please. Meet me somewhere...
MELISSA: We're talking now.
EDDIE: Nonono -- at Charlie's, across the street. At two.
MELISSA: You can't see me, Eddie.
EDDIE: Please. Melissa -- it's important, please come -- you have to tell me what you're talking about! But she's already hung up.
EDDIE: Hello, may I speak to Paul Kaplan, please?
WOMAN'S VOICE: Who is this?
EDDIE: I'm a journalist. From Electronics Today magazine.
WOMAN'S VOICE: Look... my husband died three days ago. Eddie is floored.
EDDIE: I'm... I'm so sorry. Goodbye.
EDDIE (CONT'D): I, ah, may I speak to Jerry Brady?
MALE VOICE: Jerry's in -- who's this?
EDDIE: Uh-- Bill Johnson.
MALE VOICE: Well Bill... Jerry's in the hospital...
(VOICE QUAKING): ...and he's really sick.
EDDIE: Oh my God. What's wrong with him?
MALE VOICE: We don't know. He just started getting these headaches a couple of weeks ago...? Then, uh, last Wednesday he collapsed at work...
MAN'S VOICE: Hello...? Hello...? The man suddenly looks up. Locks eyes with Eddie. Knows that he knows. Eddie leaps up, begins to run. The man leaps up and follows.
(CONTINUED): EDDIE is frozen. The TRUCK SWERVES, up on the curb. Tan Coat must dive out of the way, knocking down pedestrians like bowling pins, as the TRUCK hits a STREETLIGHT, mangling it -- then is WHACKED -- twice -- by TWO CABS piling up behind it. When Tan Coat extracts himself from the pile of prone pedestrians, his last glimpse is of-
TAN COAT: hesitates, but knows that he can't catch up. Eddie's given him the slip. This time.
EDDIE: Melissa...? He goes to her, sits. Yes, it's the same person, but dramatically, tragically changed. Her face is puffy, her pallor blotchy. There are lines under her eyes and around her mouth, lines brought on by more than the passage of a few years. Eddie tries to conceal his shock.
EDDIE (CONT'D): You... how are you doing? Melissa responds with a cynical shrug. Then, she eyes him.
MELISSA: Don't tell me I look good, because I know I don't. I didn't want you to see me this way...
(BEAT): You look good.
EDDIE: I guess I lost some weight...
MELISSA: Yeah, well, MDT'll do that to you. They regard each other for minute, unsure of where to start. Old emotions. New emotions. Shock. Dismay. Affection.
MELISSA (CONT'D): I know you've been doing it. I just read the Post. Eddie. Short-selling stocks? Second-guessing the markets? You? Come on. Eddie doesn't know what to say.
EDDIE: Since when do you read the Post?
MELISSA: These days, the Post's about all I can read.
EDDIE: Melissa, what do you mean?
MELISSA: I mean, I did it too. And I only took nine or ten hits. Vernon didn't tell you any of this, did he?
EDDIE: No. Melissa snorts as if to say, typical.
MELISSA: Well, when he told me about this amazing new drug...
(CONTINUED): I was like, down the hatch. And it was amazing. I read Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe in 45 minutes and understood it. My work rate increased... just, insanely, overnight. My boss started to hate me -- they offered me his job. And then I got scared.
EDDIE: Why?
MELISSA: I'm not stupid. I mean, nobody can keep up that level of mental activity and not crash. I stopped taking it.
EDDIE: And...?
MELISSA: I got sick. Headaches, throwing up... I went back to Vernon to see if I maybe shouldn't take another hit, or half a hit, and then he told me about... about the people who were dying. One guy didn't die, but he's a vegetable, his mother has to sponge him down every day...
(BEAT): How much have you been taking, Eddie? A long beat as they look into each other's eyes.
EDDIE: A lot.
MELISSA: Well, maybe they've worked out the bugs. Maybe... maybe this isn't the same batch... Eddie hates the look in her eyes. His hands are at his temples.
MELISSA (CONT'D): You're off it right now, aren't you?
EDDIE: Yeah.
MELISSA: Are you getting a headache?
EDDIE: Finish your story.
MELISSA: Well, I didn't take more. And I didn't die. But after a while I found I couldn't concentrate on anything for longer than ten minutes. I missed deadlines. I got lazy... and slow... put on weight... the magazine let me go. My husband checked out. Sex? Get out of here. She leans back, looks him in the eyes.
MELISSA (CONT'D): That was two years ago, and I haven't been the same since. I can't read any more -- I mean, the fucking New York Post? Eddie feels ill, physically ill, hearing this.
MELISSA (CONT'D): After this, I'm going to have a migraine for three days. And I've got to pee. Which is another thing. She gets up... goes to the Ladies room. And now Eddie sees -- she wears a LEG BRACE. Like a kid, from the old days, with Polio.
MELISSA: You have some left? Good. Go home and take it. Take the dose down, but don't just stop -- you'll die if you just stop. Try to taper off. Otherwise, the headache's just the beginning... I have to go-- Eddie, indeed, is rubbing his temples.
EDDIE: But when I run out--
MELISSA: I don't know. I have to go-- Eddie catches her arm.
EDDIE: Who invented MDT?
MELISSA: I don't know--
(BEAT): Goodbye, Eddie. He lets go of her arm. A puffy, crippled woman about to cry. She turns her back and moves away from him, stiffly, limping, without looking back.
ON EDDIE: He glances around - the coast is clear - and sets off across the street. He looks weak, ill - his breathing labored. He stumbles - catches himself
(CONTINUED): WHAM! He's pushed up against the wall of his building. Not by Tan Coat. By GENNADY THE RUSSIAN.
GENNADY: You fucking forget about me? Huh? Eddie is stunned -- Gennady whacked his head against the building pretty hard. He still clutches the MDT tablet tight in his fist.
EDDIE: I... I... ahh...
GENNADY: One o'clock? And you not here?! Eddie tries to catch his breath.
EDDIE: I'm here now!
EDDIE: I'll get you a check. Gennady turns to ice.
GENNADY: A check? A check?! You out of your fucking mind?! What you think we are, some financial institution? Eddie realizes his brain isn't working --of course Gennady can't take a check.
EDDIE: Gennady, look-
GENNADY: I cut your balls off!
EDDIE: I wasn't thinking. Look, we just need to go to my bank- OOF! Gennady has punched him in the stomach. Harder than he's ever been punched. Eddie gasps for breath... holds his fist to his body, protecting the pill. Gennady notices.
GENNADY: What you got there?
EDDIE: Gennady grabs Eddie's wrist and wrenches his hand open.
EDDIE (CONT'D): It's aspirin. Gennady snatches the pill away from him. Examines it.
GENNADY: Don't look like no aspirin I ever see! His voice drips with crude contempt.
GENNADY (CONT'D): What is it? Something good, eh? In one swift motion, Gennady pops it in his mouth and swallows it! Eddie is mute with shock.
EDDIE: That's the whole thing, plus twenty. He looks desperately ill. He can barely stand. Gennady, meanwhile, is coming on to MDT.
GENNADY: I feel good. What in that shit?
EDDIE: Aspirin and vitamins.
GENNADY: You fucking full of shit, Morgan. I know you lie about the movie script too. He wants to hit Eddie again, but thinks the better of it with all the bank cameras.
FEMALE ASSISTANT: Lindy...? I wouldn't have let him in, but I know you know him... EDDIE appears in the door, looking deathly ill.
LINDY: It's all right, Lisa. The girl goes. Lindy, sensing something dire, leaps up and closes the door. Eddie immediately collapses on the floor. Lindy kneels down to help him - competent, trying to stay calm.
LINDY (CONT'D): Eddie-- What is it--?
EDDIE: I'm sorry -- I'm sick. I wasn't going to make it home-
LINDY: Okay. Okay, I'll get you to a
EDDIE: IT WON'T HELP--! I need to get-- it's very simple: I need my pills.
LINDY: What kind of pills?
EDDIE: They're... for my headaches...
LINDY: What headaches? What are you--? (beat, realizing) Are you on some drug?
EDDIE: It's... complicated.
LINDY: Oh. Oh. So all this energy of yours, all this focus... has been some drug, Eddie?
EDDIE: Not... the way you...
LINDY: You need a doctor.
EDDIE: No. That won't-- Eddie's PHONE rings. He and Lindy look at each other. He answers it.
EDDIE (CONT'D): Hello?
VALERIE: What the hell are you doing up there?
EDDIE: W-what? There are, indeed, LOUD NOISES coming from above her.
VALERIE: Are you tearing up your floor or something?! Understanding in Eddie's pained eyes. He clicks off the phone.
LINDY: ...a smart drug...?
EDDIE: It was supposed to be legal.
LINDY: Oh, Eddie... you jerk.
EDDIE: I have a supply... stashed...
LINDY: (knows what's coming) No.
EDDIE: I just need... to get it...
LINDY: And I'm supposed to just GO?! In the middle of my work day?! To your APARTMENT to get you more DRUGS?
EDDIE: Not to my apartment. I moved it.
LINDY: You did--? Why?!
EDDIE: I was smart. I was on MDT.
LINDY: Then where did you keep it--?
(CONTINUED): He looks at her, guiltily.
LINDY (CONT'D): Oh, you prick.
LINDY: You asshole... in my fucking
A MAN: across the street. He clicks open a CELL PHONE.
EDDIE: Hi -- Have you got it? And we CROSS-CUT BETWEEN:
LINDY: Yes. --Eddie, there's someone following me.
EDDIE: Are you sure?
LINDY: He got into the cab behind me, and they're making every turn I'm making!
EDDIE: Don't get out.
LINDY: What the fuck did you put me in the middle of--?!
EDDIE: Call the cops.
LINDY: There's traffic. We're slowing down... (to the driver) Go around him! Go around!
(TO EDDIE): Shit! We're stopped dead.
(A GASP): He's getting out, Eddie -- he's walking over here- Eddie, helpless on the floor, can do nothing.
TAN COAT: Zig-zags too, not far behind her.
LINDY: Begins to scream, desperate:
LINDY: Help! Help!! Up ahead, miraculously, A COP ON HORSEBACK. He steps the horse toward her. She races over and presses her body against the side of the horse.
(CONTINUED): She's so panicked and out of breath she can barely speak.
LINDY (CONT'D): There's... a... man... chasing me. He has a long, tan -- The cop seems to be paying attention, then suddenly GRUNTS and TWITCHES, his eyes flutter, glaze... and HE TOPPLES OFF HIS HORSE to the ground... ...revealing TAN COAT, on the other side of the horse. The BLADE in his hand is bloody. LINDY runs.... tries to lose herself in a WEDDING PARTY... comes to a section of huge, decorative BOULDERS and ROCKS. Dives behind one of them. Ahead, she can see the outdoor ICE SKATERS, couples, families, enjoying the ice. It seems surreal. Several yards behind her is TAN COAT, looking behind every tree, every trash bin. Lindy picks up the phone, keeping her voice low, although she's hyperventilating.
LINDY (CONT'D): Are you still there? And we CROSS-CUT BETWEEN:
EDDIE: Yes. What's happening?
LINDY: I'm hiding, but I'm stuck. He'll find me!
EDDIE: Just be still, stop talking.
LINDY: He killed a cop--
EDDIE: What?
LINDY: He's going to kill me, Eddie!
EDDIE: Listen to me. Can he see you?
LINDY: You fucking asshole--
EDDIE: Can he see you?!
LINDY: Not yet. --I don't know what to do! What do I do--!
EDDIE: There is something.
LINDY: What?!
EDDIE: Listen to me. Reach into the bag and take one of the pills.
LINDY: S-swallow one of those things?!
EDDIE: Yes. Tan Coat is getting closer.
EDDIE (CONT'D): You will know what do to, Lindy. Take one, and you'll know.
LINDY: He's got a knife -- I can't think my way out of a knife--!
EDDIE: You'll come on in thirty seconds. And yes, you will think your way out, that's what it does. Are you taking it--? She swallows the pill.
LINDY: Yes. He's getting closer.
EDDIE: Lindy. I love you.
(A BEAT): --Lindy? Are you there? A beat. We PUSH IN on Lindy's eyes. Which are changing. Growing more steely. Determined.
LINDY: Eddie...? I feel it. She hangs up. Eddie is left looking at the phone.
LINDY'S: eyes flash. She knows what to do. Suddenly, she BOLTS from her hiding place behind the rock, tearing down the hill as fast as she can. Tan Coat is behind her like a shot.
LINDY: sits across the room, looking at him, her expression cool and composed. They look at each other, a look of understanding.
EDDIE: We'll stay here for a couple of days. We'll be powered up, we'll be able to think our way out of this... He kisses her hands. Looks into her eyes.
EDDIE (CONT'D): I'm back. All right? Lindy looks at him for a long moment.
LINDY: Who's back, Eddie?
EDDIE: I can take care of you now.
LINDY: That was never what I wanted.
EDDIE: A lot's going to happen for us. And everything that I will have... I will share with you. I will love you. Lindy's head comes up. She looks at him, steely.
LINDY: You know... you were always smart. You could have done this. Not this... but some of these things... maybe a third of these things... without any smart drug at all. A third of all this... to most people...? ...would be plenty. She gets up, turns away from him.
LINDY (CONT'D): I understand that stuff now, Eddie. And I don't blame you for taking it. No one could ever tell you, till you take it, what it can do. Invincibility in a bottle. And I know I'm going to think about taking it again every day for the rest of my life. There's eerie quiet to her tone that Eddie hasn't heard before. A matter-of-fact chill.
LINDY (CONT'D): But once you can see everything that way, mapped out like that, on a grid... and always be right...? Who'd want to wing it? Who'd want to fuck up? Who'd want to be human? She heads for the door.
LINDY (CONT'D): I just came up to say goodbye. I don't ever want to see you again. I'm not even going to stay in New York. Don't try to find me, and don't try to help me. She goes. He knows there's no point in stopping her. She's done with him.
EDDIE: Looking for me? Gennady quickly gets aggressive:
GENNADY: You think you can run out on me? You think I don't know where you are?
EDDIE: I was under the impression that our business was settled. Something is jammed into Eddie's ribs. Something under Gennady's coat. Eddie doesn't blink.
GENNADY: Walk. Gennady walks him around the corner, down some stairs, to the (deserted) ground entrance of someone's apartment. Eddie remains cool.
EDDIE: So now you're going to rob me? I thought you were a businessman.
GENNADY: I want some more of that shit.
EDDIE: What shit.
GENNADY: The pills. He whacks Eddie, hard, across the face. Eddie, stoic, on MDT, doesn't react.
EDDIE: Well, so do I. You took the last one.
GENNADY: So you get me more.
EDDIE: I can't get more -- the dealer's dead. Now Gennady smiles.
GENNADY: Oh. Well. Too bad for you. Because how you gonna go to those fancy meetings with your nose fed to my dog?
(CONTINUED): Eddie doesn't like that Gennady knows anything about his business life. But he stands his ground.
EDDIE: Nothing. I. Can. Do.
GENNADY: Make some calls. One hundred pills.
EDDIE: A hundred can't happen. The dealer's dead, I have to call three people to even get a line on-- The gun barrel is brought up beneath Eddie's chin.
GENNADY: You know I don't really do this. So clean, like this. What I do to you, I do in stages.
EDDIE: I might... be able to get ten.
GENNADY: Ten. Fuck your ten.
EDDIE: (holding his ground) Ten. And no guarantee there's more. Gennady looks at him for a long, menacing moment.
GENNADY: Oh, I think guarantee. But he's accepted the ten. For now. He PUSHES Eddie against the wall, hard, knocking the wind out of him.
VAN LOON: I won't deny you pissed me off, Eddie.
EDDIE: I was sick. I shouldn't have gone to the meeting. I tried to cancel, but Kevin imploded on me-- Van Loon looks at Eddie penetratingly.
VAN LOON: I didn't know who or what I was talking to.
EDDIE: A hundred and five, is what you were talking to, Carl. Delirium.
VAN LOON: Look, there can't be any instability. Not when you're playing at this level.
EDDIE: I sent over my revised projections--
VAN LOON: I didn't ask for your projections.
EDDIE: I know, but I think if you look at
VAN LOON: I already have. A long beat as the two men size each other up. Van Loon looks away, but a tiny smile creases the corner of his mouth.
EDDIE: I'm sorry.
VAN LOON: ...some things my team missed. So, oddly enough, I find myself... needing to fill a position.
(CONTINUED): Eddie stays cool. He's in.
EDDIE: Is it possible to construct an... imperceptible compartment?
TAILOR: Certainly, sir. How large?
EDDIE: Quite large. The Tailor nods, makes a note. He's certainly not going to ask any questions.
EDDIE (CONT'D): I would never again stash my MDT, not in an apartment, not in Fort Knox.
EDDIE: I don't want it known that I have any security. You won't precede me, you'll follow me, never less than ten steps behind... `inconspicuous' doesn't begin to describe you. You're not there. You're a CEO'S wife -- you're wallpaper. The men nod. They understand.
TECHNICIAN: Well, it's nothing you can cook up on a stove top. Whoever made it, it's a real pro act.
EDDIE: Can you make more?
TECHNICIAN: Can I combine these ingredients in the same exact quantities? Yes.
(CONTINUED): But the exact method of delivery to the brain...? Darts at a dartboard.
EDDIE: Meaning...?
TECHNICIAN: Clinical trials. Guinea pig people.
EDDIE: That's too long.
TECHNICIAN: It's what it is. Or you'll kill people. You need twelve, eighteen
MONTHS--: Eddie tosses the envelope back at him, gets up.
EDDIE: Two million dollars if you do it in six. He holds up the packet. The guy considers. Then slowly reaches for it, taking the MDT back.
EDDIE (CONT'D): I thought we straightened this out, Detective.
DETECTIVE: This isn't about Vernon Gant, Mr. Morgan.
(CONTINUED): Fear begins to prick the back of Eddie's neck. But he strives for casual annoyance.
EDDIE: What is it about? The DETECTIVE hands Eddie a magazine.
DETECTIVE: A witness identified the Donatella Alvarez suspect as this person. You want to tell me about your whereabouts on the night of June
MORRIS BRANDT: You're lucky somebody wiped the room. Weak circumstantial at best. Just between us -- were you there?
EDDIE: I don't remember.
MORRIS BRANDT: Busy life.
(CONTINUED): He's heard it all, and doesn't really care.
EDDIE (CONT'D): ...well, a unified front between Van Loon and Atwood would be lethally effective, and not a moment too soon.. SyCorps, Andine and others are jockeying for the same industrial concessions in Mexico that both our companies are secretly sniffing out...
HANK ATWOOD: How do you know this?
EDDIE: Well, the governmental bribe structure is, in itself, corrupt, so of course information about its inner workings, like anything, can be bought. And there are other barbarians waving cash at the gates. I have a list here, in descending order of threat... Atwood rubs his temples, seemingly distracted. But then, he looks at Eddie piercingly.
ATWOOD: Go on.
VAN LOON: Eddie...? What's your read.
EDDIE: It flew. Of course, he's not going to tell you right now...
(CONTINUED): Van Loon notices -- Atwood is using a cane.
VAN LOON: Jesus. He seems frail.
EDDIE: Might be an act.
VAN LOON: Yeah, doesn't track. He's not even
EDDIE: When this is over?
(SMILES): I don't know. You haven't given me the answer. Van Loon eyes him. Eddie is only half kidding.
VAN LOON: You haven't asked the question.
EDDIE: All right. If all this comes off... what's my take?
VAN LOON: You should have pre-negotiated.
EDDIE: I trust you.
VAN LOON: You shouldn't. Eddie returns Van Loon's look coolly, implying that it really might be in Van Loon's best interest to trust him.
EDDIE: Well, given the scale of my contribution, it can't be anything lese than forty. Let's say forty- five.
VAN LOOK: Done. Forty five thousand dollars.
(CONTINUED): Both he and Eddie start to laugh.
VAN LOON: Forty million's plenty, Eddie. There's plenty more where this came from. He tries to read Eddie's smile which is removed, far away...
VAN LOOK: ...But you're not going to continue working for me, are you? Eddie opens his mouth. Pauses.
VAN LOON: Don't lie. You're already bored. Onto the next...? Van Loon didn't get to where he is for nothing.
(SMILES): And I'm not sure I want to know. Might singe my ego. He shakes Eddie's hand.
REALTOR: ... three restaurants, health club, of course, a private screening room, wine cellar, walk-in humidor... unparalleled, three-tier security system... Eddie looks out over the city, feeling a surge. Yes.
EDDIE: What is the asking price?
REALTOR: Twelve point five. Eddie has to look away from her, biting his lip. He can't show her any sign of sticker shock. The face he turns back to her is composed, even blase. He shrugs -- no problem! We see an almost sexual excitement dance in her eyes.
GENNADY: Next week...? I require twenty pills.
EDDIE: Next week? You can fuck yourself.
(BEAT): Not that you'll feel anything.
(CONTINUED): Gennady's eyebrow goes up. Gennady's security guys reach into their jackets. So do Eddie's guys. Gennady's eyes flick over the situation, motion to his guys to keep still. Gennady laughs, an unpleasant sound.
GENNADY: I don't think your Forbes 400 new financial friends would appreciate the details of your little dilemma with the police? Gennady turns with a flourish and walks off. Over his shoulder, with smug confidence:
GENNADY (CONT'D): Thursday. You have them here. Gennady turns, walks to the curb, where a NEW BLACK TOWN CAR is waiting for him and his boys.
PIERCE: Well, you want to call it?
ASSOCIATE #1: Cold feet.
VAN LOON: There was all last night to tell us that. Van Loon pushes the intercom.
SECRETARY'S VOICE: Not yet.
EDDIE: Okay, the decision could have changed -- that makes sense -- but the discourtesy doesn't.
(BEAT): It's still on.
PIERCE: Oh, based on your graphs and projections?
EDDIE: I saw his eyes: it's on.
PIERCE: You know, remind me: who the fuck, exactly, are YOU?! --I'm sorry, Carl, I'm about at the end with this unqualified, posturing little-
VAN LOON: Pull it back, Pierce.
PIERCE: Since when is this little pisher the fucking Delphi Oracle?!
SECRETARY'S VOICE: Mr. Van Loon, Mrs. Atwood is here. Eddie and Van Loon look at each other. What? Van Loon nods at Eddie; the two men get up. Pierce starts to get up too.
VAN LOON: Pierce, you can stay. Pierce looks bitter -- chastened -- as Van Loon and Eddie go.
(CONTINUED): Van Loon and Eddie can't imagine what's coming next.
EDDIE: I realize that this is a useless platitude, but... if there's anything we can do...
VAN LOON: Obviously we want to be as helpful and respectful as possible.
VAN LOON: You think there's a proxy?
EDDIE: Cagey fuck like him giving away power of attorney? Eddie shakes his head. The two men look at each other darkly. The driver closes her door, turns -- and now Eddie can see his face. It's TAN COAT.
(CONTINUED): With a huge, angry scar slashed across his cheek. Eddie and Tan Coat look at each other. A steely moment of recognition. Tan Coat turns away, gets in the driver's side. Van Loon watches the car pull away.
VAN LOON: Well. He'd better get better. We PUSH IN on Eddie's face. Who now knows.
MORRIS BRANDT: I've been all over them... we can't allow any disparity in race or physical type between you and the rest of the lineup -- they're as close to your clones as I could possibly get away with -- it's going to be one big handsome blur to this guy- A FEMALE COP approaches Eddie.
FEMALE COP: Mr. Morgan...? I need you to change your jacket.
(CONTINUED): Eddie stiffens.
EDDIE: Why?
MORRIS BRANDT: Oh, that's me... I want everyone in the same shirt, better for the blur factor... A beat.
EDDIE: Of course. Another beat of hesitation... then Eddie hands Brandt his jacket, takes off his shirt, puts on the blue shirt... and stoically follows the female cop through the grubby door.
MORRIS BRANDT: Not the dimmest clue. He was dithering. Eddie blinks at him.
FEMALE NEWSCASTER: ...And the Dow has been yo-yoing all day, amidst speculation that Van Loon Associates and Hank Atwood have negotiated a merger... Van Loon turns to Eddie, furious, agitated.
VAN LOON: Have you been talking to anyone?
EDDIE: Not a word, Carl.
VAN LOON: Where have you been, Eddie--? This is the second time you've turned to
EDDIE: Personal time, Carl. Phone off. You're not telling me there's been any movement.
VAN LOON: No. Atwood's in a coma.
EDDIE: A coma? Black looks between them as the newscaster continues.
VAN LOON: Eddie--? This came for you. Eddie looks at a LARGE BOX on Van Loon's desk. Indeed, his name is on it. Eddie, mystified, approaches it. As Van Loon continues to stare at the TV, disinterested in the box, Eddie gingerly opens it.
VAN LOON: What are you doing, Eddie--?
(BEAT): Was there anywhere... We begin to REWIND... in Eddie's mind... through many IMAGES we've seen in this movie... stopping briefly at all the places Eddie has stashed his MDT.
(CONTINUED): It was my inner door. Someone was in the building, ten feet away, right now. Eddie walks to his phone, picks it up. Pushes the button, puts it to his ear. It's dead. He pushes the "on" button again and again. Nothing. The buzzer BUZZES again. Eddie rushes to the door, opens the COAT CLOSET. In the closet is a state-of-the-art SECURITY MONITOR. Gennady and TWO MEN are outside his door! Suddenly the MONITOR goes BLACK. Eddie flicks the switch on the monitor. Nothing. Eddie flicks the switch again. It's dead. Someone, somewhere, has figured out how to disarm it. The buzzer BUZZES again. Eddie backs away from the door. We HEAR Eddie's shallow, panicked breathing. He lunges for his briefcase, pulls out his CELL PHONE.
(CONTINUED): So, my foggy brain tried to remember... where one tablet of MDT... might be. We PUSH IN on Eddie's eyes... We are still REWINDING in Eddie's mind... images of where we've seen him keep MDT... nothing... nothing... nothing... We STOP at the SUGARBOWL on Eddie's dining table. Then go forward --no, wait!-rewinding, stopping again on the SUGAR BOWL. Pushing in on the sugar bowl. Eddie spins around, looks back into his apartment, eyes intense.
DRILL:: MORE JUMP-CUTS as Eddie hysterically tears the packing paper off of promisingly- shaped objects. --No. A glass. --No. A vase. --YES! The sugar bowl. With sugar still inside! Eddie rummages, frantically, among the sugar cubes as the door gives a few inches, groaning, and we glimpse blurred faces on the other side...
EDDIE'S HAND: pokes, wildly, among the cubes... pushing them aside, revealing at the bottom of the bowl- ONE MDT TABLET looks back up at him. Yes. It's really there! Eddie grabs it, just as, with a splintering CRASH! -- The door goes down. Eddie steps back, brings the pill up to his mouth... But as he steps, he TRIPS on a SOUP CAN he's scattered... he FALLS backwards... his HAND hits the side of the coffee table...
(CONTINUED): The MDT TABLET goes flying... (slow motion)... as... ...also in slow motion, Gennady and his two thugs smile as they advance into the room... THE MDT TABLET... flies... flies... towards a GRATE in the floor -- a heating vent -- and HITS it... rolling... ... before disappearing forever down the grate. Eddie knows that's it. His life has ended. He sucks in his last breath -- then, with a YELL, he rushes back for the terrace... for his suicide leap... Thug #1 is quicker. Gets to the door first. Eddie will not have the luck to be able to jump. He's trapped between the two Thugs.
GENNADY: I told you I want more. You don't listen. Maybe you think I'm joking... He reaches into his coat pocket...
GENNADY (CONT'D): But I'm down to this last one. ...and pulls out a syringe.
GENNADY (CONT'D): See, I dissolve pill in solution. You shoot it - goes straight into blood and to brain. Works much better. He pulls the plastic sleeve off the needle. Jabs himself in the arm and injects the cloudy liquid.
GENNADY (CONT'D): Now. Where do you keep yours? Eddie is backed to the wall. Nowhere to go.
EDDIE: I'm plum out. Gennady just smiles -- that was an unfortunate choice. He gives an order to the Thugs who grab their tools and disappear deeper into the apartment. WE HEAR them starting to tear things up. Gennady and Eddie are alone.
GENNADY: They will find it. Or I will make you tell me. Which is quicker? We see, huh?
(CONTINUED): He clicks open a BLACK ATTACHE CASE. It is filled with sinister-looking silver instruments, and knives.
GENNADY: This is a waste of my time, you know that? I am getting out of this part of the business... starting import-export company. Very exciting stuff. A lot on my plate. I need to learn to delegate... Eddie is backed up against a table, which is covered with stuff he's scattered, which includes a BUTCHER BLOCK with A KNIFE in it... Gennady starts arranging his instruments.
GENNADY (CONT'D): First, I will cut skin from you, flay you... you stay alive nice long time... then maybe we cut meat from you, steaks... or maybe softer parts... I get inspiration... He looks up, smiles, to see the effect his words have on Eddie.
ON EDDIE: Staring back at Gennady, hard, a fuck-you stare. We can't see behind Eddie's back, but we can see the butcher block, and the knife is gone.
GENNADY: senses something is not right. Looks at Eddie quizzically.
GENNADY (CONT'D): Eddie brings the knife up as hard as he can, right into Gennady's stomach. Gennady gasps in surprise, chokes, writhes. Eddie drives the knife home, harder, grabbing Gennady's other hand, which lashes at Eddie with the fillet knife...
(CONTINUED): The men fall to the floor in a death-struggle. Eddie exhausted, off MDT, but determined not to let go. Gennady writhes, flails, but doesn't cry out... he's already choking on blood. Eyes shocked, surprised. Eddie turns the fillet knife back on Gennady, slashes at his other arm; blood spurts. But it's not necessary. Gennady's eyes are glazing. His gurgling gets quieter. He's quite dead. Eddie lies alongside him, panting, arm grazed and welling blood from where Gennady's filleting knife slashed him, suddenly weak and exhausted. From the other room comes the BRRRRRRR! sound of the drill -- the boys, oblivious, are hard at work on the safe. Eddie tries to get up, then falls back.
(CONTINUED): And its middle finger has been arranged in a vehement fuck- you. The thugs are not amused.
THE THUGS: look up at a NOISE. Just in time to see Eddie bolting out the front door of the apartment.
(CONTINUED): Eddie DIVES BACKWARDS, through the broken glass door to the patio. The thug stumbles after him...
(BEAT): And the night was still young.
EDDIE: I'm sure you're curious about what's happened to your boss. I certainly am. If my attorney was really working for Mr. Atwood, to save his life, then why is he dead? At what point was the Pony Express supposed to ride in with the life- saving medication?
(A BEAT): Or, did the Pony decide that he should be running his own Pony show? Minus the dog. Tan Coat stares at him, his face without expression.
REUBEN: ...actually, no, there's no more tickets. --Yeah, I know, an overbooked fundraiser -- there's a first -- well, here he comes, I'll ask him -- Edward!! We see Eddie striding down the corridor, wearing a sharp suit, looking more dignified than we've ever seen him, more adult. The snap and crackle of something new -- power -- is in his step. TWO MALE AIDES flank him. Reuben approaches, falls into step with them.
REUBEN (CONT'D): I think we're looking at a second, overflow event-- there's a wave of donations coming in -- and I don't think they're even going to try a second debate -- don't go yet --
EDDIE: I have a lunch. They have arrived at Eddie's office. Reuben nods at the closed door.
REUBEN: John Steadman's in there.
EDDIE: Who's that?
REUBEN: --Eiben-Chemcorps? Look, they're your biggest contributor, give him his two shitty little minutes. Eddie sighs, capitulating. Puts his hand on the door.
EDDIE: Eiben-Chemcorps. What are they -- research?
REUBEN: Pharmaceuticals. Eddie shoots him a look.
STEADMAN: Mr. Morgan.
EDDIE: Nice to see you. He shakes Steadman's hand, but Steadman doesn't get up. Odd. In fact Steadman looks uncommonly relaxed, almost slouched in his chair, looking up at Eddie with a subtle gleam in his eye that Eddie doesn't recognize.
EDDIE (CONT'D): We appreciate everything you've done for us--
STEADMAN: Well, you've done most of it for yourself. Senator Morgan. He says this with a kind of casual, prescient authority. And suddenly, we know he's right. Eddie will win.
STEADMAN (CONT'D): I mean, everything from here's a technicality, isn't it, Eddie? Again, that smile. Eddie doesn't know what this guy is about. And nobody calls him "Eddie" any more.
STEADMAN (CONT'D): I think we both know where it's heading...
(A BEAT): If... you can maintain.
EDDIE: Maintain?
STEADMAN: Eventually you'll run out. I just want you to know we're here to help you. Eddie blinks at him. Did he just say what Eddie thought he said?
EDDIE: What are you saying?
STEADMAN: We've gotten most of the bugs out. It's longer lasting - you'll only have to take one a week. Eddie is now dead silent. A long beat. Is it possible? Is he really talking to someone who makes MDT?!
EDDIE: Have you been watching me from the beginning?
STEADMAN: No. Those of you who indulged... distinguished yourselves very quickly. You made yourselves clear to us.
EDDIE: Who's "us?" Steadman just smiles, waves the question away.
STEADMAN: You went the furthest with it the fastest, so of course, to us, you're the most interesting.
EDDIE: How did it get on the street?
STEADMAN: Security breach. That was never our intention. We took care of it. Meaning, they took care of Vern.
STEADMAN (CONT'D): It will never again be on the street. It will never publicly exist. Obviously I don't need to detail the advantages for you. A long beat. Eddie doesn't trust this guy -- not a bit.
EDDIE: And what about for you? Why don't you take it?
STEADMAN: We don't have to. You'll take it for us.
EDDIE: And in return...? I do what.
STEADMAN: Just keep on doing what you're doing. We won't bother you much at first.
EDDIE: And later...? What will you be "bothering" me with?
STEADMAN: Well, given where you're heading, some of our ideas are... grandiose. But, I think, achievable. Eddie takes that in.
EDDIE: And if I don't like your ideas?
STEADMAN: Then we'll say Godspeed. And your candle will have shed a brief, but lovely, light. Eddie knows now. They own his ass.
STEADMAN (CONT'D): But let's not even go there. Right now you should feel relieved, your problems are over. We just want to keep you healthy... and brilliant.
EDDIE: Luckily I can do that myself.
STEADMAN: Well, no, ah, that won't be the case. We shut your lab down this morning.
EDDIE: My lab? Steadman nods.
EDDIE (CONT'D): Which one? Steadman doesn't blink.
STEADMAN: All of them.
EDDIE: You sure? Steadman suddenly chuckles -- not at all concerned by this. Even amused.
STEADMAN: We were right about you Eddie - you're gonna go all the way. Let's not do anything to jeopardize that. There's no downside here - we're offering you a limitless supply with fewer side effects. I think you'll be pleased with the arrangement.
(BEAT): Come on, let's get some lunch. I'm starving... He heads for the door. Eddie remains still.
EDDIE: Tell me something. Steadman stops, looks back at him.
EDDIE (CONT'D): Did I kill that woman? Steadman looks puzzled that Eddie would ask.
STEADMAN: Do you really want to know? Eddie thinks. No, he doesn't.
STEADMAN: It's not so bad, is it? Eddie doesn't answer.
STEADMAN (CONT'D): Doesn't every man on the path to greatness have to tolerate the wind- drag of compromise? A black LIMO waits at the curb.
STEADMAN (CONT'D): Overall, we'll all be better off... foreign policy, the courts, even the Constitution could stand a little tweaking... They descend the last few steps. Steadman opens the limo door for Eddie... But Eddie hesitates. Doesn't get in.
STEADMAN (CONT'D): Eddie?
EDDIE: After you.
STEADMAN: No, "Senator". You first. Eddie gestures for him to get in.
EDDIE: Please.
STEADMAN: All right then... He gets in. And Eddie CLOSES THE DOOR AFTER HIM. Stands outside the limo, looking back at Steadman through the rolled- down window, his face a cold mask.
STEADMAN (CONT'D): Oh, now. Don't underestimate us.
EDDIE: Don't underestimate your own creation. Steadman looks at him quizically.
EDDIE (CONT'D): I mean, you invented it. What does it do? It puts me 50 steps ahead of you fucks.
(CONTINUED): You think I didn't spend my days on MDT devising a personal defense structure that would scare the shit out of the Israelis--? You think there's not people with a bead on you right now, right in this building? You think this conversation is private?
STEADMAN: You don't know the caliber of enemies you'll be making.
EDDIE: You want to push that button? I'll show you my silos if you show me yours.
STEADMAN: You'll run out. You'll die.
EDDIE: Or I'll think of something. Isn't that what MDT does? Makes you think of something? Might even tell me how to get off it. A flicker in Steadman's eyes. Anger.
EDDIE (CONT'D): What if I just ask the drug... how to tell the drug... how to fuck itself? I mean, isn't it like the 8-ball? Steadman raises his hand to the driver and the limo pulls away.
EDDIE (CONT'D): It always answers. As the limo recedes into the distance, Eddie finally exhales. And only then do we see it. He's scared.
