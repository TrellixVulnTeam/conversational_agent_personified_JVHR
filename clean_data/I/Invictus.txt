INVICTUS: (aka "The Human Factor") Written by Anthony Peckham Based on material by JOHN CARLIN
COACH: It's that terrorist, Mandela. They let him out.
(BEAT): Remember this day, boys. It's the day our country went to the dogs.
CUT TO:: A short, STOCK-FOOTAGE MONTAGE which spans the tumultuous four years between NELSON MANDELA'S release from prison and his inauguration as President of South Africa. Footage would include: - Mandela's release from prison - negotiations with the apartheid regime - scenes of white fear and emigration - the horrifying sectarian violence leading up to the
ELECTIONS: - the khaki-clad AWB (Afrikaner right wing) attack on the World Trade Center (where negotiations were taking place) - the lifting of economic sanctions and cultural boycotts - the lifting of the international ban on the Springbok rugby team and immediate Test match losses to New Zealand and Australia. - popular black leader Chris Hani's assassination by white
RIGHT WINGERS: - black retaliation - Mandela's frantic intervention to keep the country from going up in flames - the election itself, with those incredible images of thousands and thousands of people, black and white, lining up patiently, some to vote for the first time in their lives - the African National Congress victory - Mandela's inauguration as President, where he delivers the
FAMOUS WORDS:: "Never, never and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will again experience the oppression of one by another, and suffer the indignity of being the skunk of the world." As APPLAUSE FADES ...
LINGA: Here he comes. Like clockwork.
JASON: It makes him such an easy target.
JASON: (traditional greeting in
XHOSA): I see you, father. Mandela's face comes alive as he smiles.
MANDELA: (without breaking stride) Morning boys. How are you? Jason is Mandela's head of personal security, Linga his number one bodyguard. They are both former "terrorists", and they are utterly devoted to Mandela.
JASON: We're sharp, Madiba.
MANDELA: Good ... good. And how's your mother doing, Linga?
LINGA: She's much better, thank you.
MANDELA: Good. Mandela picks up the pace. Jason and Linga fall back, so that they are a few steps behind him. They share a quick look. They hate this walk. It scares them. There's no way for it to be anything but completely unsanitary, from a security point of view.
CUT TO:: ANOTHER ANGLE of the shops as the small van turns onto the street with a squeal of tires.
CUT TO:: The SLIDING DOOR on the van IS OPENED from inside. Too dark to see in. Ominous.
CUT TO:: Mandela, Jason and Linga pass a HUGE POSTER OF MANDELA in the window of CORNER GROCERY. Mandela does not react to this giant picture of himself, Jason and Linga do, proudly -- (A GENERAL NOTE: starting with the window of this grocery, there are pictures of Mandela everywhere. Magazine covers, newspaper centerfolds, T-shirts, children's art -- as if to make up for all the time Mandela's image and words were banned.) -- until they HEAR THE SOUND OF THE VAN tearing towards them. They turn, SEE HEADLIGHTS VEERING TO THEIR SIDE OF THE
JASON: What does it say?
MANDELA: It says, "He can win an election, but can he run a country?"
LINGA: Not even one day on the job and they're after you.
MANDELA: It's a legitimate question. Mandela turns and marches for home. Jason and Linga fall in behind him. In the east, the first milky hint of day.
CUT TO:: MANDELA SHAVES UPSTAIRS IN THE BATHROOM. The razor is dull. Mandela opens drawers looking for another. He opens a drawer that is empty but for a WOMAN'S BEADED BRACELET, broken and shedding tiny colored beads. Mandela looks for it for a moment, then closes the drawer, looks at himself in the mirror. Mostly, Mandela's face is warm, animated, energetic and this is how we see him, almost all the time. But, sometimes, his face can be a remote, sphinx-like mask that conceals all emotion, all feeling. This is his prison face. This is the face that looks back at Mandela, right now, in the mirror. It is the face of a man whose long, hard journey has marked his very soul. Expressionless, Mandela shaves himself with the dull razor. OVER, a COCK CROWS and --
CUT TO:: -- a QUICK SERIES OF SHOTS, as the RAINBOW NATION WAKES UP.
TV ANNOUNCER: -- with white fears. Click! The TV is turned off by MR. PIENAAR (late 40's) in his very modest, blue-collar house.
PIENAAR: Thanks, ma.
JASON: (with great pride) After you, Mr. President.
MANDELA: Good morning everybody.
ALL: BARBARA MASEKELA, Mandela's CHIEF OF STAFF (and now Ambassador to the U.S.), emerges from her office, carrying an arm load of files, folders and papers --
MANDELA: Barbara, good morning. You've had your hair done. I like it. -- accompanies Mandela back towards his office.
BARBARA: Thank you, Madiba. We need to talk about your cabinet appointments and ministers.
MANDELA: Give me one moment, please. Barbara waits outside Mandela's office, as he enters ahead of her.
MANDELA: Barbara enters.
MANDELA: -- please assemble the staff for me. Whoever has not already left.
BARBARA: Right now? All of them?
MANDELA: Yes, please.
STAFF MEMBER#1: Here he comes.
STAFF MEMBER#2: He wants the satisfaction of firing us himself. They stand up straight, determined to receive the ax with pride.
MANDELA: I'd like you to stay out here, please.
JASON: But, Madiba ...
MANDELA: I cannot talk to them if I'm hiding behind men with guns. Mandela opens the doors and enters. Jason and Linga stay outside ... just.
MANDELA: Gooie more almal.
STAFF MEMBER: Does he think greeting us in Afrikaans makes this any sweeter?
MANDELA: Some of you may know who I am. This gets a few bitter chuckles. Mandela is at this best just talking to people, like this. Only, he doesn't just talk to them, he wades in amongst them, shaking hands and making individual contact as he speaks to all of them.
MANDELA: Good morning ... how are you ... thank you for coming at such short notice ... etc.
BACK TO:: When Mandela reaches the middle of the room, he stops shaking hands, and turns slowly as he talks to everybody.
MANDELA: I couldn't help noticing the empty offices as I came to work today. And all the packing boxes. One black man, surrounded by a throng of serious white faces.
MANDELA: Now, of course, if you want to leave, that is your right. And if you feel in your heart that you cannot work with your new government, then it is better that you do leave, right away. He can be tough and blunt, when necessary.
MANDELA: But if you are packing up because you fear that your language, or the color of your skin, or who you served previously, disqualifies you from working here now, I am here to tell you, have no such fear.
(BEAT): Wat is verby is verby. What's past is past. We look to the future, now. This is not what they expected to hear.
MANDELA: We need your help. We want your help. If you would like to stay, you will be doing your country a great service. Mandela pauses, to look at the faces. They are receptive.
MANDELA: I ask only that you do your jobs to the best of your abilities, and with good hearts. I promise to do the same.
(BEAT): If we can manage that, our country will be a shining light in the world.
CUT TO:: Jason and Linga are right outside the glass doors, looking in and listening. Jason shakes his head.
JASON: He wants to win them over, one damn boer at a time.
JASON: Molo, sister.
JESSIE: It's still morning? Jason grins.
JASON: When you get a chance, can we see the schedule for the month? We need to plan security. Jessie's phone rings.
JESSIE: Office of the President, good morning. Jessie waves Jason off. He crosses to the security office, enters.
JASON: We need more men.
LINGA: Did you talk to Barbara about it?
JASON: Yesterday.
JASON: That's Jessie, with the schedule.
(LOUDLY): Come in, beautiful. The door opens -- but what enters is not beautiful. FOUR BIG WHITE COPS in suits enter, Special Branch written all over them. ETIENNE VAN ECK, HENDRICK BOOYENS, GEORGE and
JASON: What is this?
ETIENNE: Mr. Jason Tshabalala?
JASON: That's me. Am I under arrest? Etienne snaps out a crisp salute.
ETIENNE: Captain Van Eck and team reporting for duty, sir. Hendrick, George and Willem snap out salutes. Their military deportment contrasts strongly with the less rigid body language of the black bodyguards.
JASON: What duty?
ETIENNE: We're the Presidential bodyguard. We've been assigned to this office. (holding out a sheet of
PAPER): Here are our orders. Jason takes the orders, studies them, face increasingly angry.
LINGA: You're Special Branch, right?
ETIENNE: You'll see that they've been signed.
JASON: I don't care if they're signed or -- Jason does a double-take when he sees the signature on the orders: NELSON R. MANDELA.
JASON: Wait here. Jason storms out, holding the orders. The four black bodyguards seethe with hostility. The four white bodyguards stare straight ahead, refusing to give ground.
JASON: Sorry to disturb you.
MANDELA: You look agitated, Jason.
JASON: That's because I've got four Special Branch cops in my office.
MANDELA: What have you done?
JASON: Me? Nothing. They say they're the Presidential bodyguard. They have orders.
(BEAT): Signed by you.
MANDELA: Yes. They've had special training, those boys -- with the SAS. And lots of experience. They protected De Klerk.
JASON: Yes, but --
MANDELA: You asked for more men, didn't you?
JASON: Yes, but --
MANDELA: In public, when people see me, they see my bodyguards, too. You represent me, directly. The rainbow nation starts here.
(BEAT): Reconciliation starts here.
JASON: Reconciliation? Madiba, not long ago they tried to kill us! Maybe even these four guys. They tried and, often, they succeeded!
MANDELA: Yes, I know.
(VERY GENTLY): Forgiveness starts here, too. Mandela lets that sink in for a moment. He knows he asks for something very difficult, but he demands it of himself to an even greater degree.
MANDELA: Forgiveness liberates the soul. It removes fear. That is why it is such a powerful weapon, Jason.
MANDELA (CONT'D): Please try it. Jason exhales. He isn't remotely ready to forgive.
JASON: Yes, Madiba. Sorry to disturb you. Jason turns, leaves. Barbara shakes her head at Mandela.
BARBARA: You ask a lot.
MANDELA: Only what is necessary.
JESSIE: Two copies of the schedule. Jason snatches the file, keeps walking.
JESSIE: Thank you, Jessie! When he reaches the security office door, Jason walks right past, keeps going, has to make a full loop of the reception area, just to get himself together. Even so, when he gets back to the security office door, Jason pauses, gathers himself to do something that he knows he's going to hate.
LINGA: Can we get rid of these guys, now? Jason flashes a look at Linga, then -- and this hurts him, visibly -- he holds out one of MANDELA'S SCHEDULES to Etienne.
JASON: This is his schedule for the next month. Let's look it over for duty assignments.
ETIENNE: Right.
LINGA: What? Linga and the others are shocked.
LINGA: Jason, I have to talk to you. Outside. Linga virtually pulls Jason out of the office.
LINGA: How can we trust them?
JASON: We can't. (heading back in) This is what Madiba wants, okay. Not okay for Linga, judging by the expression on his face.
ETIENNE: Are there any special orders or conditions?
JASON: No. Yes. Madiba gets upset if you don't smile when you push people out of the way.
HENDRICK: Seriously?
LINGA: Yes, seriously. It's the new South Africa.
ETIENNE: Madiba?
JASON: The President's clan name. It's what we call him. The new bodyguards share a look. They're not comfortable with "Madiba".
ETIENNE: We'll call him Mr. President. Jason lifts the schedule.
JASON: Let's get through this. Still upset and hostile, the black bodyguards look over Jason's shoulder, the white bodyguards look over Etienne's, at the month's schedule. Apartheid is by no means dead in this cramped little office. Both teams study and discuss the schedule -- (shop talk tbd
ETIENNE: How's he going to do all this? When does he take a break?
LINGA: He says he rested enough in prison. Jason recoils at something he sees on the last page of the schedule.
JASON: Here's a headache.
LINGA: What?
JASON: A rugby match at Loftus Versfeld. British Lions against the Springboks.
HENDRICK: It's going to be a headache for the Lions, that's for sure. We're going to donder them.
JASON: I don't care about the game. I care that the President'll be so exposed.
LINGA: To thousands of drunken --
ETIENNE: -- sports fans?
JASON: Yes. Sports fans.
LINGA: Who didn't vote for him. Who probably hate him. Who came out of the womb with guns in their hands.
JASON: (shouting against the
NOISE): I want your eyes on the crowd at all times. We're staying in the middle of the field. He's going to walk out, shake hands, walk back. Nothing else. Got it? They nod. They are like the players at game time, only the stakes are much higher. Jason looks deeper into the tunnel, straightens up.
JASON: Here we go. Mandela strides down the tunnel towards them, wearing a dark suit. Big crowds energize him. His eyes are alive with excitement. One pace behind him, like a huge, dark shadow, comes Linga. Mandela gives Jason a look, Jason nods. We follow Mandela and the bodyguards out of the tunnel --
MANDELA: Good luck, captain.
PIENAAR: Thank you, sir. Mandela shakes hands down the line of Springboks, then returns, shaking hands with the British Lions. Quick, perfunctory handshakes. As Mandela does this, we take BODYGUARD POV SNAPSHOTS of the crowd, increasingly keyed-up and restless. Time to play rugby. Mandela finishes, waves to the crowd, and begins the walk along the center of the field, back to the tunnel. Crowd noise increases. They know the opening whistle is about to blow. Then, Mandela sees something in the crowd, at field level.
JASON: Stay with him.
ETIENNE: Stop him.
JASON: Stay with him.
MANDELA: Thank you for honoring our new flag! Some shake his hand, some -- very pointedly -- do not. The crowd noise takes on an ugly undertone -- Mandela is delaying the rugby. Mandela is undeterred. He's into this one-on-one outreach. He turns, looks for more hands to shake -- -- and Jason steps in between Mandela and the crowd.
JASON: We're delaying the rugby, Madiba.
MANDELA: Oh, yes, of course. Mandela gives one last wave, turns away. As he does, SOMEONE WINDS UP AND THROWS SOMETHING from the stands. Jason and Etienne catch the movement, whirl, too late. AN ORANGE WHIZZES PAST MANDELA'S HEAD, explodes juicily on the field. Mandela didn't see it, doesn't react. If anything, his smile widens as he heads across the field. The bodyguards close around him protectively, get him back to the tunnel.
ETIENNE: Why didn't you stop him?
JASON: Next time, you try.
ETIENNE: Does he do that sort of thing all the time?
JASON: Ask my ulcer.
(BEAT): Good thing that was just an orange.
ETIENNE: And good thing he never saw it.
JASON: Oh, he saw it. He sees everything. (rubbing his ulcer) I hate rugby.
PIENAAR: Concentrate, dammit! Focus! We can beat these guys if we play our game, not theirs! ON PIENAAR, as he realizes he is not getting through. There is dullness, shock in his player's eyes -- -- which all lift to the heavens as the CONVERSION KICK SOARS through the uprights. We FOLLOW THE KICK as it drops past a GIANT SCOREBOARD. STAY ON THE SCOREBOARD as it registers the conversion and shows the score: LIONS - 10 SPRINGBOKS - 0
MANDELA: Shall we work while we watch? We have lots of promises to keep. Barbara sits to his right, with her ever-present files and folders.
BARBARA: Yes, we do. Mary pours tea at the back of the box. Linga stands two steps behind Mandela. On Mandela's left, sits the PRESIDENT OF SOUTH AFRICAN RUGBY, a small man with a small man's ruthlessness and drive.
MANDELA: It's not too late, if the boys can just pick up their game.
RUGBY PRESIDENT: If they don't, heads will roll. This is unacceptable.
(LEANING FORWARD): Come on you bloody bastards!
BARBARA: Where do you want go first, for foreign investment?
MANDELA: Where the money is. America, England, Saudi Arabia. Barbara makes notes. Mandela lifts his BINOCULARS, but instead of looking at the rugby, he looks at the crowd.
CUT TO:: MANDELA'S POV THROUGH BINOCULARS -- Mandela zeroes in on an OLD SOUTH AFRICAN FLAG -- the apartheid flag. It is being held by the FOUR KHAKI-CLAD BOERS (FARMERS). Classic South African figures from the rural far north, they are already drunk and suicidally depressed by the turn of events on the field.
BARBARA: Do you see all the old apartheid flags? It's a disgrace. Mandela lowers his binoculars.
MANDELA: It's also a constitutional right.
BARBARA: Along with the apartheid anthem. I know. But it's time people moved on. Mandela grunts, raises his binoculars again.
CUT TO:: MANDELA'S POV THROUGH BINOCULARS -- Mandela finds a SMALL KNOT OF BLACK SPECTATORS, holding the NEW SOUTH AFRICAN FLAG and cheering ecstatically.
MANDELA: Look at that. The whites are cheering for the Springboks, the blacks are cheering for the Lions. Mandela lowers the binoculars.
MANDELA: We did that on the island, you know. We supported anyone but the `boks. It really irritated the warders.
BARBARA: Of course it did. ON MANDELA as he thinks about this for a moment, then lifts his binoculars to look at the crowd again.
CUT TO:: MANDELA'S POV THROUGH BINOCULARS -- on the knot of black spectators, who leap to their feet, reacting to ACTION ON THE
CUT TO:: The conversion sails over the `boks heads. The scoreboard clicks over to: LIONS - 20 SPRINGBOKS - O
MANDELA: How long until the World Cup?
RUGBY PRESIDENT: About a year.
MANDELA: Plenty of time for improvement.
RUGBY PRESIDENT: Mr. President -- I wouldn't get my hopes up. We're a damn disgrace. He stomps out of the box, no doubt looking for someone to fire. Mandela gets back to work.
MANDELA: I want to go to India and Indonesia, too. There is a knock at the luxury box door. Linga swings to face the door, alert, as a UNIFORMED DOORMAN opens it. The MINISTER OF SPORT (Steve Tshwete), enters.
MANDELA: Very badly. The Minister of Sport checks the score, winces.
MANDELA: Why?
QUIETLY): I've just been at a meeting of the National Sports Council executive. There's strong support to drop the Springbok emblem and colors altogether. (gesturing at the field) If they're playing badly, maybe its a good time to make a change. (with barely hidden
RELISH): MINISTER OF SPORT (cont'd) This could be the last time we have to look at the green and gold. The Minister of Sport shoots a glance at Mandela, to see his reaction to all this. Mandela is deep in thought and completely unreadable.
BOLAND BOTHA: They left 80 minutes later with their tails between their legs, like whipped mongrels.
(BEAT): And I, for one, am glad. Not because we lost, but because there's now no way to disguise the fact that we are completely and utterly unprepared to reenter the world of top-notch international rugby. Boland defines the South African talent for pessimism and negativity.
RUGBY PRESIDENT: Who gets the axe? Someone has to.
PIENAAR: He's trying to get them to drop me.
NERINE: He's just bitter because the Springboks were boycotted when he played.
PIENAAR: Maybe, but people listen to what he says.
MARY: Here's your muti. I warmed the milk tonight.
MANDELA: You're too good to me. Mandela takes his pills.
MARY: Your daughter called, to cancel her visit this weekend.
MANDELA: Did she say why?
MARY: No, she didn't. (making it up) She said to tell you she was sorry. Mandela nods, has a hard time swallowing his last pill.
MARY: Do you need anything else tonight?
MANDELA: No, thank you. I'm going to bed. Good night.
MARY: Good night, Madiba. Sleep well. Mandela smiles at her, but as soon as he is past her, the smile fades. As he climbs the stairs to his bedroom, his face becomes sadder and older and lonelier. IN HIS BEDROOM, Mandela pauses to take off his dressing gown. He looks at his bed. It is as smooth and as blank as a sheet of paper. He peels back the bedclothes at one corner, slides under them and pauses for a moment while reaching for the light switch. He switches off the light and lies down, still and straight. The most popular man in the world starts and ends each day alone.
NSC FIREBRAND: ... and now for the next item on our agenda. The hall is jammed. Very few white faces.
NSC FIREBRAND: The NSC executive proposes a full membership vote on the following motion ... A ripple of anticipation goes through the delegates.
NSC FIREBRAND: ... that as a prominent symbol of the apartheid era, the colors, emblem and name of the Springboks be eliminated immediately ... That causes a stir. The delegates understand how big this is.
NSC FIREBRAND: ... and that all sports teams representing South Africa shall be known forthwith as the Proteas. Excitement and noise level rises. The NSC Firebrand has to shout through his mike.
NSC FIREBRAND: We will submit this motion to a hand vote.
(MORE): NSC FIREBRAND (cont'd) In the event of a close count, we will go to a written ballot. (the moment he's been
WAITING FOR): The NSC firebrand shoots his clenched fist into the air. With a roar, the delegates respond, raising their fists. Unanimous. The Springboks are history. ANOTHER ANGLE, as ONE OF THE OLDER DELEGATES steps outside to make a call.
JASON: Both units to the cars, right now.
BARBARA: What do I tell the Japanese trade delegation?
MANDELA: I delegate that decision to you.
BARBARA: Do you want me to inform the VP?
MANDELA: No.
BARBARA: We should at least include the Minister of Sport.
MANDELA: No. Mandela heads out to the cars. Barbara has no choice but to follow.
BARBARA: I strongly advise against doing this. Especially on your own. It ... it gives the impression of autocratic leadership.
BARBARA: You risk alienating your cabinet and your party.
MANDELA: Your advice is duly noted, Barbara.
BARBARA: Madiba ... the people want this. They hate the Springboks. They don't want to be represented by a team they cheered against all their lives.
MANDELA: Yes, I know. But in this instance the people are wrong. And it is my job as their elected leader to make them see that. Mandela leans forward to talk to Linga.
MANDELA: Can you tell the boys that Madiba wants to go to Eersterust, very fast. Linga murmurs into his radio. The convoy pulls out, very fast. Barbara makes one last plea.
BARBARA: You're risking your political capital. You're risking your future as our leader.
MANDELA: The day I am afraid to do that is the day I am no longer fit to lead.
BARBARA: At least risk it for something more important than rugby. Mandela looks out the window, says nothing, angry.
NSC FIREBRAND: ... brothers, sisters, comrades, we in the executive applaud your diligence and courage. The NSC Firebrand and the executive applaud the members. The applause spreads until the hall rocks. They are all very pleased with themselves.
NSC FIREBRAND: Brothers, sisters ... join us in our anthem. Anyone not standing, stands. The choir director raises his hands. The choir inhales. Go.
CHOIR: Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrica etc (God Bless Africa) -- But before the first line is fully sung, an ASSISTANT rushes out, whispers urgently into the NSC Firebrand's ear.
NSC FIREBRAND: Brothers, sisters, members of the choir -- we would only interrupt such beautiful music for something truly important. In this case, for someone truly important. (beat, milking it) Please welcome President Mandela! The place goes berserk as Mandela enters, with Linga at his back, and -- surprise, surprise -- Hendrick Booyens leading the way. Face stern and unsmiling, Mandela walks the length of the hall towards the podium. The delegates press in towards them. ANOTHER ANGLE - Jason coordinates security inside and out. Lifts his radio to his mouth.
JASON: Smile. ON HENDRICK, as his standard bad bastard scowl suddenly becomes a smile -- which scares the throng more than the scowl did. ON LINGA, the same. ANOTHER ANGLE - Barbara enters at the back of the hall, accompanied by Kwezi. Mandela reaches the podium, turns looks out over the crowd, face thunderous. When they see his anger, the crowd quietens down quickly.
MANDELA: Brothers, sisters, comrades, I am here because I feel strongly that you made a decision today without sufficient information or foresight. He lectures them like a headmaster. They don't like it.
MANDELA: I am aware of your earlier vote. I am aware that it was unanimous.
(BEAT): Nonetheless, I propose that we restore the Springboks. Restore their name, their emblem and their colors, immediately. Instant and complete silence in the hall. This is utterly unpopular. Shocked faces, especially from the executive and the NSC firebrand. ON BARBARA, as she sees her worst political nightmare playing out in front of her.
MANDELA: Let me tell you why ... Murmurs of disapproval and disagreement begin to rise. Mandela's going to have to row upstream on this one.
MANDELA: ... on Robben Island, in Pollsmoor Prison, my jailers were all Afrikaners.
(BEAT): For twenty seven years, I studied them. I learned their language, I read their history, I read their poetry. I had to know my enemy, in order to prevail against him.
(BEAT): And we prevailed, did we not? All of us here ... we prevailed. For the first time, Mandela says something the crowd likes.
MANDELA: Our enemy is no longer the Afrikaner. They are our fellow South Africans, our partners in democracy. Just as quickly, Mandela loses them again.
MANDELA: And they treasure Springbok rugby. If we take that away, we lose them. We prove that we are what they feared we would be.
(BEAT): We have to be better than that.
MANDELA (CONT'D): We have to surprise them with compassion, with restraint, and generosity. The grumbling and disagreement becomes noticeably louder.
MANDELA: Yes, I know. All the things they denied us. ON HENDRICK, totally engrossed in his job, eyes sweeping across the crowd, feeling the tension.
MANDELA: But this is not the time to enjoy a moment's petty revenge. This is the time to build our nation using every single brick available to us - - even if that brick comes clothed in green and gold. The crowd is growing more restless and rebellious by the moment. LINGA is as alert as Hendrick, tuned in to the jumpy vibe.
MANDELA: You elected me.
(BEAT): You elected me to be your leader. Let me lead you now.
(BEAT): Who is with me on this? It's almost as if he's daring them to go against him.
MANDELA: Who is with me? The murmuring becomes a dull roar of argument and disagreement. ON BARBARA as she closes her eyes and lowers her head: this is a fiasco.
BARBARA: Twelve votes. Twelve!
MANDELA: A luxury. All we needed was one more yes than no.
BARBARA: What if you hadn't got it?
MANDELA: Well, as you know, I am an obedient party member. Barbara snorts disagreement. She is angry at her boss.
BARBARA: I'm sorry, Madiba, but we've got problems everywhere we look. Housing, food, jobs, crime, our currency. You can't keep interrupting affairs of state to placate a minority.
MANDELA: But, I must. This minority still controls the army, the police, and the economy. Without them, we cannot address the other problems.
BARBARA: So this rugby, it's just a political calculation? Life and energy, flood back into Mandela. He sits up against his seat belt, faces his Chief of Staff.
MANDELA: It's a human calculation.
(BEAT): If we take away what they cherish -- the Springboks, their national anthem -- we just reinforce the cycle of fear between us. ON LINGA, in the front seat. He's not supposed to listen -- but how could he not?
MANDELA: I will do what I must to break this cycle. Or it will destroy us.
ANGRY SPRINGBOK: This beer tastes like kuk. -- hurls the beer against the wall so hard it ruptures, sending foaming beer everywhere. ON PIENAAR as his eyes flash and he shoots to his feet.
PIENAAR: It's not the beer. Pienaar picks up a case of beers, goes to the angry Springbok.
PIENAAR: Take another.
(BEAT): Everybody take a beer. This is an order. The entire team takes a beer, including Pienaar.
PIENAAR: A toast ... Pienaar cracks his beer, raises it up. They all crack and raise their beers.
PIENAAR: ... to the taste of defeat. That bewilders his team.
PIENAAR: Drink it. Remember it. And promise yourself never to taste it again. Pienaar takes one long swig --
PIENAAR: You're right. It tastes like kuk. -- tosses his beer against the wall, so that it ruptures. Eighteen other beers rupture against the wall. The dressing room is awash with beer and foam -- and re-kindled passion. As with Mandela, Pienaar is a leader, on a smaller scale.
JASON: Here's the schedule for the overseas trip. Jason and the boys look over one, Etienne and his unit look over the other -- and discuss it amongst themselves in Afrikaans. Hendrick says something pointed, which resonates with the others.
LINGA: What did he just say?
HENDRICK: I said --
ETIENNE: He asked when we were supposed to sleep.
HENDRICK: As well as other basic human functions.
JASON: Hey. If Madiba can do it, we can do it.
MANDELA: The millions of our people say thank you, and thank you again. Linga and Hendrick are his closest bodyguards.
MANDELA: I have come here with a message. People of the Unites States of America: Open your markets to us. People of the United States of American: Come and invest in our country. Linga, Jason, Etienne and Hendrick are in on this one -- a little island of South Africans in a sea of U.S. SECRET
TV ANNOUNCER: -- as he concluded a gruelling trip
TO--: Mr. Pienaar MUTES THE TV, so that he can deliver the latest one-liner to Mrs. Pienaar.
CUT TO:: Mandela disembarks, very slowly. He is exhausted, his feet are swollen, his knee hurts. This is a very different man than the one we have just seen wooing the world. He is met at the bottom of the stairs by Hendrick.
HENDRICK: It's good to be home, sir. Mandela just nods. Too tired to talk. Hendrick escorts Mandela to the Mercedes, opens the door for him. Mandela takes a step towards the open door -- and staggers. Reflexively, Hendrick reaches out, steadies him.
MANDELA: I'm fine. Mandela steps out of Hendrick's hands, holds onto the open door.
MANDELA: Travelling the world, begging for money, is very tiring. Mandela reaches into his jacket, pulls a SMALL PACKAGE out, hands it to Hendrick.
MANDELA: This is for you. Mandela slides into the car. Once the door is closed, Hendrick glances at the package. We don't see it. It is too dark. But we do see that Hendrick is amazed by it.
LINGA: I see you, father.
MANDELA: Morning boys.
HENDRICK: Morning, sir. They keep moving. It is too cold for anything else.
MANDELA: How is your family, Hendrick?
HENDRICK: Top shape, sir. How about yours? Mandela's smile becomes fixed on his face.
MANDELA: I have a very big family. 42 million people. Then, he stops, turns, heads back towards the house.
MANDELA: I don't think I want to walk today. Hendrick realizes that he blundered, somehow. He shoots an anxious glance at Linga -- who looks at him as if he'd just committed blasphemy. Mandela goes through the open gate without a word. The gate closes behind him, leaving Linga and Hendrick to watch him through iron bars. Linga turns on Hendrick.
LINGA: We never ask him about his family.
HENDRICK: But he asks about ours all the time.
LINGA: Think about it, man. He's separated from his wife. His children ... how often do you see them here?
(BEAT): He's not a saint, okay. He's a man, with a man's problems -- and he doesn't need us reminding him about them. Linga heads back to his BMW. Hendrick stands at the gate, looking in at the house.
CUT TO:: Shaved, showered and dressed, Mandela descends the stairs, sits down to breakfast by himself at the big table. He looks at the newspaper headlines, which talk about CRIME RISING, THE RAND FALLING, THE MANDELA HONEYMOON OVER etc. etc. Like any other man, Mandela turns to the SPORTS SECTION for relief -- and finally finds something to smile about.
MANDELA: Hello Barbara. I like that dress.
BARBARA: Thank you Madiba.
(OFFERING ENVELOPE): This is for you.
MANDELA: What is it?
BARBARA: Your pay checks. You haven't been collecting them. Mandela opens the envelope, looks at a check -- and grunts.
BARBARA: What's wrong?
MANDELA: This is terrible.
BARBARA: Madiba, it's what De Klerk got. Plus an increase for inflation. But, Mandela shakes his head, outraged.
TV ANNOUNCER: (on TV throughout) -- his salary is too high. Pienaar and Nerine watch the news with MR. AND MRS PIENAAR.
TV ANNOUNCER: He has therefore decided to donate a third of his monthly income to charity.
PIENAAR: (to Mr. Pienaar) You would not. Not in a million years.
PIENAAR: Hallo, Pienaar. Whatever Pienaar hears on the phone sends him out of the room in a hurry.
PIENAAR: Hang on a moment, please.
TV ANNOUNCER: President Mandela said that he wished to set an example to other leaders and cabinet ministers.
NERINE: He knows I'd bloody kill him. ON EUNICE, as eyes and ears alive, she finishes in the kitchen. Pienaar comes back, stands in the doorway, a stunned expression on his face.
NERINE: What? Who was it? Pienaar doesn't answer immediately.
PIENAAR: I've been invited to tea.
NERINE: Who with?
PIENAAR: The President.
PIENAAR: The President. ON THE TV: footage of Mandela with a group of SAUDI PRINCES. Eunice turns and looks at Francois, wide-eyed.
PIENAAR: He wants me over for tea, week after next. Eunice picks up her handbag, puts on her coat and heads for the door, stops when she reaches Pienaar.
EUNICE: Mr. Francois -- you must tell Madiba that the bus service is very bad, and too expensive. He must please fix it.
(LEAVING): Good night everybody.
NERINE: Francois, relax. You've met him before.
PIENAAR: I shook his hand on the rugby field, that's all.
NERINE: You didn't even vote for him.
PIENAAR: He's still the President.
(CONFESSING): He's had dinner with the Queen. With Presidents and movie stars. All I do is play rugby. What if I pull something stupid in front of him? Nerine stops to let Pienaar out. Gives him a kiss, straightens his hair.
NERINE: You won't. I'll pick you up right here.
ETIENNE: See who's coming for tea?
HENDRICK: My nephew wants me to get his autograph.
LINGA: Who?
ETIENNE: Francois Pienaar.
JASON: Who wants to escort him in? Hendrick bolts for the door.
HENDRICK: I will.
JASON: No autographs.
HENDRICK: I know how to do my job, okay. Hendrick leaves.
LINGA: Who's this Pienaar?
ETIENNE: You can't be serious? He's the captain of the Springboks. Linga shrugs, provocatively indifferent.
LINGA: I like soccer, myself.
ETIENNE: Well, you know what they say about soccer -- it's gentleman's game played by hooligans. One the other hand, rugby is a hooligan's game played by --
LINGA: Ja, ja, I've heard it before. It wasn't funny the first time. Not exactly violin music and roses ... but they are talking to each other.
PIENAAR: Can I ask you a question, Lieutenant?
HENDRICK: Ja, of course.
PIENAAR: What's he like? They pause at the office door. Hendrick ponders that question for a moment, then:
HENDRICK: When I worked for the previous President, it was my job to be invisible. Hendrick opens the door.
HENDRICK: This President ... he found out I like English toffee and brought me some back, from his visit to the Queen. Hendrick ushers Pienaar into Mandela's offices.
HENDRICK: To him, nobody is invisible.
HENDRICK: That's where you wait. One of his assistants will come for you.
(POINTING): There's a bathroom over there, if you need it.
PIENAAR: Okay. Thanks. Hendrick turns to leave, hesitates, turns back.
HENDRICK: What are our chances in the World Cup? I mean, for real.
PIENAAR: We'll do our best. That, I can guarantee. Hendrick nods solemnly, heads back to security. Pienaar heads straight for the bathroom.
HENDRICK: Well, he's not as big as he looks on TV.
(BEAT): And we don't stand a bloody chance in the World Cup.
MARY: Mr. Pienaar? Pienaar shoots to his feet.
MARY: This way, please. Mary leads Pienaar back to Mandela's own office, knocks, opens the door.
MARY: Go on in. Mouth dry, Pienaar nods -- -- and enters the inner sanctum.
MANDELA: Francois, what an honor. I'm so excited. They shake hands.
MANDELA: Thank you for coming all this way to see me. Pienaar gulps like a fish out of water.
PIENAAR: Yes, sir. No problem. Thank you for inviting me.
MANDELA: Tell me. How's your ankle?
PIENAAR: My ankle?
MANDELA: I was told you'd hurt it. Has it healed? Pienaar relaxes, visibly. This is small talk he can handle. This is Mandela's gift.
PIENAAR: The truth is, sir, you never play at a hundred percent, no matter what.
MANDELA: Yes ... yes. In sports, and in life. Come. Sit. Please. (indicating a chair) Take this one. Looking into the light hurts my eyes. They sit in the chairs. A KNOCK at the door, and MRS. BRITS the old Afrikaner tea lady enters, carrying a laden tea tray. Mandela stands again, immediately.
MANDELA: Ah, Mrs. Brits -- Pienaar stands just a beat slower.
MANDELA: -- you are a shining light in my day.
MANDELA: Mrs. Brits, this is Francois Pienaar. He's the captain of the Springboks. Mandela clearly expects Pienaar to shake hands with Mrs. Brits. Pienaar holds out his hand --
PIENAAR: Aangename kennis, Mevrou Brits. -- gently shakes hers.
(TO MANDELA): Shall I pour, sir?
MANDELA: No thank you, I think I'd like to. Mrs. Brits leaves. Mandela does not sit until the door closes behind her. Pienaar only sits after he does. Mandela's manners would not be out of place in Victorian England.
MANDELA: How do you take your tea, Francois?
PIENAAR: Milk and sugar, please. Mandela pours tea for both of them. ON PIENAAR, as, just for a moment, he realizes that here he is, with the President pouring him a cup of tea.
MANDELA: The English have given us many things, including rugby, but afternoon tea is one of the greatest. Mandela hands Pienaar the tea cup.
PIENAAR: Thank you, sir. Both men have big hands. Fine china dwarfed and threatened. In the exact moment that both their hands hold the same saucer, Mandela looks Pienaar in the eye.
MANDELA: You have a very difficult job.
PIENAAR: I do? I sell gas braais. Mandela lets go and Pienaar takes the tea.
MANDELA: Captain of the Springboks. A very difficult job.
PIENAAR: Not compared to yours, sir.
MANDELA: Ah, but then nobody is trying to tear my head off while I'm doing mine. Pienaar grins. True.
MANDELA: It is not so difficult to get people to do their best. And I imagine that anybody who plays for their country does their best, almost automatically.
PIENAAR: Or they wouldn't be chosen in the first place.
MANDELA: Yes. But to get people to be better than that?
MANDELA (CONT'D): Better than they think they can be? Now, that is difficult, I find.
PIENAAR: Yes sir, it is.
MANDELA: How do we do that? By example? To an extent. But there is more to it than that ... (searching for the right
WORD): ... inspiration, perhaps. Pienaar is engrossed. This is a master lesson on leadership, from a master.
MANDELA: How do we inspire ourselves to greatness, when nothing less will do? How do we inspire everyone around us?
(BEAT): Sometimes, I think, by using the work of others. Long pause. Pienaar knows to keep quiet.
MANDELA: On Robben Island, when things were very hard, I found inspiration in a poem.
PIENAAR: A poem?
MANDELA: A Victorian poem. Just words. But they helped me to stand when all I wanted was to lie down --
(SUDDENLY DISMISSIVE): But you didn't come all this way to hear an old man talk about things that make no sense.
PIENAAR: No! They make a lot of sense, sir.
(BEAT): On the day of a big match, say a test, in the bus on the way to the stadium, nobody talks.
MANDELA: Yes ... yes. Everybody is preparing.
PIENAAR: When I think we're ready, I have the bus driver put on a song I've chosen; a theme song. One we all know. We listen together and ... it helps.
MANDELA: Yes! I remember when I was a guest at the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona. The whole stadium welcomed me with a song.
(BEAT): At the time the future -- our future -- seemed very bleak. But to hear that song, in voices from all over our planet ... it made me very proud to be South African. It helped me to come home and do better. It allowed me to expect more of myself. A beat.
PIENAAR: May I ask what the song was, sir?
MANDELA: Well, it was Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika. A very inspiring song. Mandela looks into Pienaar's eyes.
MANDELA: We need inspiration, Francois. Brown African eyes, blue African eyes meet over their cups of tea.
MANDELA: Because, in order to build our nation, we all need to exceed our own expectations. Something passes between them. Whatever it is has a profound impact on Pienaar.
PIENAAR: Yes, sir. We probably do.
CUT TO:: Cameras click and whirr as MANDELA AND PIENAAR SHAKE HANDS for the press. (NOTE that there are NO FLASHES.)
NERINE: So ...?
PIENAAR: Hm?
NERINE: What's he like?
PIENAAR: He's ...
(BEAT): ... he's not like anyone I've ever met before. An unsatisfying answer. Nerine waits for more. But, she isn't going to get it without prying it out of Pienaar.
NERINE: Well? What did he want? This is the question Pienaar is wrestling with, too. He thinks it over for long enough to drive Nerine crazy.
NERINE: Ag, come on Francois. It's like talking to a bloody brick wall. What did he want? Pienaar turns in his seat, looks at her as realization comes clear in him ...
PIENAAR: I think ...
(BEAT): I think he wants us to win the World Cup.
MANDELA: Excuse me. Mandela disentangles the babies, stands, leaves.
CUT TO:: In the DINING ROOM, Zindzi looks down at a BIG FRONT PAGE
MANDELA: What do you think?
ZINDZI: It doesn't matter what I think.
MANDELA: Yes, it does.
ZINDZI: Okay. I think he looks like one of the policemen who forced us out of our house when you were in jail. I don't like seeing you shake his hand. And I'm not the only one. Mandela overreacts.
MANDELA: You criticize without understanding. You seek only to address your own feelings. This is selfish thinking. It does not serve the nation. Zindzi shakes her head, turns, leaves.
MANDELA: Wait. Please. I -- Mandela wants to apologize, doesn't know how. Instead, he pulls AN ENVELOPE out of his pocket, holds it out.
MANDELA: Will you give this to your mother.
ZINDZI: What is it?
MANDELA: A bracelet. Zindzi looks into the envelope. In it is the BEADED BRACELET, from earlier, from the bathroom.
ZINDZI: Just throw it away.
MANDELA: I don't have the right to. It's not mine.
ZINDZI: If she left it here, she meant to throw it away. Only children know how to twist the dagger so deftly. Mandela turns away so that his daughter cannot see his eyes. A man so at ease with strangers does not know how to talk to his own family.
EUNICE: Mrs. Pienaar said you were finished with the paper.
MANDELA: The Ivory Coast qualified. This is wonderful. (For the record, the sixteen teams who qualified were: South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Canada, Romania, Italy, France, Japan, West Samoa, Argentina, Tonga and Ivory Coast.)
(MORE): MINISTER OF SPORT (cont'd) They're both clear favorites to reach the finals this time.
(BEAT): According to the experts, we'll reach the quarter finals, and no further.
MANDELA: According to the experts, you and I are still supposed to be in jail. That brings a grin from the Minister of Sport.
COACH: Again! ON PIENAAR, as he leaps to his feet, leads the charge back to the 25 m line.
(BEAT): The finals will be broadcast to over a billion people around the world, live.
MANDELA: A billion people watching us! (wheels turning in his
HEAD): Yes ... yes. This is a great opportunity.
SPRINGBOK MANAGER: I reckon you've knocked the stuffing out of them today.
COACH: I haven't even begun.
(BEAT): We may not be the most talented team in the world -- but we're going to be the fittest. He blows his whistle.
COACH: And back! The squad can't believe their ears. No one moves. Except Pienaar.
PIENAAR: Come on boys, let's show him. Staggering more than sprinting, Pienaar heads towards the 25m line.
SPRINGBOK FLANK: Shit, what's Pienaar been eating? But, they follow him.
MANDELA: Please call the head of South African rugby for me.
RUGBY PRESIDENT: Afternoon men. It's good to see you working so hard. I have a short announcement.
(BEAT): As part of the PR buildup to the World Cup, you will be conducting coaching clinics in townships all over the country. The players greet this announcement with complete silence.
RUGBY PRESIDENT: I know you have plenty on your plates already -- but this is a request that comes from the top. (looking at Pienaar,
POINTEDLY): The very top. The Rugby President turns on his heel, and leaves, followed by the Manager. The players say nothing for a long moment, but body language alone shows that they are completely disgusted.
SPRINGBOK HOOKER: This is complete crap.
SPRINGBOK FLANK: Are we some kind of circus act now?
SPRINGBOK LOCK: We don't have time for kuk like this. The boys are getting angrier by the second.
SPRINGBOK LOCK: They expect us to play our best, to give our bloody all, then they add to our bloody workload ... The lock turns to Chester.
SPRINGBOK LOCK: What do you think about this, Chester? All eyes on Chester, as if the poor guy is a magic guide to a world they barely understand.
CHESTER WILLIAMS: I try not to think. It interferes with my rugby. The perfect answer for these guys.
SPRINGBOK LOCK: See! Now there's a rugby player. Talk to them Francois.
SPRINGBOK WING: Make them see that this is a waste of time we don't have. All eyes on their Captain -- who shakes his head, no.
PIENAAR: I'm not going to talk to them.
SPRINGBOK FLANK: Why not?
PIENAAR: Whether we like it or not, we're more than just a rugby team. We're ... we're ambassadors inside our own country. And we might as well get used to it. Silence. Rebellious silence. Then:
SPRINGBOK LOCK: Is this you speaking, or Mandela?
PIENAAR: You know me better than that.
(BEAT): Times change. We need to change, too. It is clear that much of his team disagrees with him.
TV ANNOUNCER: No one has claimed responsibility yet, but authorities say that the timing and target mark this as the work of white, right-wing fanatics. An act of revenge for the FBI killings in Waco, Texas. Jason and Linga share a pointed look. South Africa is a global leader in white, right-wing fanatics.
TV ANNOUNCER: The explosive, a truck bomb, was apparently a simple mixture of commonly available industrial and agricultural materials.
JASON: That's all we need.
JASON (CONT'D): A homemade explosive from materials every boer already has. Then, Jason realizes that Mandela is standing right next to him.
TV ANNOUNCER: So far, the official death toll stands at over a 100 people, which includes at least 12 children from a day care center in the Federal building. Mandela turns to Barbara.
MANDELA: Please call President Clinton for me. I wish to offer him our condolences. Mandela turns to Jason, eyes deep and dark.
MANDELA: Do you see why forgiveness is essential, Jason?
(BEAT): Revenge only begets revenge. As Mandela walks back to his office, there is a look of utter sorrow on his face.
SPRINGBOK LOCK: Shit, I'm glad I don't live here.
SPRINGBOK HOOKER: What the hell are they doing? The driver sounds the horn again, and the kids on the field sprint for the bus, hands and pockets full of broken glass.
PIENAAR: Don't forget, we've got TV cameras on us at all times.
SPRINGBOK LOCK: What a bloody joke.
THAT --: -- until the bus door opens with a loud hiss of hydraulics and the Springboks exit, one by one. Pienaar first, with a huge NET BAG OF PRACTISE BALLS over his shoulder. The Springboks are all so big, so strong, so healthy, they look like gods, or aliens, emerging from a spaceship. The kids go quiet, awed and uncomfortable. Until Chester Williams steps off the bus, and there is a collective sigh of recognition and wonder. Now, the kids can relate to the Springboks. Even Sipho, who looks on from the side of the field. Springbok management notes it. The TV crews note it. Pienaar notes it.
PIENAAR: Okay Chester -- I reckon you're up.
CHESTER WILLIAMS: What am I supposed to do?
PIENAAR: What you do best. Pienaar turns to the throng.
PIENAAR: A roar. They all do. Pienaar opens the net bag full of rugby balls, gives a ball to Chester.
PIENAAR: Let rip.
PIENAAR: Let's do our best. One after another, the Springboks kick the balls high into the air.
PIENAAR: Go get them! The kids go after them. Sipho stays on the sideline.
SPRINGBOK HOOKER: Who here knows the first rule of rugby?
TOWNSHIP KID: Me!
SPRINGBOK HOOKER: What is it?
TOWNSHIP KID: Only hit the other players when the ref isn't looking! Laughter. A good ice-breaker.
PIENAAR: No. The first rule of rugby is you can only pass the ball backwards or sideways. Pienaar demonstrates. (NOTE: All the rules are demonstrated.)
VARIOUS SPRINGBOKS: - If you drop the ball, or pass it forwards, you scrum for possession. - This is a scrum. - You kick forwards.
(MORE): VARIOUS SPRINGBOKS (cont'd) If you kick it out of bounds, you throw it back in to a lineout. - This is a lineout. - You score in four ways: a try, when you dot the ball down behind the try line. That's five points. - Another two points when you convert the try by kicking the ball through the uprights. - Three points for a penalty kick. - Three points for a drop kick. - Have you got all that?
KIDS: No!
SPRINGBOK HOOKER: Agh, bugger it, let's just run and pass. Whoever drops the ball does pushups! SECOND, as the players work with the kids, they get into it. Much to their own surprise, they enjoy the energy, they enjoy the kids, they enjoy the giving. Even the grumpiest, most conservative Springbok.
SPRINGBOK LOCK: Okay. Who wants to scrum against me? One huge man scrums against a horde of kids. He pushes them backwards with a roar -- then lets them push him backwards. They love it, the cameras love it. THE THIRD THEME shows the emergence of Chester Williams as the face of the Springboks. The crowd of kids around him is twice as big as any other player's crew. Given Chester's basically shy nature, he finds it all a bit overwhelming. The TV cameras follow him even more closely than they follow Pienaar. AT ONE POINT, an errant pass puts a rugby ball right at Sipho's feet. He hesitates, then picks it up. He doesn't just hold it, he feels it. END THE MONTAGE as the luxury bus pulls away, surrounded by a horde of cheering kids, many of whom hold new rugby balls under their arms. One blast on the horn, one answering cheer from the kids and the bus slowly accelerates away.
MANDELA: Mr. Minister, please forgive me. This sounds excellent, and we will return to it, but if you'll indulge me for just one minute -- Mandela nods to Mary, who switches on a big TV on the wall -- which shows NEWS FOOTAGE OF THE COACHING CLINIC in the township. When we see the FOOTAGE OF THE LOCK SCRUMMING WITH THE KIDS, Mandela laughs, delighted, turns to his cabinet.
MANDELA: You see, that picture is worth any number of speeches.
BOLAND BOTHA: -- where the Springbok flight has just landed.
CUT TO:: ON THE APRON, the team disembarks. The boys are dressed in Springbok blazers, slacks and ties. A magnificent sight. Gladiators in top shape, faces appropriately stern.
BOLAND BOTHA: I say cautiously, because in my humble opinion -- Behind Boland, the Springboks get into the bus, fast.
BOLAND BOTHA: -- this team has been over-trained on the field, and over-committed off it.
BOTHA --: Mandela switches off the TV.
MANDELA: Around the world -- objectively -- what are they saying about our chances against Australia?
MANDELA: So it is very important that we beat Australia. (to Minister of Sport) Thank you.
BARBARA: The Cabinet Ministers are here to brief you on the trip to Taiwan.
MANDELA: I'll be right out. From memory, Mandela writes the first line of the poem: Out of the night that covers me ...
COACH: One week, boys. Excited faces become grave, serious. The bus goes quiet. Coach nods to himself, pleased.
JASON: We need snipers on top of the stadium and these surrounding buildings. Jason leads the meeting. He uses an old-fashioned pointer. All of Mandela's security detail present, plus LOCAL COP
LOCAL COP: Not a problem.
JASON: We want these two approaches completely sanitized.
LOCAL COP: Two approaches?
JASON: We're not going to decide which way we bring him in until the very last moment.
(BEAT): We need uniforms, plain clothes, sharp-shooters ...
LINGA: And sniffer dogs.
JASON: Yes. No truck bombs, no Oklahoma City. The locals stir, share a look. This is going to be a nightmare.
JASON: We've got an army unit on standby at Silvermine, if you need more men. Not an option the cops favor, judging by their faces.
JASON: We're not taking any chances, okay. The President's going to be very exposed.
(BEAT): Much too exposed.
MANDELA: Barbara, I have been studying.
BARBARA: For the summit in Taiwan? Good.
MANDELA: No. Not exactly. Mandela hands Barbara a folded SPORTS SECTION.
MANDELA: Test me. Barbara unfolds the sports section -- -- to reveal COLOR PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE SPRINGBOK SQUAD. A collector's pull-out. Barbara looks at the photos, shakes her head.
BARBARA: They look like thugs. Mandela just smiles at that remark.
MANDELA: Block out the names. See if I can recognize them. Barbara gives her boss a put-upon look -- this is such a waste of time! -- but blocks out the first row of names. Mandela points at the first photo.
MANDELA: Andre Joubert.
MANDELA (CONT'D): Gavin Johnson.
(BEAT): Did I get them right?
BARBARA: Yes, Madiba.
MANDELA: (immensely pleased with
HIMSELF): This is how I used to study in law school. (next photo is of Chester) Unfortunately, Chester is far too easy to identify. But that will change. It must.
PIENAAR: Players-only meeting in the team room after dinner.
SPRINGBOK HOOKER: What's this? Homework?
PIENAAR: Sort of. The players look down at the pages. ON A PAGE: the words to Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika, in Xhosa. One by one, the players look from the page to Pienaar.
SPRINGBOK WING: Cappie? What's this?
PIENAAR: We need to learn it. We can't just mouth the words anymore.
SPRINGBOK HOOKER: Nobody cares, as long as we win matches.
PIENAAR: They do care.
SPRINGBOK LOCK: It's their song, not ours.
SPRINGBOK WING: It's a terrorist song.
SPRINGBOK PROP: They used to arrest you for singing it.
PIENAAR: And now it's one of our anthems. But he's talking to a deeply conservative group of guys.
SPRINGBOK HOOKER: Cap. You know I leave my guts on the field for you, and you know I'd follow you into a fight anywhere, any time. But this ... The hooker crumples the page, is about to throw it away.
SPRINGBOK HOOKER: ... I can't even read it. I definitely can't pronounce the words. One look at his men, and Pienaar knows he has hit a wall.
PIENAAR: Okay, boys. It's optional. Take it if you want to. The players are relieved. Pienaar looks down at the sheet of paper for a moment, then looks up at the guys.
PIENAAR: It means "God Bless Africa".
(BEAT): Which you have to admit, we could use. Nonetheless, most of the players crumple the pages, toss them into the closest trash can.
BOLAND BOTHA: Tell us, Mr. President, have you always been a rugby fan? Mandela appears with Boland Botha on his show, under a ONE TEAM, ONE NATION banner.
MANDELA: People do not realize that I once played rugby myself, when I was a student at Fort Hare. It is a very rough game. Almost as rough as politics. Boland laughs.
MANDELA: After all, if I cannot change when circumstances demand it, how can I ask others to?
JASON: We're going to land you on top of that building. We'll own the road between it and the stadium. Mandela likes it. Jason gives the pilot a nod and they take off down the peninsula towards Silvermine Army base. FROM THE HELICOPTER, MANDELA LOOKS down at his country, and finds it good.
MANDELA: Francois, gentlemen -- forgive me for interrupting your work the day before such an important match ...
(BEAT): ... I just wanted to wish you good luck, in person. There is a naughty twinkle in Mandela's eye.
MANDELA: And sometimes, very seldom, as President, I am allowed to do what I want. They all laugh.
PIENAAR: Mr. President, this is --
MANDELA: I know who this is.
(SHAKING HANDS): Good luck, Andre. (shaking hands with all of
THEM): Good luck Brendan, we're behind you all. Japie -- etc -- every single one of whose names he has committed to memory. Statesmanship is often about attention to detail. The players are awe-struck. (FOR THE RECORD: Andre, Gavin, James, Japie, Christiaan, Brendan, Hennie, Joel, Johan, Joost, Marius, James, Chris, Pieter, Garry, Mark, Kobus, Hannes, Krynauw, Ruben, Francois, Robby, Adriaan, Rudolf.) CUT AWAY to Jason and Linga, who are amazed by what they're seeing.
LINGA: Did you ever imagine this?
JASON: How could I? By the time Mandela has shaken every single player's hand, he has won the team over, coach and manager included. They glow. And then, Mandela frowns, steps back, looks at all of them.
MANDELA: But where is Chester? Pienaar doesn't answer immediately, he looks at his coach first. Coach nods.
PIENAAR: He's injured, sir. His hamstring. We're trying to keep it quiet.
MANDELA: Is he out for the whole tournament?
PIENAAR: With hamstrings, who knows?
(BEAT): We'll miss him.
MANDELA: The whole country will miss him. A somewhat sour note to leave on. But it's about to be rescued.
SPRINGBOK PROP: Mr. President, sir --
MANDELA: Yes, Hennie.
SPRINGBOK PROP: -- this is for you. From us. The huge, thick man holds out a GREEN CAP with gold piping and a Springbok leaping above the visor. Mandela takes the cap as if he has just been given a holy relic.
MANDELA: I am honored. Truly honored. Mandela runs his finger over the embroidered Springbok leaping across the front of the cap.
MANDELA: Good luck gentlemen. Your country supports you, completely. The team applauds, beaming, glowing. Mandela turns to go back to the helicopter.
MANDELA: Francois, walk with me. Pienaar walks Mandela back towards the helicopter.
MANDELA: I have something for you. Mandela reaches into his jacket, pulls out an ENVELOPE WITH THE PRESIDENT'S LETTERHEAD on it. Gives it to Pienaar.
MANDELA: This helped me, many times. Perhaps it will help you, too.
CUT TO:: Pienaar holds the envelope, stares upwards at the rising, departing helicopter, as do the rest of the team -- until Coach blows his whistle.
COACH: Enough fun and games! We've still got work to do.
MARY: It's time for bed.
MANDELA: I think I'll stay up a little longer. The country is excited tonight.
MARY: You need to sleep. The doctor said.
MANDELA: The doctor has no sense of occasion.
COACH: There's nothing more we can do. The game plan's good. It's just a matter of the boys executing it tomorrow.
MANAGER: That's Pienaar's job. It's in his hands, now.
NERINE: You know the best thing about you being the captain?
PIENAAR: Uh ... the honor?
NERINE: You don't have to share a room. Nerine gives Pienaar a scorching kiss. He resists ... then responds -- then pulls away.
NERINE: Francois, come on. It's been weeks.
PIENAAR: Uh uh. I need to be angry for tomorrow. Nerine takes a deep breath, nods, turns away -- and sees the poem on Mandela's personal letterhead.
NERINE: What's this?
PIENAAR: A poem. From the President.
NERINE: How does a poem help you play rugby?
PIENAAR: The same way your visit does.
(BEAT): Inspiration.
CUT TO:: But not for Chester Williams. Clad in Springbok blazer and tie, he sits behind the coach, the manager and the reserves, in the stands -- and almost succeeds in hiding his utter disappointment at not being on the field.
LINGA: What happened?
HENDRICK: They scored. When another ball soars between the uprights and the crowd roars, Linga asks again:
LINGA: What happened?
HENDRICK: We scored. A third ball through the uprights. Before Linga can ask:
HENDRICK: They scored again. A fourth ball, to the joy of the others in the box.
LINGA: We scored?
HENDRICK: Ja. We're tied. A fifth ball through the uprights, and the crowd goes wild.
HENDRICK: We're up by three. ACTION ON THE FIELD, as a Wallaby drive combining backs and forwards moves relentlessly towards the Springbok try line. Six times the drive is stopped by Springbok tackling, but the Wallabies keep possession and, on the seventh wave of the assault score a beautiful open try, which is converted. A ripple of concern goes through the crowd -- -- and the VIP box.
LINGA: They're ahead?
HENDRICK: By four. Nerves in the box.
LINGA: What does that mean?
HENDRICK: We're only ahead by one. Another penalty kick.
HENDRICK: We're ahead by four. A drop goal.
HENDRICK: By seven. An incredible try by the Springbok fly half.
HENDRICK: By fourteen. Everyone dares to dream. The classic South African penchant for pessimism begins to abate. Two things to note: The crowd roar grows and grows and grows and is echoed in the VIP box. Even Jason turns to look at the action on the field -- but only for a second. Also, this match serves as the coming-out party for the SPRINGBOK FLY HALF, who scores 22 of South Africa's 27 points this day. SUDDENLY, A REFEREE'S WHISTLE CREATES PANDEMONIUM on the field, in the stands, and in the VIP box.
LINGA: What happened?
HENDRICK: We won!
LINGA: We did? Mandela shoots to his feet, pushes his chair away and begins the famous "Mandela shuffle" -- a very cool African boogie that is one of his signature moves. ON THE MANDELA SHUFFLE --
TROPHY WIFE: You must be very pleased!
MANDELA: What man would not be pleased to be dancing with a beautiful woman like you?
TROPHY WIFE: Oh, Mr. President, you're exaggerating.
MANDELA: Indeed not. My father was a Xhosa chief, and therefore a polygamist. As you know, I am not.
(BEAT): But when I look at you ... I envy my father. The man is a major flirt, and really enjoying himself. But, once again, he is dancing with a stranger -- -- and, when we get close to his eyes, we realize that Mandela is pushing himself way past empty.
PIENAAR: The Springbok shakes his head -- bloody coach -- grabs the player next to him, repeats it. Pienaar watches the message travelling through his team -- and grins. Then, something catches his eye on one of the big overhead TV's. ON THE TV: news footage of the Mandela victory boogie. The boogie is followed by a quick "How far we have come" type of montage. One of the images shows an island ringed by rough surf. Pienaar gets an idea.
CUT TO:: Another intersection, another peek at the map on his hand, and another left turn, takes the team --
COACH: I hope you're not that slow next week. Pienaar grins, stops. The team stops around him.
SPRINGBOK FLYHALF: What's going on?
PIENAAR: A change of pace.
SPRINGBOK HOOKER: Who's bloody idea was this? ON PIENAAR, innocent as a lamb.
SPRINGBOK LOCK: How do they bring the prisoners here?
DECKHAND: On this boat. Sobering.
NERINE: Imagine being able to see Cape Town so close by.
PIENAAR: That would make it worse. They head towards the prison entrance, slowly becoming a tighter and tighter bunch. The ghosts of Mandela, and all the others who spent much of their lives here, are very strong.
CUT TO:: VARIOUS SHOTS OF THE SPRINGBOK PARTY, in the EXERCISE YARD, the LIME QUARRY, the MESS HALL. None of the usual horsing around. This place affects them, deeply.
PIENAAR: Can we see the President's cell?
PRISON GUARD: Yes, of course. (leading them down past
THE CELLS): We've done it up just the way it was. They reach a cell with a piece of white cardboard on the door, showing the number 466/64 -- MANDELA'S PRISON NUMBER.
PRISON GUARD: (pointing at the number) That means he was the 466th prisoner admitted in 1964. The Prison Guard unlocks the door, pulls it open, then unlocks the metal grill that is the inside door.
BARBARA: What happened?
DOCTOR: It's simple exhaustion, but it'll lead to worse if it's not treated. He needs complete rest. And I don't mean just shifting the affairs of state to his bedroom.
DOCTOR (CONT'D): No phone calls, no visitors, no meetings. No politics.
MARY: You know him. He won't do that.
DOCTOR: Then I'm going to put him into hospital. In isolation.
BARBARA: No. Not yet. I'll threaten him with hospital if he doesn't behave.
MARY: I'll cancel everything.
DOCTOR: And I'll come back tonight to make sure he's not working. The doctor leaves. The rest of them look at each other, relieved ... and maybe a little guilty, for letting things get this bad.
BARBARA: (to Mary, aside) Don't cancel the trip to Taiwan. Not yet.
COACH: That's not good enough. Chester opens it up. Full sprint, sustained. Pienaar grins. Chester is back.
COACH: Let's hope the Samoans don't injure it again.
CUT TO:: FOUR QUICK SHOTS of Chester williams scoring four tries.
CUT TO:: ONE MORE SHOT of the Springboks trudging off the field. Every single player is bruised or bleeding, or both.
BARBARA: Madiba, this is --
MANDELA: I know who this is. Beaming, exuding energy we know he doesn't have, Mandela rises to yet another occasion. He strides forward to shake hands.
MANDELA: Welcome, and thank you for coming such a long way to see me.
COACH: Forty minute postponement. They're trying to clear the field.
MANDELA: Please excuse me for a moment. With Mary leading the way, Mandela goes to the back of the plane, looking grave and leaderly -- -- but once he is through the galley curtain, he breaks into a huge smile.
MANDELA: This is very good ... very good! Who is our opponent?
MARY: The All Blacks play England tomorrow. Then, we'll know.
MANDELA: Please make sure that my schedule is clear for the entire match.
MARY: Yes, Madiba.
MANDELA: Let's do some work while we watch. Barbara resists her natural impulse to work and says:
BARBARA: Just enjoy the rugby.
KWEZI: So, let me understand this. The All Blacks are killing a team that thrashed us last year?
ETIENNE: Thanks for reminding me. Hendrick opens the trunk of their BMW, pulls out a RUGBY BALL, shows it to Linga. Linga nods. Okay. Throw it.
SPRINGBOK HOOKER: We're going to have to tackle better than the English, that's for sure.
PIENAAR: We do.
MANDELA: Are those the judicial appointments for the Free State? -- and Barbara shuts the file.
BARBARA: They'll keep until after the match.
ETIENNE: Give it a spin when you pass it.
(DEMONSTRATING): Like this. Kwezi catches the ball, tries to throw it with spin, blows it. The ball bounces crazily all over the street, seems to have a mind of its own as it eludes Kwezi. They all laugh.
SPRINGBOK WING: How much does Lomu weigh?
SPRINGBOK FLANK: About 120 kilos.
SPRINGBOK LOCK: Shit, that's what I weigh.
SPRINGBOK WING: Ja, but at least you're slow. As we will discover, the wing is going to have to defend against Lomu.
MANDELA: Come and look at this.
HENDRICK: You should've played rugby.
LINGA: They wouldn't let me carry my gun. Laughter. This scene was unthinkable a year ago.
MANDELA: Do you still think I'm wasting my time with the rugby? Before Barbara can reply, excitement on the TV makes Mandela turn away. He looks at the TV just as Lomu scores his fourth try, to make it 42 - 15. Mandela shakes his head, awed.
MANDELA: Barbara, can you please tell the Minister of Sport that I need a detailed briefing on the All Blacks. Barbara gives Mandela a long look.
BARBARA: This rugby, it's still strictly political?
MANDELA: Oh yes. Of course.
PIENAAR: Don't lose them. I won't be able to get more. Mr. Pienaar opens the envelope, pulls out TICKETS TO THE WORLD CUP FINAL. Mr. Pienaar kisses the tickets.
MANDELA: 145 points, in one match? Linga listens openly.
MANDELA: 45 to 29. And it was not that close.
(BEAT): They seem unstoppable.
(BEAT): And, also, there's the business of the haka.
MANDELA: Their Maori war dance. Yes. It's very powerful.
MANDELA: How are we going to beat them?
MANDELA: No ... no. I don't want to break their focus for even a minute.
(INTENSE): But, how do we win? ON LINGA: an idea occurs to him. A wild idea. He almost turns and blurts it out -- restrains himself.
(BEAT): Madiba, we've already exceeded all expectations. On and off the field.
MANDELA: It's not enough. Not now. Not so close.
(BEAT): This country is hungry for greatness. Barbara pushes another paper in front of Mandela. He signs it.
COACH: How's the feeling in the dressing room?
PIENAAR: Calm.
MANAGER: And Lomu? Are they talking about him? Pienaar shrugs -- of course. Coach grins.
COACH: Nobody gives us a bloody chance. I like that. It plays into their one weakness. Both Pienaar and the manager look at the coach.
COACH: Their vanity.
(BEAT): They're already counting the win. But they want to win with style, the way they won all their other matches. They want to show the world how beautiful All Black rugby is.
(GLARING): I just want to show the bloody world how hard we tackle. Pienaar's up for that.
PIENAAR: I wish tomorrow was already here.
ETIENNE: (from behind him) Come on, man. There's nothing more you can do today. Jason turns to Etienne.
JASON: Have I ever mentioned to you that I hate rugby?
ETIENNE: Once or twice, yes.
JASON: I just want to get him through tomorrow, safely. That's all.
ETIENNE: We all do. A look between the two men: they are united. They have come a long way.
NERINE: I brought one of your mom's protein shakes. Pienaar nods, thanks. Nerine puts the protein shake down. She tries to read Pienaar's mood, see what he needs from her at this moment.
NERINE: Thinking about tomorrow?
PIENAAR: No, tomorrow's taken care of, one way or another. Pienaar turns to her.
PIENAAR: I'm thinking about how you spend 30 years in a tiny cell, but come out ready to forgive the people who put you there.
LINGA: Big day.
HENDRICK: Be an even bigger day if we actually won.
HENDRICK: Where is he? They share a worried look. Linga reaches for his radio.
MANDELA: Can a man not sleep in, when he has a big day ahead of him?
LINGA: Okay, thanks. Out. Linga lowers his radio, embarrassed.
LINGA: He's sleeping in.
HENDRICK: Or was. Linga and Hendrick stand at the gate for a moment, then turn to head back to their respective cars. Linga pauses.
LINGA: I had an idea. About today.
(BEAT): It's a crazy idea.
HENDRICK: Hey, don't worry, man. I already know you're crazy.
MANDELA: Morning, boys.
LINGA & HENDRICK: Morning, Madiba.
MANDELA: What is it? Linga hesitates -- until Hendrick gives him a (for Hendrick) discreet nudge.
HENDRICK: Linga had an idea, sir.
HENDRICK: Now you've done it.
JASON: The tickets sold out long before the team became so popular. So it's not exactly going to be the rainbow nation out there. That's the reality.
(BEAT): The President will greet the players before the match, he'll present the trophy after the match. He'll be exposed to 62,000 people, twice. He'll be on TV, live, all over the world. (expressing his deepest
FEAR): All it takes is one idiot trying to make a statement, or one crazy fool who thinks he hears god speaking to him over the radio. One of the cops smiles at that.
JASON: It's happened before!
(SUPER INTENSE): But not today. Not on our watch. Not today. The security boys are fired up.
FACE PAINTER: Face flag?
BOER: Bugger off! Ellis Park isn't exactly the Rainbow Nation today.
PITCH --: Boland does another live remote. FANS CHEER AND WAVE behind
BOLAND BOTHA: -- because their beloved green and gold have somehow managed to exceed all expectations.
BOLAND BOTHA: So, take a reality check, sit back and share an afternoon with one billion fellow fans around the world. And as you do, feel a special pride in having made it this far. This is Boland Botha, signing off and sitting back at Ellis Park. Huge crowd now, all around the TV truck, streaming in.
EUNICE: What's Mr. Francois doing now?
CUT TO:: ANOTHER ANGLE of a SOUTH AFRICAN AIRWAYS 747 flying over the city, in the direction of Ellis Park.
CO-PILOT: Final approach, Captain.
CAPTAIN: Let it be noted that I'm taking control of the aircraft.
CAPTAIN: I assume full responsibility for what happens from now on.
CO-PILOT: Duly noted. The captain drops the nose of the 747 towards Ellis Park.
JASON: Do you see that jet, to the east?
CUT TO:: Etienne, in another part of the stadium, looks eastwards -- sees it.
ETIENNE: Did they get clearance for this?
JASON: Not from us. The 747 gets closer, fast. Jason is hit by a horrible thought.
JASON: Where is he?
LINGA: Jason finds the VIP box, looks out at the 747 -- -- and realizes that the jet is heading straight at that side of the stadium.
JASON: Get him out of there. Now.
LINGA: No time.
CAPTAIN: Full throttle. Captain and co-pilot go full throttle, yank the 747 straight upwards.
SPRINGBOK WING: What the hell was that? ... which slowly fades ... ... leaving only the background roar of the revved up crowd. The boys jog in place, dying for the release of rugby. Pienaar appears to be praying, silently.
PIENAAR: Breathe, boys. Breathe.
CAPE TOWN: The crowd catches its breath. This is unprecedented, shocking ... and brilliant. The Springboks digest this extraordinary display of support.
SPRINGBOK HOOKER: (murmuring to Pienaar) The All Blacks won't like that. Pienaar nods, eyes glinting. Mandela is giving them an edge. As he walks towards the waiting teams, Mandela lifts the Springbok cap high, waves it, and fires his famous, beautiful, huge, African smile at the crowd -- -- who roar and stand, slowly, and start chanting, slowly ...
CROWD: Nelson ... Nelson ... Nelson ...
CROWD: ... etc. Mandela shakes hands with the Springboks, who are brimming with pride. Mandela shakes Chester Williams' hand with special energy.
MANDELA: I'm so glad you're here. Chester beams.
CUT TO:: IN THE STANDS, EUNICE ULULATES, loud African warrior woman call. Mr. Pienaar looks at her, shocked. Looks at her as a person for the first time, maybe.
CUT TO:: ON THE FIELD, Mandela shakes hands with the All Blacks, who, as predicted, don't like his partisan clothing. Mandela looks up at Jonah Lomu.
MANDELA: Hello, Jonah. Lomu looks down at Mandela, eyes glowing with aggression -- -- and suddenly, he bares his tattooed Tongan tongue in a
ALL SPRINGBOKS: -- SIKELEL' IAFRIKA etc ... With decent pronunciation, with full fervor and heart, THE BOYS ROAR THE ANTHEM back at the All Blacks. The crowd joins them. "Nkosi" roars through the stadium, through the nation. ON MANDELA: his heart swells, as he sings with his people.
CUT TO:: ON JASON, who stands surrounded by his former enemies singing the song that kept him -- kept all of them -- going through the apartheid years. In this stadium, at this moment, all hostility, all fear, are a thing of the past. The tension finally goes out of Jason's shoulders. ON JASON'S FACE, close to tears, as NKOSI slowly fades. As Mandela said -- a very inspirational song. BEGIN HEARTBEAT OVER. Is that a heartbeat, or an African drum?
CUT TO:: ON THE FIELD, the All Black fly half tees up the ball, for kick off. As the fly half back-pedals slowly, and pauses in readiness, waiting for the whistle --
CUT AWAY:: TO RAINBOW NATION FACES, poised all over South Africa, WATCHING ON TV and IN THE STANDS. Heart/drumbeat over. The last face is Sipho's.
MANDELA: (to NZ P.M.) Perhaps we should make a small wager?
MANDELA: I was thinking more along the lines of a case of wine. Behind Mandela, Linga and Hendrick suppress grins. They are outwardly professional -- but bursting with excitement.
LINGA: What happens now?
HENDRICK: Extra time. Twenty minutes.
LINGA: I don't think I can take it. No one can. Mandela paces. Everyone is drained.
PIENAAR: Who's the fittest team on this field? The answer lies in their eyes: they are. An All Black penalty goal makes it 12 - 9 almost immediately. A Springbok penalty goal answers. 12 - 12. Seven minutes from the end of extra time, the Springboks earn a scrum deep in All Blacks territory.
PIENAAR: Keep it here. Run it forward. The scrum goes down, wheels a little.
MANDELA: How long before the end?
CUT TO:: Mrs. Pienaar and Nerine are in tears. Mr. Pienaar hugs a shocked Eunice.
CUT TO:: AROUND THE NATION, an EPIDEMIC OF HUGGING begins. This spills out onto the streets later, but for now, let's restrict this to the people who've been watching the match together.
BOLAND BOTHA: Francois ... a few words ... The interview booms through the PA system. Pienaar just nods -- he isn't about to spoil the moment by reacting to this buffoon.
BOLAND BOTHA: ... great game, but I don't think you could've done it without the amazing support of these 63,000 South Africans -- Francois grabs the mike from Boland.
PIENAAR: (into mike, words booming) We didn't have the support of 63,000 South Africans today. We had the support of 42 million South Africans. The crowd roars. The Springbok manager grabs Pienaar's shoulder, points.
SPRINGBOK MANAGER: They're waiting for you over there. Pienaar turns, looks. Mandela waits at the podium, eyes alight with joy. In front of him is the WILLIAM WEBB ELLIS TROPHY, a big gold confection. Their eyes meet. Their eyes stay locked as Pienaar fights his way through the press, the officials, his own team, to the podium.
MANDELA: Francois, I want to thank you most sincerely for what you have done to our country. Pienaar shakes his head.
PIENAAR: Mr. President, I want to thank you for what you have done. Eyes lock again, for just a moment, blue eyes, brown eyes -- African eyes, both. And then PIENAAR RAISES THE TROPHY HIGH. A very traditional sports hero's moment, richly deserved. Real gold, against the green of the battered field. But that is not the real prize. The prize is what happens next, all over the nation.
DISSOLVE TO:: ALL OVER SOUTH AFRICA, people spill out into the streets, to celebrate. Utter joy, everywhere, as black and white, servants and employers, strangers, enemies, foreigners are swept up in love and happiness. People who have been suspicious of each other, hated each other, feared each other all their lives ... they hug each other on this day.
JASON: This route's too crowded. We're changing to route B.
JASON: Change to route C.
MANDELA: Tell Jason it's all right. There's no hurry.
LINGA: Madiba says no need to hurry.
