Monica: Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I
have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
Rachel: Me too!
Rachel: Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
Phoebe: Yes!!! Oh!!
Rachel: Hypothetically!
Phoebe: Still.
Rachel: Uh-hmm.
Phoebe: Wh-why is that the best part?
Rachel: Fine!
Woman: (sarcastically) Huh, good luck!
Phoebe: Aww, and good luck to you too! (To Monica and Rachel) What a nice lady!
Chandler: Die Hard still great!
Joey: Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
Joey: Die Hard 2.
Chandler: (looking at the tape) Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.
Joey: Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2!
Ross: Joey, we just saw it!
Joey: And?
Chandler: Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.
Ross: Well, John McClane had plans!
Chandler: No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all
worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
Joey: What are you talking about? Bitch.
Phoebe: Hey Rachel?
Rachel: Yeah?
Phoebe: Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of honor?
Rachel: Really?!
Phoebe: Uh-hmm.
Phoebe: But why does it even matter?!
Rachel: Why does it matter so much to you?!
Phoebe: And no, oh please, oh please let me finish. (Rachel stops talking.) Oh I
guess that was it.
Phoebe: Oh, thank you so much! (They hug.) Okay.
Phoebe: Oh I know.
Ross: What happened?!!
Ross: We fell asleep! That is all.
Ross: I think that would be best.
Ross: Okay. But not about this!
Ross: No touch! No touch!
Chandler: So uh, what did this woman look like?
Monica: She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.
Chandler: Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing
called a mirror?
Monica: Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?
Monica: What are you doing?
Monica: Oh my God yes! Who is she?
Chandler: Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.
Monica: Did you break up with her?
Monica: Why?
Monica: Fat?!
Monica: You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!
Chandler: Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still
feel bad?
Monica: Well, apparently she does.
Chandler: Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. (Monica is not
amused by that statement.) Seriously, good luck marrying me.
Joey: Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that
girl downstairs, remember? (Phoebe glares at him.)
Rachel: (shocked) You have been maid of honor before?!!
Phoebe: Na-uh, I am!
Rachel: How come you are?!
Phoebe: Because I cared enough to lie!
Phoebe: What are you talking about?
Phoebe: Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?
Joey: Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.
Phoebe: No! Coins hate me!
Phoebe: Hey there, you handsome thing. (Rachel and Phoebe exit.)
Ross: Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio. 
Joey: Hi.
Ross: Just uh, brought back your videos.
Joey: Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before.
Joey: Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!! 
Joey: Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!
Joey: Okay! When?!
Ross: All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
Joey: Uh-huh!
Joey: I want to do it again.
Joey: Why not?
Joey: Fine! Do you want something to drink?
Ross: Sure, what do you got?
Joey: Warm milk and Excedrin P.M. (Ross just leaves.)
Monica: Chandler! (Knocks on the door.) Chandler! I just figured out who you
are!
Chandler: Who?
Monica: Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day
I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?
Chandler: Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the
bathroom?!
Chandler: What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
Chandler: Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better
person and that is not the man you fell in love with!
Ross: No, 10 is the highest.
Joey: Why is 10 the highest?
Joey: (out of his Monica character) Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I
like that!
Rachel: Thanks!
Ross: Yes, very nice Rachel.
Rachel: Thank you judges.
Phoebe: Ugh, what a kiss ass.
Rachel: Oh!
Phoebe: Yes! Your honor?
Phoebe: Oh!
Joey: Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!
Rachel: Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
Phoebe: Hey! Do you want, do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!
Ross: It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.
Ross: Go!
Joey: Wow. (To Ross) Good speech.
Ross: Yeah, it really was!
Rachel: Aw, thanks!
Joey: Yeah.
Chandler: (she opens the door) Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember
me.
Julie: Hello Skidmark.
Chandler: Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken
up with you because you were overweight.
Phoebe: Really?! I won!
Rachel: What?!
Phoebe: The coins have finally forgiven me!
Joey: Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.
Ross: Yeah?
Joey: Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on
my couch. (Raises his eyebrows, questioning Ross to see if he wants to join him.) 
Ross: Why-why would I care about that?
Chandler: I would really love it if I could do both.
Chandler: What?
Monica: Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
Chandler: What?!
Monica: Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have
gained?
Chandler: A hundred and forty-five pounds.
Chandler: Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I
was 15!
Chandler: Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.
Monica: How?
Chandler: You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
Monica: Keep going.
Chandler: So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love
you.
Monica: Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?
Monica: I love you. (They hug and kiss.)
Rachel: Hi Pheebs.
Phoebe: Hi!
Phoebe: Oh yeah!
Phoebe: Ohh.
Phoebe: This stuff is great!
Rachel: You do? Why?
Phoebe: Because I think it means more to you.
Rachel: No, I was ten. I just developed early.
Phoebe: (looking at the picture again) Man alive!
Rachel: Hey!
Phoebe: Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.
Joey: Great nap.
Ross: It really was.
Joey: (reacting first by jumping up) Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God!
(Heads for his room leaving Ross.)
Ross: (slowly stands up and says quietly) Excuse me. (Exits.)
