Joey: Hey.
Rachel: Hey.
Joey: What are you doing?
Joey: (laughs) Why would you want to do that?
Rachel: So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
Rachel: And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on, help me move this.
Joey: No. No. No.
Rachel: No?
Joey: No. Rosita does not move.
Joey: As in Rosita does not move.
Rachel: Stevie the TV?
Joey: (glaring at her) Is there a problem?
Rachel: No! (Joey sets his beer and bag of chips down and heads into his room.)
Oh what does he know! Come on Rosita, us chichas got to stick together! (She tries pulling
on the back of the chair, until the hinge breaks and the back falls off.) You bitch!
Ross: (disappointed) Sure, do whatever you want.
Ross: Yeah?
Monica: Look at this. (Hands him the newspaper.)
Phoebe: What? What happened to the window in the attic?!
Chandler: (knocking on the window while outside) Sorry! (Runs off.)
Rachel: Joey, Joey I am so sorry.
Rachel: (grabbing her coat) Okay? You ready?
Ross: They kept your room for a while.
Ross: Come on, you know they love you.
Monica: As much as they love you?
Phoebe: (entering) Hey.
Ross: Hey.
Monica: Hey!
Phoebe: Ugh, I hate this year!
Monica: That was me and Ross.
Ross: What?
Phoebe: Oh yeah, like you never called!
Phoebe: Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office.
Phoebe: Oh okay. Umm, all right. (Picks up the phone and starts reading from the
script.) Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply
manager please?
Phoebe: Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.
Phoebe: Oh.
Phoebe: No. (Pause) Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?
Ross: Dad?
Ross: (entering with Monica) Hey!
Monica: I used to love to play restaurant.
Ross: Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
Monica: Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light
bulb to cook brownies! (She goes to the attic.)
Ross: What?
Ross: How are you ever going to sell this place?
Ross: No!
Earl: Not me.
Phoebe: May I ask why?
Earl: You wanna know why. You wanna know why?
Phoebe: I surely do!
Phoebe: Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
Phoebe: Chandler?
Chandler: My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita! (He runs out the
door, grabs the back of Rosita, and we can hear Joey and Rachel talking as they are coming
up the stairs. Neither of them have reached the landing yet.)
Rachel: You will like it!
Joey: Francette? What is she? A couch?
Joey: Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
Joey: Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous
things can happen!
Joey: (interrupting her) Can you tell me how this happened?
Rachel: Well no.
Joey: Miracle!
Joey: (angrily) Get your non-believer ass outta my chair! (She gets up and heads
for her room.)
Ross: Well, can you blame her?
Ross: Sure! Ooh-ooh, what about this?
Joey: Yeah, me too. (He flips up his armrest in disgust.)
Joey: Fine.
Joey: No. Really?
Rachel: Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!
Joey: (quietly) My chair heals itself.
Phoebe: Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you.
Earl: (laughs) Yeah! Right!
Phoebe: Oh sorry, boyfriend!
Earl: Oh no.
Phoebe: No, whatever! Anything!
Earl: Okay, I should, I should probably be getting back to my thing now. See ya.
(Hangs up.)
Monica: Hey guys! Hey!
Ross: Hey.
Monica: Hey, I just whipped us up some Easy Bake treats, they should be
ready in about three days.
Ross: (overacting as well) Yeah! Yeah! (Laughs.) Oh, this will make a great
memory.
Monica: (wary) Okay. So, which boxes are mine?
Ross: Well, these. These are yours right here. (Pointing to the boxes they just
created for her.)
Monica: Okay. (Starting to go through them) Oh! A coloring book! (Holding it
up.)
Ross: Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never
went anywhere without-without that coloring book.
Monica: (looking through it) Really? Wow! It looks like I had some trouble
staying inside the lines.
Ross: Nu-uh! (Grabs it and examines it.)
Monica: (holding up a glove) Oh, an old glove?
Monica: What?
Ross: Dad?
Monica: Just mine?
Rachel: Hey Chandler!
Chandler: Hey!
Rachel: How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling
massage, and speakers in the head rest?
Rachel: Well what if I told you you can do it in my apartment?
Chandler: (excitedly) Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is
making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of
the Year?
Rachel: Yeah.
Chandler: Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?
Rachel: Noo! (Laughs) Angels.
Rachel: What? Wh-hey!
Chandler: Joey you broke my chair!!
Joey: Your chair?!
Rachel: Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!
Joey: So, there was no miracle?!
Rachel: No Joe, no miracle.
Chandler: I think I should get the chair!
Joey: How do you figure?
Rachel: The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to
break a chair in half!
Chandler: So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
Chandler: What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!
Joey: Yeah! We are!
Earl: Phoebe? The lady who sells toner?
Earl: Why?!
Phoebe: Because it was fate that made me call you today!
Earl: I thought it was toner.
Earl: Really?!
Phoebe: Yes.
Earl: How?
Phoebe: Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl,
right? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl.
Earl: Well, was there anything else?!
Phoebe: Sure! (Thinks.) Umm, where are you from?
Earl: Philadelphia.
Earl: (inspecting it) Really?
Earl: Yeah-yeah.
Earl: Yeah.
Ross: All right. I think it was a mouse.
Monica: (shocked) What?!
Ross: (even more shocked) What?!!!
Ross: Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid
boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!
Monica: All right!
Joey: Oh yeah.
Rachel: Uh-huh.
Monica: (entering) Hey guys!
Rachel: Hey!
Joey: Hey!
Rachel: Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.
