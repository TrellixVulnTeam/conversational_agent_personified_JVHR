Chandler: (To Ross) Monica said wedding.
Monica: Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the
ceremony.
Rachel: Oh! I would love to read a poem.
Chandler: Do you think you could get through a poem?
Monica: Okay, so Ross will be doing the reading.
Ross: Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too.
Chandler: Too?
Ross: Yeah, I kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys.
Monica: Do you mind telling us what it is?
Chandler: Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking. (Winks in a spy-type
manner.)
Joey: (entering, excited) Hey!
All: Hey!
Monica: What is DOOL?
All: Oh!!
Chandler: So great things are happening at work and in your personal
life!
Ross: What? A brain transplant?!
Monica: Who are they killing off?
Joey: Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart.
Joey: Nice.
Monica: And the way she slaps all the time!
Rachel: Oh!
Rachel: Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.
Ross: Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the "brain
transplant," you are going to be her?
Phoebe: (Clears Throat) Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay?
Rachel: (They both look behind them.) Well, I'd have to say gay.
Phoebe: Yeah? Why?
Rachel: Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.
Phoebe: Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there. (Pointing to an
attractive man sitting at a table behind them.)
Rachel: Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.
Phoebe: (A woman with large breasts walks in the door) Ohh knockers will help us
figure it out. (She walks by and he checks her out.)
Rachel: All right, straight, and not subtle. (The man gets up and leaves.)
Phoebe: Ohh, he left his cell phone.
Rachel: Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.
Phoebe: Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.
Rachel: What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and
I answer and we start talking and we fall in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story?
Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.
Phoebe: I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.
Rachel: Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.
Rachel: Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.
Phoebe: No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.
Phoebe: Nice try.
Rachel: Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
Phoebe: Ah-ha! Too cocky!
Dina: What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!
Joey: That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do
that?
Cecilia: Oh, just years of experience.
Dina: (crying) Can I get some ice here?!
Joey: Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
Joey: Say what?
Cecilia: Oh that was a real person?!
Cecilia: Who told you that?
Joey: Oh uh, one of the writers.
Cecilia: Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?
Joey: Okay.
Phoebe: Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
Rachel: (checking the speed dial) All right, first name on the speed dial is
mom.
Phoebe: Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.
Rachel: Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last
blueberry muffin.
Rachel: (showing Phoebe her phone) His new girlfriend!
Monica: What is that?
Chandler: (turning around and looking) Oh my God!
Monica: What?
Monica: Nooo!!
Chandler: Yes!!
Monica: No, there is no way! It can not be Ross! (She looks through the
window and sees Ross practicing and fumbling around with the pipes.) Unbelievable! Why
is your family Scottish?!
Chandler: Why is your family Ross?!
Chandler: If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool
and the Gang.
Rachel: Hi Pheebs!
Phoebe: Hi!
Rachel: How are ya?
Phoebe: Good.
Phoebe: Yeah.
Rachel: And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it
rang I could just pick it up?
Phoebe: Yeah!
Rachel: And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
Phoebe: Ooh, now you lost me.
Rachel: You stole the phone!
Rachel: Phoebe!
Phoebe: That is a different phone.
Phoebe: That is damning evidence.
Rachel: You do know that I will be here when he comes over.
Phoebe: Oh? And how will you know what time to come over?
Rachel: You just said it!
Rachel: Oh Phoebe!
Rachel: Ohh! (Exits.)
Joey: See you in 2003. (She walks away.)
Cecilia: Yeah, thanks.
Joey: Joey.
Cecilia: Joey, well thank you. That is so sweet. Oh, excuse me. (She throws her
drink on a passing writer.)
Cecilia: All right Joey, I will help you. Not because I-I owe it to this stupid
show, but because I owe it to Jessica.
Cecilia: Is that supposed to be me?
Joey: Yeah.
Chandler: Well, I feel like a snack!
Ross: What?!
Ross: Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its
Scottish roots.
Monica: (interrupting) You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
Ross: How did you know about that?!
Chandler: We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
Ross: Were you the ones called the cops?!
Ross: Why not?
Chandler: Because we hate them.
Chandler: We have heard you play.
Cecilia: So, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. So, when
Jessica enters a room for instance, she owns everything and every person in that room.
(Joey is nodding.) You try.
Joey: Okay! (He scurries out the set door and re-enters, extremely impressed)
All right!
Joey: Okay. Okay. (He goes out and comes back in, glaring at everything.)
Joey: Like-like what?
Joey: (impressed) Wow!
Joey: Yeah! Okay. (He puts his hands on her face and they kiss.)
Rachel: Hey! Hey!
Phoebe: Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door?
Rachel: Well, then I get to give him the cell phone.
Phoebe: Okay. All right. (Hands her the phone.) Good luck explaining all the
calls to China.
Tom: Hi!
Phoebe: (To Rachel) Wow! How long were we arguing for?
Rachel: Is-is he coming? (Looks hopefully out the door.)
Tom: Umm, no.
Phoebe: Could you-could you umm, give us one second?
Tom: Sure!
Tom: Sure.
Phoebe: Wh-what do we do?
Phoebe: Can you believe this? (Rachel exhales in amazement.) We were waiting for
a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!
Rachel: I know! (Realizes what Phoebe said.) What?!
Rachel: (turning and looking at Tom again) No-no they do but, you just have to
wait.
Rachel: (fake disappointment) All right. All right Phoebe I will let you have
him, but you owe me; you owe me big!
Tom: So, which one of you lovely ladies am I going to take to dinner huh?
Tom: Okay. Okay. (Exits and Phoebe checks him out.)
Phoebe: (whispering) Nice!
Cecilia: Well, you certainly own that room.
Joey: Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you.
Rachel: Hi.
Joey: Hey!
Rachel: Oh my God! Oh my God!! Ohh, Jessica Lockhart!! In my apartment!! I am
such a huge fan! I am such a huge fan!
Joey: That uh, that is my roommate Rachel.
Joey: (shrugs) Sure. Yep.
Cecilia: Certainly.
Monica: Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?! (Points to
her cheek.)
Rachel: God. You seem really, really nice.
Joey: Okay, bye-bye.
Rachel: I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.
Joey: All right, here we go. (He grabs them and starts to pull them out of the
apartment.)
Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: You are so beautiful.
Joey: (notices something in the mail that Rachel brought in) Oh my God!
Cecilia: What?
Cecilia: How does it happen?
Joey: (flipping to the last page) Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an
electric fence.
Cecilia: Ah what?! Jessica hates horses!
Rachel: (giggles) (To Ross) I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee
socks.
Ross: (To Rachel) Do you wanna start telling secrets?
Rachel: No!
Ross: One, two, three, four!
Ross: You know the song! Sing along!
Ross: So?
Fredrick: Thank you sweetheart. (They clink glasses.)
Dina: Who are you?!
Cecilia: Well of course not, but you were very good.
Joey: Thanks!
Cecilia: And guess what? Good news! I got another job!
Joey: Great! Hey! Alright! Well-well what is it?!
Cecilia: A film in Guadalajara!
Joey: The airport?
Joey: Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone?
Cecilia: Eight months.
Cecilia: Yeah, but you can come and visit me. I bet that you could uh, own a few
places down there.
Joey: Good luck.
Cecilia: You too.
Ross: You know the song! Sing along!
Phoebe: Eeee!!! Eee!! Eee!!
