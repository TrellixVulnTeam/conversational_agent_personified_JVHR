Gunther: (bringing Rachel a mug) Rachel, I made you a cocoa. 
Phoebe: Oh my God, are you guys okay?
Gunther: Are you all right?
Joey: (leaving Central Perk and seeing Monica laying on top of Rachel who is
moaning in pain.) Oh my.

Joey: Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan.
Ross: (entering) Hey!
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: No way!
Ross: Thanks. You ready to go?
Chandler: Yeah. (they start to leave)
Joey: Saw a girl with that vest.

Pete: Hi!
Pete: Wow! Skates! 
Pete: Well... (he holds up a gift he brought her)
Monica: (popping back up) Regular or decaf?
Pete: Ah, which ever is closest. 
Monica: Okay. (hands him a cup)
Pete: So ask me what I did today.
Monica: So what did you do today Pete?
Pete: I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef.
Monica: What?! Oh.(She turns around quickly and falls)
Monica: Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
Rachel: What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
Monica: Oh, please. 
Monica: What? Honey.
Rachel: Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.
Rachel: I know. 
Rachel: Ow!!
Monica: Oh God!
Ross: (entering, wearing a white suit with a little red bow tie) Hey, you guys!
Guess what?
Rachel: (looking at the outfit) Got a job on a river boat?
Rachel: Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
Ross: Right.
Ross: (to Monica) You like it right?
Rachel: Yeah, come here!
Monica: What-what was it you were gonna tell us? 
Rachel: Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
Ross: Okay, good bye! (leaves)
Chandler: So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take
for the roller skating thing to happen.
Phoebe: Umm, oh, about three months.
Joey: (entering carrying a box) Hey!!
Chandler: Hey!
Joey: I got you something! Open it! Open it!
Phoebe: Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?
Chandler: Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.
Chandler: Easy Lenny.
Pete: So? I mean have you thought about it?
Monica: Huh?
Pete: No! Look, I was gonna tell you this over dinner, but I met somebody else.
On my trip.
Monica: Oh?
Pete: I guess you can.
Pete: All right.
Monica: Okay. (she gets ready to go) Can you give me a little push?
Pete: Yeah, sure. Good luck!
Pete: What?
Pete: Why would you say that?
Phoebe: Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?
Pete: Thanks a lot.
Chandler: Okay, but this is the last time. (singing) With a chick-chick here,
and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick-(Joey
enters)-chickeeeen.
Joey: Hey.
Chandler: Hey.
Chandler: She?
Chandler: Excuse me?
Joey: What?
Chandler: I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody
could be here with our chick!
Joey: Ohhh, here it comes.
Joey: Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!
Ross: (entering carrying a garment bag) Hey!
Chandler: Hey!
Ross: (sees the chick) Ohhh, hey! All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in
like two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you think? (takes out two suits) This
blue suit, or this brown one?
Joey: Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the
blue one.
Rachel: (she reaches for the bottle) Oww! (She grabs the bottle, but has trouble
opening it. She pops the top off and aspirins fly all over the place as Ross enters.)
Ross: Wow! That aspirin dance really works!
Rachel: (She bends over to try and pick up the aspirin) Oww!
Ross: Oh my God, is that still...
Rachel: Yes I am! 
Ross: Rach!
Ross: (stopping her from falling) Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go to a
doctor! Okay?
Ross: Rach...
Rachel: But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready.
Ross: Rachel...
Rachel: Look, either help me or go.
Rachel: (with a hurt expression on her face) Okay, but before you go, could you
help me first?
Chandler: (rushing in) Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out
of a VCR?!
Rachel: (She drops the brush) Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand!
Would you please, help me with this too?
Ross: Okay. This stuff? 
Rachel: Yeah.
Ross: All right.
Rachel: Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid.
Okay? Just sweep it.
Ross: Oke-dokey. (He pokes her in the eye with the brush.)
Rachel: Oh-ho!
Ross: Sorry.
Rachel: Okay, just sweep it.
Rachel: Right.
Ross: Sweep, sweep....(He starts to paint it on her eye, making it look like she
has a black eye.)
Ross: What? What?
Rachel: Blow it.
Rachel: Sophisticated like a hooker?
Monica: Hey!
Phoebe: Hey! 
Phoebe: What?

bed?
Ross: There you go! Good enough for your party, huh?
Rachel: Sure.
Ross: Yep?
Ross: Okay, come on! All right, I gotta go! So good luck at the party. Okay?
Rachel: Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?
Ross: (checks his watch) Sure, okay.
Rachel: Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around.
Ross: What?
Ross: Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want.
Rachel: What?
Ross: All I have to do is close my eyes. See? (closes his eyes) Woo-hoo!!
Rachel: Ross! Stop that!
Rachel: Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!
Rachel: Rosss...

Ross: Okay.
Rachel: I really do.
Ross: (He thinks about it) Of course I am. I just have to make a call.
Rachel: Okay.
Ross: Okay? (goes into the living room)
Rachel: Thank you. (She goes to take off her make-up and screams in pain)
Oww!!!! God!
Monica: Does it involve travel?
Phoebe: Noo!
Monica: Does it involve clogs?

Monica: Pete.
Pete: Okay, I love you. Is that so bad?
Pete: What?

Ross: Nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. Come on. (they go into her
apartment) Easy.
Chandler: (to the duck) Okay, now when you come back I hope you remember that,
that chick is not a toy! (He goes back into the apartment)
Rachel: What thing? What is this thing?
Ross: I was kinda, supposed to be on TV tonight for The Discovery Channel.
Rachel: Oh my God! 
Ross: Yeah.
Rachel: I cannot believe you.
Ross: What?
Rachel: That is the sweetest thing, I just....
Ross: (breaking the silence) You should get some sleep.
Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: Um-hmm, yeah.

Chandler: Having a swim.
