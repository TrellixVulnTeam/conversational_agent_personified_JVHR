Phoebe: Hey! I got you a present!!
Chandler: Oh my goodness! Where did you hide it?
Phoebe: I got it for your wedding and I ordered it weeks ago, and it finally got
here!
Monica: Oh my God!
Monica: Oh well, maybe we can put it in the guest bedroom.
Chandler: Oh, okay. 
Chandler: I kinda like it here.
Phoebe: Do you really like it?
Phoebe: Oh really? What was your first?
Chandler: Well what did it do?
Chandler: A vending machine?
Joey: (To Rachel) Do you think he saw us or can we still sneak out?
Rachel: They made you head of the department!
Rachel: Yeah.
Joey: I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant?
Joey: Ooh, great! Thanks!
Rachel: Huh?
Rachel: All right?
Phoebe: No. No! Yes! Ahh. Oh, would you look at that Monica? I just knocked off
all of your top scores, how sad.
Phoebe: Wait okay, if this game is gonna cause problems between the two of you,
then maybe I should just keep it.
Chandler: Why do you want to play this game so bad?
Rachel: Joey? Could you get that? (There is no answer and she goes and opens the
door to Joey.) What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?
Joey: I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.
Rachel: Hm-mmm.
Joey: Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?
Rachel: Now the filet mignon, what comes with that?
Rachel: Emmm. Now, instead of the vegetables, is there anyway I can substitute
the three-pound lobster?
Rachel: Okay. Wow! So I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date. So do
you have any moves?
Rachel: I knew it! I knew it. Come on tell me your moves.
Joey: Oh alright. Umm, well, okay, I usually start by having a bottle of wine
sent to my table from a fan.
Rachel: Oh my God. And that works?!
Joey: Well it does when you combine it with, "This is so embarrassing, I
just want to have a normal life!"
Rachel: Oh, you poor little famous man.
Rachel: (looks interested) Oh my God! Wow! That was fantastic, I almost leaned
in. I really almost did!
Rachel: Come on, just answer the question!
Joey: (exasperated) Queens.
Rachel: And so were-were you close to your parents?
Joey: Yeah, with my mom. Yeah, not so much with my dad.
Rachel: Why not?
Rachel: Huh?
Joey: Yeah.
Joey: Yes I am! Again so simple!
Monica: Hey.
Chandler: You are not going to believe what I did today!
Monica: Wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played Ms. Pac-Man
while I went off to work like some kind of chump?!
Monica: What is the matter with your hand?
Monica: Chandler, why would you do that?
Monica: You think this is clever?
Chandler: It is when you put it together with that one.
Chandler: Have you talked to him lately?
Monica: Honey you-you got to beat your scores!
Chandler: With the claw?!
Rachel: I am not gonna answer that!
Joey: Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross if
you had to, if you had to, who would you punch?
Joey: Chandler?
Joey: Me too! Hey Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!
Rachel: I know!
Rachel: Joey, I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose.
Joey: I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so
much.
Rachel: Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.
Joey: Huh. Huh.
Joey: Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lips
look irresistible. 
Rachel: How do you do that?
Rachel: Oh my God!
Joey: Why not?
Rachel: All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey, I had such a wonderful time.
Joey: Oh. (She kisses him.) Yeah. (She goes into her room.) Me to. (He then
starts to freak out.)
Ross: No, I ran. It was really far, and when did people stop understanding the
phrase, "Get the hell out of my way!"
Rachel: You what?
Rachel: Right. Wow!
Joey: Hey!
Rachel: Hi! Hey, remember how last night we were talking about that movie Cujo?

Joey: Have you ever tried to sit through Citizen Kane?
Joey: Oh right!
Rachel: Hey Joey, can I ask you something?
Joey: Yeah.
Rachel: After our date last night, did you feel a little weird?
Joey: Oh my God! You did too? It totally freaked me out, what was that?!
Joey: Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster.
Rachel: Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night.
Joey: Yeah me too, all night.
Chandler: I did. (Looks at his still deformed hand) But it came at a price.
Chandler: Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies. (They both
look at him.) Was it just me?!
Joey: Oh yeah, sure. (She gets up, walks towards the bathroom, and Joey watches
her go.) Ehhh.
Phoebe: I know!
Chandler: One more score to go! You can do it! (Touches her shoulder.)
Chandler: All right! Go left! Go left! Go right!! Go right!!
Ross: Phoebe!!
Joey: (incredulous) Alone?!
Rachel: Yes! But what is wrong with this dog?!
Rachel: Oh. Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?
Joey: Oh uh, okay. Yeah.
Joey: Oh sure, yeah, why not? (Sits on the arm of the chair.)
Joey: Terrified. (But for a totally different reason.)
