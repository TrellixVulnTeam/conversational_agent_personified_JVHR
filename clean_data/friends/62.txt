Joey: (Voice Over) Previously on Friends.
Ross: Is this about Mark?
Rachel: (shocked) Oh my God.
Rachel: Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look,
urrgh, maybe we should take a break.
Rachel: No. A break from us.
Mark: Hey, what do you want to drink?
Rachel: Nobody.
Ross: Is that Mark?
Rachel: Umm, honey, look he just came over to....
Ross: Yeah! Got it! (slams down the phone)
Monica: Hey.
Rachel: Hey.
Rachel: Well, we never actually got to dinner.
Monica: Ohhh, nice.
Rachel: No, we kinda broke up instead.
Monica: What?! (She accidentally starts the blender without the lid on it and
fruit flies everywhere.)
Monica: Oh no!! 
Rachel: No.
Monica: Rachel, you and Mark?!
Chloe: (entering from bathroom) Morning!
Ross: Yeah!!
Ross: Na-huh.
Rachel: So, I love you.
Ross: I love you.
Ross: Okay. (Ross starts frantically looking for a clock.)
Rachel: Bye.
Chloe: (entering from bedroom) Hey, what kind of puppy do you think I should
get?
Chloe: But my apartment is so...
Ross: You, you sure you need shoes? (Chloe nods her head) Okay. (reaches down
and picks up a shoe)
Ross: Yeah! 
Chloe: You must be so happy!
Chloe: Good luck, with your girlfriend. 
Ross: Oh, thank you. (She goes to kiss him, but he holds her coat up between
their faces to stop her.) Hey, hey. (opens the door, sees Rachel, and hides Chloe behind
the door) Rachel!!!!
Rachel: Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
Ross: Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
Rachel: So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
Ross: Yes, you can, very much.
Ross: (seeing the thumbs up) Ahhhh!! (Hugs Rachel tighter.)
Phoebe: Hey!
Monica: Hey.
Phoebe: Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?
Phoebe: Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.
Monica: So then you know? (Phoebe nods her head)
Phoebe: The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.
Monica: Oh, good. Thanks.
Phoebe: Now what is Fabutec?
Phoebe: Waxine!!
Monica: Yes! Have you seen it?
Monica: I know!!
Monica: Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain
forest!
Phoebe: They have the best stuff in there.
Chandler: Oh my God! Oh my God!
Chandler: Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more
important question. How dumb are you?
Ross: Yeah, okay. (he plops down into one of the leather chairs, with the
footrest extended.)
Ross: What trail?
Joey: (stomps on the footrest which pops Ross up into a sitting position) The
trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it!
(slapping his hands with each word) You always have to think about the trail!
Phoebe: (reading from the instructions) After applying the Waxine and linen
strips to leg number one, 
Monica: Did that!
Monica: Okay. (Does so.) Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
Phoebe: Was it not pain-free?
Monica: No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with
a little wax.
Phoebe: (Removing one of the strips) Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!
Ross: (entering) Chloe? Hi.. 
Chloe: Is this about me taking your watch?
Ross: You took my watch?
Ross: Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?
Chloe: Oh, well I tell Issac everything.
Issac: You dog!
Ross: Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.
Issac: Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place.
Ross: Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?
Issac: Yeah, we are.
Issac: Yeah, we are.
Ross: Right.
Issac: But, we are.
Issac: I can promise not to tell her again.
Ross: (entering out of breath) Jasmine? 
Jasmine: Uh-huh.
Jasmine: You did a bad thing!
Ross: Yes, I did.
Jasmine: Very bad!
Ross: Very bad.
Jasmine: Very, very bad.
Jasmine: No.
Jasmine: All right.
Ross: Thank you, thank you.
Jasmine: But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and he
knows Phoebe too.
Monica: Ow!
Phoebe: Oh!!
Monica: Ow!! Ow!!
Phoebe: Ow!!!
Monica: We were just waxing our legs.
Chandler: Off?!!
Phoebe: For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever
experience.
Joey: Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?
Phoebe: Uh-huh.
Ross: (forcing the door open) Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!!
Monica: What?
Chandler: Nothing, nothing.
Monica: (going over to listen at the door) Rachel said everything was okay.
Phoebe: (to Joey) What, what are they talking about?
Ross: Rachel?
Rachel: Just get away from me!
Ross: No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?
Rachel: A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!
Phoebe: Whe-where did he put it?!
Rachel: Ross, you had sex with another woman!
Monica: Oh my God.
Phoebe: Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not
grow at all yesterday.
Chandler: Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....
Chandler: (to Joey) He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.
Rachel: (opening the door) Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here! 
Ross: No!!
Rachel: Just get out! Now!!
Ross: No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
Rachel: Okay! All right! How was she?
Chandler: Uh-oh.
Ross: What?
Rachel: Was she good?
Ross: She was...
Joey: Awful! Horrible!
Chandler: She was not good. Not good.
Joey: She was nothing compared to you.
Ross: She, she was different.
Joey: Ewwwww!
Chandler: Uh-oh.
Rachel: Good different?
Ross: Nobody likes change.
Ross: What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Phoebe: Should we do something?
Chandler: Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.
Ross: Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant
nothing to me!
Rachel: And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!! 
Rachel: We were on a break!
Ross: That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.
Rachel: Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!
Rachel: God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!
Chandler: Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more
important things to worry about.
Ross: Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then
Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.
Ross: (pause) Yes I would.
Ross: (less sure) Yes.
Rachel: You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....
All: Ohhhhh!
Joey: Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. (makes like he is trying to send a telepathic
message to Rachel) Put olives on the pizza.
Chandler: Oh great, food with hair on it.
Phoebe: No, not the used wax.
Chandler: Because that would be crazy?
Ross: No anchovies.
Rachel: With ah, extra anchovies.
Rachel: Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in
the sauce?
Ross: You can have the last piece, if you want.
Rachel: Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.
Joey: You think I need a new walk?
Chandler: What?
Chandler: Are you actually saying these words?
Phoebe: Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.
Rachel: That is neither here nor there.
Ross: Okay, okay, okay.
Rachel: (softly) I think you should go.
Ross: What?
Rachel: (softly) I really think you need to go now.
Rachel: Yeah, what the hell did I know!
Rachel: Then how come it is?
Joey: Maybe she killed him?
Chandler: (to Joey) Is that your new walk?
Joey: (whispering) No, I really have to pee.
