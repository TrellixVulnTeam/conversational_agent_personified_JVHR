All: Rach! Come on! Rach!
Tag: (entering from her room) Hey.
Joey: They do!
Phoebe: Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast!
Monica: Chocolate-chip pancakes!
Rachel: Good ones?
Monica: They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.
Rachel: Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?
Joey: Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.
Ross: Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?
Ross: Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?
Rachel: Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to
this?
Joey: Yeah, your roommate is a soap opera star.
All: Come on Phoebe! You can do it Phoebe! Come on!
Rachel: There you go!
Rachel: Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean old Mrs.
Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!
Monica: Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something
stupid, like Ross.
Ross: Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation!
Okay? I-I have a child!
Ross: How hot do I look in this, huh?!
Phoebe: Oh, well get in line missy. (To Ross) So, can I have a ride stud?
Ross: Hop in. (Phoebe hops in.) Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life. 
Ross: Damnit! (Shuts the car off.)
Rachel: (glares at him) Get out, get out of my apartment. 
Phoebe: Least of all you.
Chandler: Ohh! (He quickly removes his hand and looks at it.)
Chandler: Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down! (Rachel turns off the
lights and everyone crouches. As everyone crouches, a ripping noise erupts from the
assemblage.)
Monica: Heyyy!! You got the door open!! (Giggles.)
Chandler: Hey-hey are you drunk?
Chandler: Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise
party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!
Monica: Noo!!!

Monica: Noo!!
Chandler: Yes!!
Monica: Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk! (Pause) That they know of.
Monica: Really?! You promise?
Monica: Okay. I love you so much. (Kisses him.)

Monica: What about your breath?! (Breathes on him.)
Monica: Okay. I can do that.
Chandler: Okay.
All: Surprise!!!
Woman: (To Joey) Is this yours?
Joey: Dude, you soooo need this car.

Phoebe: Wait! (Knocks on the door and Ursula opens it.)
Phoebe: Yeah. What?!
Phoebe: Nu-uh!
Phoebe: You have your birth certificate?
Ursula: Yeah, I got a big box of family stuff when my mom died.
Phoebe: Our mom.
Ursula: (sarcastic) Right! Okay. (Hands Phoebe her births certificate.)
Phoebe: Do you have my birth certificate?
Ursula: No, I sold it to a Swedish runaway.
Phoebe: (reading the certificate) Oh my God! Oh my God, we are 31.
Ursula: Yeah.
Phoebe: I just lost a whole year of my life.
Ursula: (sarcastic) Okay.
Phoebe: Your middle name is Pamela?
Ursula: Yes.
Phoebe: Well, I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is?
Ursula: Yes! Phoebe.
Ursula: Right, okay, then no.

party dress.
Monica: Yay!
Monica: (sees someone) Paul!
Chandler: (correcting her) Phil.
Monica: Phil!
Phoebe: Yay! I love drunk Monica!
Ross: Maybe that will liven up this party.
Chandler: (To Rachel) Okay, will you just go help her change please!
Rachel: Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.
Rachel: Ahh!
Ross: (to Tag) Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
Rachel: No! No-no, I love it. Thank you. (Kisses him.) 
Chandler: Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!
Rachel: Okay.
Chandler: For my last birthday you gave me a hug! (To Rachel) Okay, read
the card! Read the card!
Chandler: No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
Monica: All you had to do was buy the card!
Ross: What? (Glances over and sees the faces of the rest of the group, then goes
and sits down.)
Phoebe: Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you
wanna have them for your brother.
Rachel: No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should
already be with the guy I wanna marry!
Joey: (to the waiter) Hey! Are those crab cakes? (The waiter nods) Did I not
tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
Chandler: (To Monica) How are you feeling?
Monica: You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right
