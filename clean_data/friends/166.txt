Monica: Okay.
Joey: Oh my God! Is that why you guys had to get married?!
Joey: Ah. (To Chandler) Slow swimmers? (Chandler looks at him.)
Monica: (To Joey) Oh, about that. Joey, you have to change before the party.
Chandler: What?! What are you talking about?
Monica: What are you talking about?
Monica: Wait a minute! So you told people I was pregnant?! (Flash) Does this
look like a conversation that I want to remember?!
Monica: Yeah!
Monica: Why?!
Chandler: Why not?
Rachel: Oh my God, who is it?! (Phoebe rolls her eyes.)
Monica: Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.
Phoebe: What?! Well he never said that to me!
Phoebe: How about just the bridemaids?
Phoebe: It is.
Rachel: For you. (Chandler leaves.)
Phoebe: Oh my God!
Phoebe: So instead you told me Monica was pregnant.
Phoebe: Sneaky.
Rachel: Oh yeah.
Rachel: Oh! (They smile and the picture is taken.) Oh by the way?
Phoebe: Uh-hmm.
Rachel: James Brolin?
Rachel: Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.
Phoebe: (intrigued) Really?!
Chandler: No?
Monica: No.
Monica: What?!
Chandler: Yeah, the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will never
forget.
Monica: Oh that is so sweet!
Chandler: So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?
Monica: Yes.
Monica: Well, are you going to be able to do this?
Chandler: Not well.
Phoebe: So, are you ready to talk about it?
Rachel: No.
Phoebe: Now?
Rachel: No!
Rachel: Thank you.
Rachel: Phoebe!!
Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: Honey, stop it! I am not going to tell you until I tell him.
Monica: (seeing him) Oh sweet Lord.
Ross: Oh! Hello uh, Mona from her restaurant. (He uses his card to mouth those
words.) (Pause) Mona, wow what a, what a beautiful name.
Ross: Aw come on, Mona Lisa?
Mona: Uh-huh.
Mona: Really?! Well see? I never knew about her.
Ross: Linda Clickclocken. (Pause) So what uh, what-what table are you at? (She
shows him.) Oh, uh me too.
Chandler: Thank you.
Mrs. Bing: Dennis is a dear old friend and a fantastic lover.
Chandler: Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.
Mrs. Bing: Oh yes, Dennis is directing a new Broadway show.
Chandler: Funny: ha-ha or funny: (Mimes blowing his brain out.)
Ross: Hey! Uh, I thought, I thought you were at table six.
Mona: No, nine. (Shows him the card again.)
Chandler: What size shoes do you wear?
Joey: Uh, eleven, eleven and a half.
Chandler: Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance
floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?
Monica: Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?!
Monica: This is so huge.
Rachel: Sure, but come on, as big as your wedding?
Rachel: Yeah.
Monica: How?
Monica: Are you okay?
Waiter: Champagne?
Monica: Oh really?!
Phoebe: (shocked) What?! (deadpan) Why bother?
Monica: How do you feel?
Rachel: What?!
Phoebe: When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times
just to make sure.
Rachel: How many ways are there to do that?
Monica: You-you gotta take it now. Come on, do it as a present to me.
Rachel: Okay. Thank you.
Monica: Okay.
Rachel: Oh, you guys are so great.
Phoebe: See? This is why you register.
Mona: Hi!
Ross: Umm, would you like to dance?
Mona: Sure.
Ross: Yeah?
Mona: Yeah.
Ross: Oh great! (They get up to dance and Ross is interrupted by a little girl.)
Mona: Ohhhh!
Ross: Yeah? Hop on. (They start dancing and Mona sits down.) Is the pretty lady
looking?
Ross: Keep dancing.
Chandler: And the world will never know.
Joey: Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?
Chandler: Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of
Our Lives.
Joey: Hey!
Ross: No-no, thank you Miranda.
Ross: All right. (Walks over to Mona.)
Mona: How cute was that?
Ross: Oh-oh, were you, were you watching?
Ross: What? Of course you can! Hop on!
Mona: Okay, but I get to hop on after her. (Ross bites the air in response.)
Ross: I am so gonna score.
Ross: I like your bow.
Ross: (to the second girl) That was very nice Ashley.
Ashley: Can we do it again?
Ross: No-no. (Walks over to Mona again.) 
Mona: So, is it my turn now?
Ross: Oh! (Recoils in horror.)
Fat Girl: Gert!
Gert: Dancing on your feet! Like the other girls did it.
Ross: Okay. (Swallows hard.) Hop on Gert. (She does and Ross winces in pain.)
Joey: So did you uh, happen to catch my toast up there?
Monica: Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?
Chandler: Did it turn into sand?
Chandler: Why?
Rachel: How much longer?
Phoebe: 30 seconds.
Rachel: 30 seconds, okay.
Rachel: Oh I know. I know. (They hug.)
The Girls: No!! (The woman backs out.)
Monica: Go ahead Rach.
Phoebe: Okay.
Rachel: Okay.
Rachel: What?
Phoebe: Here. (Gives Rachel a tissue.)
Rachel: What?!
Rachel: Are you sure?
Phoebe: Well yeah, I lied before.
Rachel: Oh!
Phoebe: Now you know how you really feel about it.
Monica: Are you really gonna do this?
Phoebe: With who?
Ross: Oh, thank you.
Mona: That is so sweet!
Joey: Yeah.
Mona: No, I mean it. There are so few genuinely nice guys out there.
Joey: Yeah.
