Monica: Oh, so much fun. But the best part is, we met this incredible couple on
the way back.
Phoebe: That was the best part? (To Chandler) Good honeymooning tiger.
Monica: No, they were really cool. They were on their honeymoon too!
Monica: Yeah, can we go call them? Is it too soon to call? I wanna call.
Monica: I know.
Joey: A couple? Like two people? Like (points to himself) one (points to
Phoebe), two people?

Rachel: Oh! Look! I have a sonogram picture! 
Monica: Oh great! (Shows them the picture.)
Ross: (glaring at him) Yeah, thanks. (Joey nods no problem.)
Rachel: And so I had a lot of work to do so Ross, nice guy that he is, offered
to help me out. And then we had a little wine, we got to talking, and the next thing you
know out of nowhere Ross comes on to me.
Rachel: What is?
Ross: The lie you just told.
Rachel: That-that you came on to me?
Rachel: You know you kissed me first.
Ross: What? What?! You were begging me to kiss you! You-you-you were sending me
signals all over the place!
Rachel: I was sending you signals?
Ross: Yeah!
Rachel: Oh please. Okay, anyone in this room think that I would send Ross
begging symbols, please show of hands. (Ross raises his hand and no one else.)
Rachel: No please, show me how I begged you!
Joey: Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.
Phoebe: (nasally) Greg and Jenny?
Joey: Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs!
Monica: (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Eighth street deli?
Monica: (on phone) Uh sorry, wrong number. (Hangs up)
Chandler: Here you go. (Shows her the number again.)
Chandler: What?
Phoebe: You got fake numbered.
Joey: Oh I think we do.
Monica: They gave us a fake number? Why? Why would they do that?
Phoebe: Hmm, I wonder why. Pervert!
Ross: Okay, listen I am not a pervert!
Ross: Hey!
Joey: Hey.
Joey: Sure. What? About uh, you showering with your mom?
Joey: Whoa, for like months?
Ross: Five to be lying, six.
Ross: Really? Well then tell it to me.
Ross: (laughs) You were backpacking across Western Europe?
Joey: Have a nice six more months Ross! (Starts to leave.)
Ross: (intently listening) Why?
Kristen: Umm, this is great wine.
Kristen: Really?
Kristen: I studied for a year in Barcelona. (Ross is stunned and worried.)
Kristen: I love hiking!
Kristen: I think its Tibidabo.
Ross: Okay! Do you wanna tell the story?!
Joey: Whoa! What are you doing here? How did your date go?
Ross: I was backpacking across Western Europe.
Ross: Thanks.
Joey: Good luck.
Ross: Thanks. And-and hey Joe?
Joey: Yeah?
Joey: (trying not to laugh) That means a lot to me man. (Exits.)
Ross: Hello! Can I get you anything? Huh? Lens cleaner? Your battery okay?
(Rachel bursts in carrying two boxes and Ross jumps up.) Rachel!
Rachel: Oh Ross!
Ross: Hi!
Ross: (voiceover) So when she came in, I got distracted and totally forgot about
the camera. [Cut back to the present day.] It kept rolling and recorded everything.
Monica: Yeah, definitely.
Ross: What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me!
Ross: Joey! No!
Monica: I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.
Joey: Oh yeah? (To Phoebe) Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.
Phoebe: Regina Philange. (Ken and Regina shake hands.)
Monica: I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes.
Chandler: I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
Monica: (rolling her head from side to side) Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah! (Joey and
Phoebe laugh.)
Chandler: Well maybe it was all of your questions.
Monica: What about my questions?
Chandler: The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!
Chandler: (angrily) Was that another question?
Rachel: (entering) Hey! Is Ross still here?
Rachel: Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I taped
it? (Joey smiles luridly) Oh forget it! (Ross enters.) Oh there he is now, the father of
my child, the porn king of the west village.
Monica: Hell yeah!!!
Rachel: I am not gonna show you this!
Phoebe: No! Not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it.
Rachel: I wanna see it.
Ross: What?!
Rachel: Ah, a little preview!
Rachel: Okay, here we go. (Pushes play.)
Ross: (on tape) Hello! Can I get you anything?
Rachel: There I am.
Monica: I know.
Chandler: Did you do it on our invitations?!
Ross: (pause) Not on the ones we sent out.
Chandler: So, just the ones gave back to us and we had framed! (Slams the framed
invitation down onto the table.)
Rachel: (on tape) Can you believe this is already happening? I mean it seems
like yesterday they just got engaged.
Rachel: (on tape) Oh I wanted to.
Rachel: (on tape) Interesting.
Ross: (on tape) Yeah. (Pause) Anyway umm, it probably worked out for the best.
Rachel: (on tape) Oh yeah, sure.
Rachel: (on tape) Ross did I ever tell you about the time that I went
backpacking through Western Europe?
Phoebe: Oh, you came on to Ross!
Rachel: What?!
Rachel: What are you talking about?!
Monica: You used the Europe story!
Rachel: How do you know about that story?!
Joey: How do you know about that story?!
Rachel: I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from some guy!
Joey: (raises his hand) Some guy!! (Points to himself.)
Rachel: No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams.
Joey: (raises his hand and points to himself again) Ken Adams!!
Ross: Hi.
Rachel: So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?
Rachel: It was an amazing night.
Ross: It was. It was an amazing night.
Rachel: You think it looked amazing?
Rachel: Yeah, it would be really weird.
Ross: Good luck.
Rachel: Good luck to you.
Ross: Mind if I mute?
Rachel: Oh please. (He does so.)
Ross: Oh, oh there go the clothes.
Rachel: You are undressing very quickly.
Ross: Six months Rachel, six months.
Ross: Oh nice tan!
Rachel: Thank you! I had just gone to the beach that weekend.
