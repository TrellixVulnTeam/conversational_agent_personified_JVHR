Chandler: Do you realize you get louder each week?
Monica: Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.
Chandler: Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?
Ross: Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I
die. She made no such promise.
Rachel: Monica what? 
Phoebe: What?!
Rachel: What is the emergency?!
Rachel: Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.
Monica: Thank you.
Phoebe: Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small. (Points.)
Monica: Those are my eyes! Those are my breasts. (Points.)
Phoebe: Oh! Yeah! (Monica glares at her.)
Ross: ...everyone, this is Chandler!
Chandler: (seeing her) Okay.
Rachel: Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, "Chandler, even
though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more."
Monica: Ennnh.
Monica: Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!
Chandler: (writes what Joey said and waits for him to go on) Yeah?
Phoebe: Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.
Monica: No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
Chandler: You'll get one.
Monica: Oh yeah? When?
Chandler: All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are
married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
Monica: Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Chandler: Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
Monica: Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Chandler: No, no, no.
Monica: What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriageable about me?
Chandler: (trapped) Uh, uh.
Monica: Well?
Chandler: Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the back
of the chair he was sitting in)
Monica: (Comes up for below the covers and
looks concerned.) Do you think he knew I was here? (Chandler quickly looks at Monica not
knowing what to say.)
Chandler: Nice try.
Monica: Wait, wait, wait! (She puts a Shriner's hat on the turkey.)
Monica: Look! (She puts a big, yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird.)
Chandler: This is not going to work.
Monica: I bet this will work! (She starts dancing and Chandler cracks up.)
Chandler: You are so great! I love you!
Monica: What?
Chandler: Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I
just stopped talking!
Monica: You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
Chandler: No I didn't!
Monica: Yes, you did!
Chandler: No I didn't!
Monica: You love me!
Chandler: No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Monica: Then all your stuff would be here.
Chandler: Well, what if all my stuff was here?
Monica: You wanted it to be a surprise.
Chandler: Oh my God.
Monica: Yes.
Joey: Hey!
Ross: Hey!
Rachel: Hey!
Phoebe: Hey!
Rachel: Hey, what have you guys been up to?
Ross: Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because
Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.
Joey: How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?
Joey: (shocked) Has it been that long?!
Ross: Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.
Joey: Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
Chandler: I've had a very long, hard day.
Joey: Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
Chandler: Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
Joey: Okay.
Chandler: Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about
chicken.
Monica: Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
Chandler: Hey Joe!
Joey: (To Chandler) You?! (To Monica) And-and you?!
Monica: Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
Joey: How?! When?!
Chandler: It happened in London.
Joey: IN LONDON!!!
Chandler: The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a
big deal out of it.
Joey: But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone! 
Chandler: No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
Monica: Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay?
Just promise you won't tell.
Joey: All right! Man, this is unbelievable!
Chandler: (on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel is
absolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)
Rachel: Arghh!! (She quickly hangs up the phone and starts to pace around
wondering what to do.)
Phoebe: (looking out the window) Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! (Starts
yelling.) Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! (Chandler and Monica start taking each other's clothes
off.) Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
Rachel: What?!
Phoebe: (screaming) Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
Rachel: Oh my God!
Phoebe: CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!
Rachel: OH MY GOD!!!
Phoebe: OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
Rachel: Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
Phoebe: NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
Rachel: I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
Phoebe: YOU KNOW?!!!
Rachel: Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know, so you have to stop
screaming!!
Ross: (entering) What's going on?
Rachel: (trying to divert his attention from the window by jumping up and down)
HI!! Hi! 
Ross: What?! What?!
Rachel: Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this
apartment!
Ross: Actually, it looks really good. (Turns towards the window and now Phoebe
starts jumping to divert his attention.)
Phoebe: (Screaming incoherently.) Get in here!!! (Motions to join her and
Rachel.)
Phoebe: Okay, so now they know that you know, and they don't know that Rachel
knows?
Joey: Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us
know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would
finally be over!
Phoebe: Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our
own
Rachel: All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
Monica: Bye!
All: Bye!
Phoebe: Bye Chandler! (She walks up to him.) (Quietly.) I miss you already. (She
pinches his butt.)
Chandler: (after they've left) Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate
and the pinching!!
Monica: Actually, I did!
Chandler: Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
Monica: Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
Chandler: Phoebe knows about us!
Joey: Well I didn't tell them!
Monica: Them?! Who's them?
Joey: Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
Monica: Joey!
Joey: And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
Chandler: Ahh yes, the messers become the messees!
Phoebe: I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! (Hangs up.) Oh my God!
He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
Rachel: Are you kidding?!
Phoebe: No!
Joey: No.
Rachel: Joey!
Joey: They know you know.
Rachel: Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
Phoebe: God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with
us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! (Joey just shakes his head.) Joey,
you can't say anything!
Joey: I couldn't even if I wanted to.
Chandler: Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put
lotion on her! 
Monica: She's bluffing!
Chandler: Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a little
mimic of her dance.)
Phoebe: He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
Joey: (entering the hall) Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!
Rachel: Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler
the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
Joey: Ooh!
Rachel: Okay!
Joey: I like that! (To Phoebe) Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras!
Can't work 'em! (He swiftly rips open the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)
Joey: It's not my first time.
Monica: You go back out there, and you seduce her till she cracks!
Chandler: Okay, give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?
Monica: Of course.
Chandler: Oh, you're-you're going?
Phoebe: Umm, not without you, lover. (She slowly walks over to him and is
showcasing her bra.) So, this is my bra.
Chandler: (swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very
happy we're gonna have all the sex.
Phoebe: You should be. I'm very bendy. (Pause) I'm gonna kiss you now.
Chandler: Not if I kiss you first.
Phoebe: Ooh.
Chandler: Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
Phoebe: Here it comes. Our first kiss.
Chandler: Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
Phoebe: And why not?!
Chandler: Because I'm in love with Monica!!
Phoebe: You're-you're what?!
Monica: I love you too, Chandler. (They kiss.)
Monica: Well actually, Ross doesn't.
Chandler: Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
Rachel: You really think it would be that different?
Rachel: Well, things change.
Rachel: Hey, who's this little naked guy?
Ross: That little naked guy would be me.
Rachel: Aww, look at the little thing.
Ross: Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
Chandler: Who are those people?
Ross: Got me.
Monica: Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. (Reads the back) 'Me and the
gang at Java Joe's'. 
Rachel: Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
Monica: Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
Ross: Looks like a fun gang. (They all look at each other and smile)
Joey: Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
Ross: (looking) No-no, that would be me again.
Monica: Hey, you guys!
Phoebe: Hey.
Joey: Hey.
Chandler: So we both finished our vows.
Phoebe: Oh!
Joey: Hey!
Rachel: Oh, can we read them?
Rachel: Okay.
Phoebe: Okay.
Rachel: (To Monica) Monica, will-will you marry me?
Ross: (To Chandler) Oh man, this is hilarious.
Monica: Chandler!!
Chandler: Okay, what do you guys think?
Ross: (quietly) Dude!
Joey: (starting to cry) I have never known love like this.
Chandler: You really like it?
Ross: Dude! How-how did you write this?
Joey: If he goes first he can!
