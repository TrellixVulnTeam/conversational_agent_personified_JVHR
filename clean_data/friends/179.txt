Phoebe: Well, I left my guitar here again.
Monica: Oh, okay. No problem.
Phoebe: Okay. (Monica closes the door, gets the guitar, and then hands it out.)
Monica: Okay.
Phoebe: Oh.
Monica: Here you go.
Phoebe: Okay. 
Monica: Okay.
Monica: What?!
Phoebe: So do you want to hang out or something?
Monica: Phoebe! You kinda caught me at a bad time.
Monica: Yes! Exactly.
Phoebe: Okay. Do you guys want me to play for you?
Monica: (laughs) No. (Closes the door as Chandler walks up.)
Phoebe: You ask an intriguing question Chandler Bing.
Monica: Phoebe, I can explain!
Phoebe: You told me you hate massages!
Phoebe: Oh, it has a name?
Joey: Oh, I love you too.
Doctor: Oh, here is your beautiful baby. Congratulations! 
Rachel: (bursts into the room) Joey! Joey!
Rachel: Come feel this! Come feel my belly!
Rachel: Joey! The baby is kicking for the first time! Will you please come feel
this?!
Joey: Really?!
Rachel: Yes!
Rachel: Oh, okay! (She goes over to him and he feels her belly.)
Joey: Oh my, oh my God!
Joey: Mia Hamm?
Rachel: Mia Hamm!
Rachel: (looking down) Oh-oh!! One hand on the sheet Joe!
Joey: Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry!
Chandler: Hey babe.
Chandler: How about to the street say from the balcony?
Chandler: Okay. How about in that cabinet?
Chandler: How about the closet by the bathroom? (The secret green door by the
bathroom.)
Monica: No reason. I-I keep private things in there.
Monica: Feminine stuff.
Chandler: Fine.
Monica: Thank you! (He tries the door again and Monica glares at him.)
Chandler: (walking casually away) Love you.
Phoebe: (entering) Hello Chandler, lovely day huh? (To Monica) You!
Chandler: Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like
three years. (Phoebe rolls her eyes and walks away and Monica glares at him.) If! I said,
"If it helps!" (Goes to the bedroom.)
Monica: Hey, come on Phoebe, you can understand why this would be weird for me.
Monica: Dinosaurs.
Phoebe: Potato, potaato. 
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?
Joey: A dreamless sleep.
Joey: Well I got stuff going on in here (Rubbing his belly) if you wanna feel.
Joey: Wow! Can I get a copy of that?
Phoebe: (calling from her room) Are you under the sheet?
Monica: Yes. 
Monica: Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good!
Monica: (in a sexy voice) Oh. Oh yeah! Ohhhhh! Ohh! Oh yeah! 
Phoebe: (getting uncomfortable) Okay.
Joey: Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?
Joey: Why not?
Chandler: Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?
Rachel: Really?
Joey: Hey! So?
Joey: So but everything is normal.
Dr. Long: Absolutely.
Rachel: Thank you doctor. (Dr. Long exits.) (To Joey) Oh thank you for being so
nice and calm.
Rachel: But wait you said everything was gonna be okay.
Joey: You sure?!
Joey: (seeing Ross) Oh hey-hey!
Ross: (rushes in) Is everything okay?
Ross: Your page said come to the hospital, what? What was it? What happened?
Joey: Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions.
Rachel: Okay, no uterus, no opinion.
Ross: Oh when you beeped me I was on line at the concession stand at the movie
theater.
Rachel: Oh you went to the movies by yourself?
Rachel: Oh, I gotta go back in there.
Rachel: I-I forgot my underwear. (Ross lets her go.)
Ross: (To Joey) So, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.
Joey: Oh uh, hey. Not as good as this guy! (Grabs Ross around the shoulders.) He
brought Twizlers!
Chandler: There has got to be a way!
Joey: Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?
Joey: Then why do you throw like one?
Chandler: Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.
Joey: Sure. "Monica."
Joey: Yeah.
Chandler: Okay. (They switch places and Chandler gets out a credit card.) So uh,
Ross is kinda bummed huh?
Monica: Hey.
Phoebe: Hey.
Monica: I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing. That massage felt so good!
Phoebe: No-no, I got that.
Monica: So umm, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?
Monica: Okay.
Phoebe: I mean $500.
Monica: What?
Phoebe: 600.
Phoebe: Oh, you make sex noises when you get massaged!
Monica: What? (Laughs.)
Phoebe: Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to
hurt you and it just spurred you on.
Monica: Really?!
Monica: Are you sure?
Phoebe: Yes.
Monica: I guess.
Rachel: Hey Ross! Check it out! I learned a new trick!
Ross: Hey uh, I brought you some lunch.
Ross: Well yeah!
Rachel: Oh Ross!! (Runs to the bathroom and closes the door.)
Ross: What?! What?! Rach what?!
Ross: I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles.
Joey: Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad.
Joey: Dude relax! It could happen to anyone.
Rachel: (entering) Well, if anyone is keeping score, I no longer eat tuna.
Joey: Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second?
Ross: Yeah.
Joey: Uh, sit down. I wanna talk about our situation.
Rachel: (Gasps) Are you breaking up with us?
Rachel: Yeah?
Joey: Maybe you two should live together.
Rachel: Are you asking me to move out? Do you not want me here?
Ross: No I-I-I would love to be around for you and the baby. And we-we can just
try it like on a temporary basis.
Rachel: But Ross, its you and me!
Joey: All right now, so? What do you think?
Joey: Well, I was due.
Ross: Really?
Rachel: Yeah.
Monica: (entering) (Gasps) How did you get in there?!
Chandler: I married Fred Sanford!
Chandler: Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around
can we, can we share the closet.
Chandler: Hey.
Joey: Hey.
Chandler: Are you okay?
Monica: Ohhh.
Monica: Ohh. Oh! Ohh!
Phoebe: Come on more!
Monica: Oh God!
Monica: Oh yeah right there!
Phoebe: You want it there? You take it there baby!
Monica: Uh Phoebe?
