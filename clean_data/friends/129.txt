Joey: Hey!
Ross: Hey!
Joey: Listen, do you guys think I have a chance with Janine?
Monica: Honey, we have been through this before!
Monica: You serious?!
Monica: Really?!
Ross: You kissed her.
Joey: Oh we kissed it up real nice.
Chandler: So you kissed her, so what happened after that?
Joey: I came over here to tell you guys.
Janine: I gotta go.
Joey: Okay. (They kiss.)
Joey: Okay. (They kiss.)
Janine: (to Monica and Rachel) Bye.
Monica: Bye. (Janine exits.)
Monica: I am so glad you said cooks.
Rachel: I know.
Chandler: (entering) Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell the
post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff.
(Hands her all of her bills and stuff.)
Rachel: Oh-oh, Pottery Barn! (Grabs the aforementioned catalog and holds
the rest back out to Chandler.) You can throw the rest away.
Rachel: Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered. (Shows
her the picture.)
Monica: You got it from Pottery Barn?!
Chandler: A pharmacist. (Rachel mocks him.)
Monica: Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.
Joey: I hate Pottery Barn too. They kicked me out of there just because I
sat on a bed!
Chandler: You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
Joey: (indignant) I was tired!
Rachel: Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!
Monica: Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should
have a history, a story behind it.
Rachel: Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way
from the White Plains store.
Joey: Hey! I made that for her!
Chandler: You made pottery?
Joey: Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.
Monica: I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking
for a couple to go out with and now we have one!
Janine: I had so much fun tonight, and what a great restaurant.
Monica: Yeah.
Janine: Oh that would be great!
Joey: Oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine.
Joey: Nope-op! I insist! (He hugs Chandler again and whispers to him.) You get
the wine right?
Chandler: Yeah all right. (They part.) Okay, good night guys.
Joey: See ya tomorrow!
Monica: Tomorrow!
Janine: How are we gonna get out of that one?
Joey: What?
Joey: Blah?!
Joey: I guess.
Janine: Thank you. (They kiss.)
Phoebe: Hey!
Rachel: Hey!
Phoebe: (sees the table) Ooh, what a great table! Where-where did you get it?
Rachel: Guess!
Phoebe: Umm, a flea market?
Rachel: Ohh, yes.
Rachel: Almost.
Phoebe: How much was it?
Rachel: It was only 500 bucks.
Phoebe: 500 bucks at a flea market?!
Phoebe: Oh no.
Phoebe: A dollar?
Rachel: And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars.
Phoebe: Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing.
Rachel: Yeah.
Phoebe: Well, what period is it from?
Rachel: Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.
Phoebe: (gasps) White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place.
Ross: Hey!
Rachel: (seeing his new table) Ohh! Oh my God!
Ross: You like it? 
Rachel: Oh no!
Ross: Why did you do that?
Rachel: Because she hates Pottery Barn.
Ross: She hates Pottery Barn?!!
Rachel: Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!
Phoebe: (entering) Hey!
Rachel: Hey!
Ross: Hey!
Ross: Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it? 
Phoebe: Sure!
Rachel: He got it a flea market!
Phoebe: You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen
the purse strings a little.
Monica: Hey!
Joey: Hi!
Monica: The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.
Monica: What happened to Janine?
Janine: Bye. (Exits)
Joey: No-no, she really is sick!
Chandler: Then why-why is she going to a play?!
Monica: Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!
Chandler: Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!
Joey: Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are
too loud.
Monica: (loudly) What?!! (Quietly) What?
Chandler: So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was
lying to our faces?!
Monica: Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could
not have been nicer to her!
Chandler: And I am not blah, I am a hoot!
Monica: Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.
Chandler: Okay.
Monica: (from the hallway) I do not like that woman!
Joey: (shouting) I can hear you!
Monica: I am loud!
All: Aww! (They all laugh.)
Phoebe: Oh sure! (She goes to take her feet off, but drags the sheet with her
which spills the wine.) Noo!
Rachel: Ohh!!
Ross: My apothecary table!!!
Phoebe: What?!
Rachel: Noooooo!! (Phoebe lifts up the sheet to discover the exact same
apothecary table they have.) 
Phoebe: Ross, where did you get this?!
Ross: I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!
Rachel: Oh my God, Phoebe, Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our
antique!
Rachel: Oh yes.
Ross: Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for
wrecking my sheet by the way.
Chandler: Okay, one more time.
Monica: Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?
Chandler: Perfect decibel.
Monica: (loudly) I know!!!
Joey: (entering) Hey!
Chandler: Hey.
Joey: So uh, what are you guys doing?
Joey: Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I
came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.
Monica: We owe you?!
Rachel: I know, I know. I went a little crazy.
Ross: A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that!
The ornamental bird cage! Large!
Phoebe: (entering) Hey!
Rachel: Hey.
Phoebe: (sees Ross) Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early
Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.
Ross: (glaring at Rachel) Fascinating.
Phoebe: (gasps) Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!
Rachel: Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial
times.
Phoebe: Ah!
Ross: Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other
time periods Rachel? (She glares at him.)
Phoebe: No! I do want to!
Rachel: Oh, she does want to.
Ross: She does want to.
Phoebe: Yeah!
Phoebe: Well at least I got these sheets for Ross.
Rachel: Yeah.
Phoebe: Uck, look at this! Pottery Barn, yuck!
Phoebe: Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh
my God!
Rachel: Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.
Rachel: (gets it) Oh. Yes! I would so move out!
Phoebe: But at least the apothecary table is real.
Janine: So we can go out again?
Chandler: Oh yeah!
Monica: Absolutely!
Janine: Oh good.
Joey: Oh well then, good night!
Monica: Good night! (They go into their respective apartments.)
Janine: We have got to move!
Joey: All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! (To Chandler and
Monica) You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine! (They start to leave.)
Janine: Okay. Okay. Would, would it help if I went over and apologized?
Joey: Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah. (He opens the door for her
and she exits into the hallway.)
Monica: What did I tell you about the hall?!
Monica: Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too.
Janine: Great.
Janine: Me too.
Monica: Okay.
Monica: Bye. (Leaves to resume her garbage removal task.)
Janine: Wait! (Janine pauses, then runs down the stairs.)
Chandler: Did you hear that?
Joey: Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?
Joey: Yeah! (They head downstairs.)
Ross: Hey!
Chandler: Hey so, did uh, did she move out?
Joey: Pretty much, yeah.
Monica: I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.
Chandler: You okay?
Joey: What?
