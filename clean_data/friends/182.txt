Rachel: Joey? Are you in there?
Monica: Joey, you have to talk to her!
Rachel: Hey!
Chandler: Hey!
Monica: Hey Rachel!
Rachel: Is Joey here?
Rachel: Well, at least you make each other laugh.
Monica: We were playing a game.
Rachel: Ew, was Chandler naked? Sort of like a, like a ring toss kind of
situation?
Monica: Sure.
Chandler: What?! No! No!
Monica: (To Joey) Okay, did you hear that?
Monica: Honey, you gotta talk to her.
Joey: All right so, so what do I do?
Phoebe: Okay. (Looks at the leaves.) Ooh, I see a ladder. (Checks the book)
Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.
Phoebe: Okay. (Reads the leaves) Umm, oh! Okay, I see a circle.
Rachel: Ah.
Rachel: Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.
Chandler: What does yours say Pheebs?
Monica: You mean your pink shirt?
Ross: Faded salmon color.
Rachel: Well just ask Mona to give it back!
Chandler: Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute!
(Looking at his tea.) Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does that
mean?
Rachel: Hi!
Joey: Hey.
Rachel: Hi.
Joey: Hi.
Monica: Tea gives Phoebe the trots.
Monica: Honey, what is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Kat Stevens case?
Monica: Okay, where is the Kat Stevens CD?
Chandler: In the James Taylor case.
Monica: Where is the James Taylor CD?
Rachel: Oh my God!! You guys have such problems!! I feel so terrible for you!
Rachel: Oh yeah. That makes sense.
Rachel: Ooh, I can do that.
Monica: Good. (To Chandler) Uh honey, the Miami Vice soundtrack? Really?
Joey: (entering) Hey!
Rachel: Hi.
Rachel: What?
Joey: Yeah?
Rachel: Yeah, and umm my baby.
Joey: Yeah?
Rachel: My boss wants to buy my baby!
Joey: What?! Oh my-oh my God!
Joey: What he wants to buy your baby?!
Rachel: Can you believe that?!
Joey: Okay, how did this even happen?
Joey: Man! When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby I figured
it was something about maternity leave.
Phoebe: Oh hello.
Phoebe: Well, maybe we will. (Starts to walk away.) Oh! (She turns around and
the exchange information.)
Mona: (entering, with her date) I am so sorry I spilled wine all over your
shirt.
Chandler: Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies
of the Annie soundtrack.
Monica: Honey, both yours.
Rachel: (entering) Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!
Monica: Yeah? The work problem?
Rachel: Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.
Chandler: What problem did you tell him you had?
Joey: Do you think you can just buy my friends baby?!
Jim: Someone does. Me.
Phoebe: Oh, witty banter. Well done.
Jim: So, tell me a little bit about yourself.
Jim: Do you like to party?
Phoebe: I-I-I like, I like parties.
Phoebe: Yeah I guess, a little.
Phoebe: Oh stop it.
Jim: And your breasts! Hmm!!!
Jim: All right.
Phoebe: Okay.
Jim: I write erotic novels, for children.
Phoebe: What?!
Phoebe: Oh my God!
Jim: Oh also, you might be interested to know that I have a Ph.D.
Phoebe: Wow! You do?
Phoebe: All right. (Gets up and walks out.)
Joey: (entering) Hey!
Rachel: Hey! Oh Joey, honey listen, thank you for talking to my yesterday about
that thing with my boss. That really meant a lot.
Rachel: (worried) What?
Rachel: What?!
Joey: What?! Why?!
Monica: You said your boss wants to buy your baby?!
Chandler: You can always sell your baby.
Joey: You lied to me!
Rachel: Well, she told me too! (Points to Monica and Joey glares at her.)
Monica: Chandler has two copies of Annie!
Mona: (seeing Ross) Oh my God! Ross!!!
Ross: Hello!!
Mona: Ross, what are you doing?!
Ross: Not touching myself if that makes anyone less uncomfortable.
Rachel: Morning. You wanted to see me?
Rachel: Yeah. (Motions for him to continue.)
Rachel: Oh God.
Rachel: Well, as long as we are clear about that. (Exits smugly.)
Phoebe: Oh there it is.
Monica: What?!
Phoebe: Yeah, we both can. And we both will.
Phoebe: Okay.
Phoebe: What?
Guy: Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?
Monica: (to the clerk) Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?
Rachel: Hi.
Joey: So? What-what-what happened?
Rachel: Chandler, can you give us a minute?
Rachel: Yeah.
Joey: I know. I know.
Rachel: Yeah I know! I miss that.
