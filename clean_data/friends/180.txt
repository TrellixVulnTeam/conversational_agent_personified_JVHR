Phoebe: Oh! Hey, Rach!
Phoebe: Oh, you, too.
Phoebe: Okay.
Joey: Bye.
Phoebe: (sighs) Honey, I wish you would get over her. I hate seeing you like this.
Is there anything I can do for you? Do you want to look down my top?
Joey: Thanks. But maybe later.
Phoebe: Oh, Gunther, can I get a scone?
Gunther: (to Joey) You want anything?
Gunther: We have red bagels.
Joey: Oh, okay. 
Phoebe: So, how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together?
Phoebe: All right. Oh! Shoot! Oh shoot! Uh, Rachel wanted to see this tape!
Ross: What is it?
Phoebe: Oh, Monica, grow up!
Monica: Not really.
Ross: (quietly) The red one.
Phoebe: He-hee!
Joey: Hey! A dog! Hi! Who, you got to admit, looks a lot like Jane.
Phoebe: This is the happiest dog in the world. I borrowed him from my friend Wendy.
Now, you can only keep him until he cheers you up. And he will cheer you up!
Man on TV: Yeah, just relax.
Chandler: I love you, St. Valentine.
Man on TV: Now, push!
Chandler: Worst porn ever! Worst porn ever! (Chandler starts to press buttons on
the remote control, frantically.)
Chandler: I am trying!
Joey: (looking at the ball the dog brought back) Did I just throw this?
Rachel: (entering) Hi.
Joey: Hi.
Rachel: I accidentally packed these with my stuff. (looks at the dog and gasps) Who
is this?
Monica: (entering from her bedroom) So what do you think? (referring to her outfit)
Chandler: (pointing at the video) Why did you get me this?
Monica: What is it?
Chandler: Well, remember the first time we saw Jaws?
Monica: Mm-hmm.
Chandler: How long it took to go back in the water?
Monica: Oh! Oh, my God! No wonder my mother hates me!
Mona: Hi!
Ross: Hey! (they hug) So, how was Atlantic City?
Mona: Good.
Ross: Yeah?
Mona: I brought you back a present.
Ross: I do too! I missed you!
Mona: I missed you, too! So, how was your week?
Ross: Oh, it was good! It was good. Actually, the baby started kicking!
Mona: How exciting!
Mona: Oh no.
Mona: (laughing) Yeah right!
Ross: What?
Ross: (with his mouth full) Just a second! (he fake laughs, but turns his head and
starts to break down)
Phoebe: How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?
Ross: Ever?!
Phoebe: (entering) Hey!
Joey: Hey.
Joey: No.
Phoebe: Will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment.
Joey: Yeah, sure. Go ahead. (pause) Oh, me, right!
Joey: Nothing. We just talked about stuff.
Phoebe: What stuff?
Joey: Rachel stuff.
Rachel: Ross, we actually watched the documentary together.
Rachel: Ooh! My Chinese food! Let me get my cash! (runs to her room to get her
money)
Rachel: (entering) Oh, hey, Mona!
Ross: I have no idea!
Mona: Seriously, what is she doing?
Mona: Why?
Ross: I know.
Mona: Oh, my God! She has food delivered here?
Mona: You got another ex-wife back there?
Ross: (fakes a laugh) Please start drinking! (exits)
Rachel: (as Ross enters with a present) But, but, Mona, I live here.
Monica: How long has it been this time?
Chandler: 90 seconds.
Chandler: I can do that.
Monica: Okay.
Monica: Oh, thank God!
Chandler: Oh, I know!
Monica: Come in!
Monica: Oh, my God.
Chandler: Poor Ross.
Chandler: Oh, great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he
closes the drapes!
Rachel: Why? You saw it? Is it scary?
Monica: No, but I will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you!
Chandler: (with his arm all the way under the cushion, moving it around) This
reminds me of a very specific part of the tape. (Chandler puts the tape in, and they all
sit down) Okay, here we go.
Rachel: Okay. (watching the tape) Ooh, my! (Rachel jumps when the woman starts
screaming) Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?!
Chandler: Why have I seen this thing three times?!
Rachel: Oh, my God!
Chandler: Wait, you guys, look!
Rachel: What? Did her ass explode?!
Monica: Oh, look at those little fingers and toes!
Chandler: And look how happy the mom is now!
Ross: Hey, hey, man!
Joey: Sort of.
Ross: Really?!
Ross: Oh, sorry. Well, look, maybe I can help you with it.
Ross: Anyway, so, uh, so what is it?
Joey: No!
Ross: I knew it. So, is she someone from work?
Joey: Yes.
Ross: Well, uh, does she like you?
Ross: Why not?
Ross: Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.
Ross: Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen
to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.
Joey: Oh, yeah.
Man on TV: Anything?
