Rachel: Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!
Monica: Oh my God!
Phoebe: Wow!
Joey: (To Ross) What is the matter with you?!
Phoebe: No! Barry and Mindy.
Rachel: Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best
friend.
Rachel: Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her
instead of me.
Monica: Why did they get divorced?
Phoebe: Which time?
Chandler: Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
Chandler: Sure I would!
All: (simultaneously) Oh yeah! Come on! Yeah right!
Ross: No, I just think Monica was that fat.
Phoebe: What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?
Ross: What?!
Rachel: Merrill Lynch?
Phoebe: Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a
knack for stocks.
Ross: (recognizing her) Oh my God! Rachel Green?
Rachel: (gasps) Rob Tillman!
Ross: No, no-no, Ross Geller.
Ross: Yeah. Right.
Rachel: Wow! How are you?!
Rachel: Ohh! Me too!
Rachel: Ohh, I would love too.
Rachel: Ohh! Okay!
Ross: Come on! (They start to leave.)
Rachel: (laughs) Oh yeah? Okay.
Ross: (putting the magazine back and holding the money for it) Okay.
Joey: So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?
Monica: Thanks.
Joey: (not impressed) Wow!!
Joey: Oh dear God, let me think. (Starts to sarcastically think about it.)
Chandler: (entering, depressed) Hey.
Joey: Hey.
Chandler: Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was
funny, just not "Archie Comic funny."
Monica: Okay.
Monica: Bye.
Joey: Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me
to give you some money?
Chandler: Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
Joey: Really?
Chandler: Ehh.
Monica: No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of
your fan mail and stuff!
Chandler: I could use the money; it could give me time to write.
Joey: Oh right great! Welcome aboard!
Chandler: Okay!
Chandler: All right!
Phoebe: (entering) Hey!
Monica: Hey Phoebe! Guess what?
Phoebe: What?
Monica: Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant!
Ross: Hey Mon! 
Monica: Hey!
Ross: Mon, look who I ran into! (Gestures towards Rachel.)
Monica: (gets up and gasps) Oh my God! Rachel!! (Rachel is stunned to see that
her long lost friend is still fat.) (Monica goes over and gives Rachel a big bear hug,
which is quite easy for her.) You look terrific!
Monica: You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds!
Ross: And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler. (Points to him.)
Chandler: Hey.
Rachel: Oh yeah.
Phoebe: Hi!
Rachel: (interrupting him and seeing Joey) Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days
of Our Lives, just walked in here!
Rachel: (stunned) You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?
Ross: (To Rachel) Hey-hey, or I could bring my keyboard over here
sometime!
Monica: (getting up) Joey!
Joey: (holding a plate of what looks like Rice Crispies Treats) I know,
here-here!! (Hands her the plate.)
Monica: Ohhh! (Takes the plate.) No! This is my friend Rachel, we went to High
School together.
Rachel: Ah!
Monica: No.
Joey: (entering) Hey there you are!
Chandler: (reading the list) Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins.
Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.
Chandler: What?
Phoebe: No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13
million dollars.
Chandler: But the Kit-Kats are all right?!
Monica: What?!
Chandler: Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?! 
Phoebe: Oh, if I were, would-would I have shooting pains up and down my left
arm?
Monica: Yes!!
Monica: Oh my God!
Phoebe: Still going through that dry spell with Carol?
Ross: Yeah.
Phoebe: How long has it been since you had sex?
Phoebe: That is.
Phoebe: Maybe you need to spice things up a little.
Ross: What-what do you mean?
Ross: Oh.
Ross: Wow!
Ross: Okay, I think I got it.
Joey: (entering) Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right?
Joey: Oh great. (Starts to go in.) (To Chandler) Hey! Go take off those pants,
they look ready!
Rachel: Wow! This is so amazing! What else? What else?
Joey: Well, that is a large piece of television equipment. (Points at a
large piece of television equipment as an old man walks by.) And uh that is an old
man! Hey old man!
Rachel: Hey!
Joey: All righty, what do you say we head back to my place?
Joey: Okay, you watch too much TV.
Chandler: Yeah?
Rachel: Yeah sure, iced tea would be great.
Joey: (To Chandler) Iced tea.
Chandler: Okay, anything for you sir?
Joey: (To Rachel) Did I not just tell him?
Rachel: (mouthing it to him) Yes, you did.
Ross: So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower
there.
Carol: Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.
Ross: Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things
up a little.
Carol: What do you mean?
Ben: (entering) Dad!! (Runs and hugs him.)
Ben: Yay! (Runs off.)
Carol: Like what?
Carol: (quickly) I love that idea!
Chandler: Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!
Chandler: Aww.
Chandler: You wanna share it?
Monica: Okay!!
Joey: Fresh squeezed orange juice, with pulp! Just the way you like it.
Chandler: Aww, thanks man. (They hug.)
Monica: Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics!
Joey: Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!
Rachel: Oh Mon, listen I have to ask! Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to
his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?
Monica: Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!
Rachel: Oh what do you know? Virgin!
Monica: Phoebe, why is smoke coming out of the bathroom?!
Phoebe: Oh yeah, the doctor said that could be one of the side effects. 
Monica: Phoebe! Put that cigarette out!
Monica: Put it out!!
Ross: Come on. (Helps her into bed as her phone rings.) I got it.
Phoebe: Oh, give it to me.
Ross: I got it!
Phoebe: Give it!
Phoebe: Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?!
Ross: J-j-just relax, nobody yelled. Jack just was calling to make sure that you
were getting better.
Phoebe: Thank God.
Rachel: (very relived) Oh! Thank God!
Hope: (sleepily) Drake!
Hope: Oh Drake.
Carol: Oh, me too.
Ross: Yeah. Right. Save it. I can do that. (Gets up and does a little kara-tay.)
Ross: Hey, Pheebs!
Phoebe: Hey.
Monica: (handing her a cup) Here you go sweetie.
Phoebe: What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!
Monica: But, I put some honey in it.
Chandler: No, the doctors say it may kill her.
Phoebe: What are you two girls whispering about over there?!
Chandler: (To Ross) But I think we should tell her.
Ross: Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you
should start think about getting a different job.
Phoebe: Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here!
(Points at Ross.)
Monica: Well, you used to like playing the guitar.
Phoebe: Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!
Rachel: Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!! (Laughs and finishes her drink.)
Rachel: Umm, can I use your bathroom?
Rachel: Yeah, it sure is!
Dr. Roger: They have parasites?
Monica: No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac. 
Dr. Roger: What people?
Monica: People! People say it! Come here! (She grabs him and kisses him.)
Dr. Roger: So oysters, huh?
Monica: Okay! (They kiss again and his beeper goes off.) Ohhh no!
Carol: Looks like it.
Carol: (jumping up to get it) I got it!
Ross: Okay.
Susan: Hey! (They hug.)
Carol: Thank you so much for coming.
Carol: Thank you so much.
Ross: How hot is this?!
Monica: Yeah, me too.
Chandler: Okay.
Chandler: What was tonight?
Chandler: Okay. (Pause.) What was tonight?
Chandler: With Roger? (Monica shyly looks away.) Not just with Roger?! (Monica
shrugs.) Oh my God!
Monica: How many?
Chandler: Nine.
Monica: I was just waiting for the perfect guy.
Chandler: Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect
guy?
Chandler: No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen
for you.
Monica: Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me?
Chandler: Okay. (They both realize what he just said.)
Monica: I was kidding.
Chandler: So was I.
Joey: Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I
pretty much have to make it up on my own.
Joey: Yeah you did.
Rachel: Okay. (She climbs back onto the couch.) 
Joey: Here you go. Let me ask you a question.
Rachel: Yeah?
Joey: When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?
Joey: Come, come here. 
Monica: No! (They both laugh.) Oyster?
Chandler: I do like that.
Chandler: Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for
tonight, right?
Monica: Absolutely! It would just be one friend (Points at Chandler) helping out
another friend. (Points at herself.)
Monica: Noo!! Okay!!
Chandler: Okay! (They both get up.)
Monica: Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?
Chandler: I have some moves.
Monica: What if I turn out the lights? (Runs to shut them off.)
Chandler: Okay!
Chandler: Oh yeah.
Monica: Chandler?
Chandler: (sexily) Yeah?
Chandler: Oh my God!
Chandler: Oh, okay! (He rolls over to do that again.)
Joey: (entering) Morning!
Rachel: (wakes up suddenly and realizes where she is) Oh right.
Joey: Yeah.
Joey: Well he actually saw you a little bit too.
Joey: No! No! No, not after seeing that.
Joey: Wh-why?
Rachel: The ring from the cave, yeah.
Rachel: (seeing the ring and gasping) Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!
Joey: Look, do you want the ring or not?!
Rachel: Yeah!
Ross: Hey!
Joey: Hey!
Joey: All right!
Joey: You?

Joey: All right! So, was it amazing?
Ross: It was, it was okay.
Ross: Oh-oh, absolutely!
Joey: But you got to be with both of them, right?
Ross: Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.
Joey: Not the other one?
Ross: No, she kept kicking me away!
Ross: No!
Joey: Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff, right?

Arthur: Hey Pheebs! 
Phoebe: Hey!

Phoebe: Jack!! Hey!
Jack: What are you doing here?
Phoebe: All better! Back to work! Except this clown from research told me I was
fired. He should do his research, huh?
Jack: Well, you were fired.
Phoebe: Nu-uh!
Jack: I told that guy who answered your phone.
Jack: You lost 13 million dollars.
Jack: Are you all right?
Jack: What?!
Jack: Take it easy. (Sits her down.)
Woman: Wow! Well, welcome back!
Phoebe: Yeah.
Rachel: Hi Ross!
Ross: Hey Rachel.
Rachel: Is Joey Tribbiani here?
Ross: Umm, no.
Ross: Yeah.
Rachel: Sit down! 
Ross: Okay. (He does so.) 
Rachel: No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of
marriage?
Rachel: Aw what are you?! A detective?
Ross: Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their
marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives
engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she
barely knows from the gym!
Rachel: Who are these men?
Ross: Men. I guy I know.
Rachel: Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is (whispers)
gay.
Rachel: Good day for married people huh?
Ross: Try telling my wife that.
Chandler: (sticking his head in the door) Okay to come in?
Monica: Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.
Chandler: Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?
Monica: What?!
Monica: Why would you do that?
Monica: Really?
Monica: Chandler!
Chandler: No, there were two.
Monica: Including me?
Chandler: Oh yeah.
