Joey: I know. Ross is getting married.
Chandler: Phoebe is, making people.
Chandler: And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even
know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something.
Okay? Something huge!
Joey: (snaps his fingers) We could climb Mt. Everest!
Chandler: No-no, not something stupid, something huge.
Joey: No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing
everyday! We could totally do that!
Joey: Yeah!
Phoebe: (entering) Hey!
Joey: Hey!
Chandler: Yeah baby!
Joey: We could get that Everest video though.
Chandler: Yeeeeahhhh.
Joey: Yeah. Yeah.
Joey: Yeah we are!
Emily: So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: Sure. Why not?
Emily: Really?
Ross: Yeah?
Ross: Yeah sure.
Emily: Earl Grey?
Ross: Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want.
Ross: I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married
again!
Chandler: And I just want a million dollars! (He extends his hand hopefully.)
Monica: Rachel?!
Rachel: Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and
then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
Monica: Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (To
Rachel) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my
brother Ross? 
Rachel: Hi, sure!
Ross: Hi. 
Ross: You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a,
um, major crush on you.
Rachel: I knew.
Ross: You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky
older brother.
Rachel: I did.
Rachel: Yeah, maybe...
Ross: Okay... okay, maybe I will...
Rachel: Really?
Ross: I do.
Rachel: Oh Ross, you're so great. [she playfully rubs his head and gets up]
Joey: It's never gonna happen.
Ross: Hey, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as..
more of a general wondering... ment.
Rachel: Okay.
Ross: Okay. Umm, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
Rachel: Ohhh!!!! [looking at something behind Ross]
Ross: Yes, yes, that's right...
Rachel: Oh, look at the little cat! [a small kitten is on the roof behind Ross]
Look at it!
Ross: What? [the cat jumps on his shoulders] Ow!
Rachel: All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to
take me with it! 
Rachel: (to Ross) Yes! Did you see that?
Ross: You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
Rachel: I could not have done this without you.
Ross: Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? (Ross turns and bangs his head on
an open dryer door.) I'm fine, I'm fine.
Ross: You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
Rachel: (hurt) What?
Ross: I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
Rachel: Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy
for me to see you with Julie?
Ross: The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm
with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
Rachel: Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.
Ross: Fine.
Rachel: 'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
Ross: Good.
Rachel: Good. (Ross leaves)
Rachel: Well neither do I!
Ross: Is this about Mark?
Rachel: (shocked) Oh my God.
Rachel: No. (Ross is standing in the doorway.) A break from us.
Ross: Yeah! 
Chloe: Good luck, with your girlfriend. 
Ross: Oh, thank you. (She goes to kiss him, but he holds her coat up between
their faces to stop her.) Hey, hey. (opens the door, sees Rachel, and hides Chloe behind
the door) Rachel!!!!
Rachel: Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
Ross: Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
Rachel: So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
Ross: Yes, you can, very much.
Ross: (seeing the thumbs up) Ahhhh!! (Hugs Rachel tighter.)
Rachel: (opening the door) Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here! 
Ross: No!!
Rachel: Just get out! Now!!
Ross: No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
Rachel: Okay! All right! How was she?
Chandler: Uh-oh.
Ross: What?
Rachel: Was she good?
Ross: She was...
Joey: Awful! Horrible!
Chandler: She was not good. Not good.
Joey: She was nothing compared to you.
Ross: She, she was different.
Joey: Ewwwww!
Chandler: Uh-oh.
Rachel: Good different?
Ross: Nobody likes change.
Ross: What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Ross: WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
Rachel: You seem to really like her.
Ross: You think?
Rachel: Yeah.
Chandler: (entering) Hello!
Joey: Hey!
Monica: Hey!
Chandler: (sarcastic) Noo.
Monica: I never knew that either.
Joey: Heyyy. (They all try and hide their invitations.)
Rachel: Yeah.
Rachel: Who's this from?
Chandler: Oh, that's Ross's. 
Rachel: Oh... (opens it and sees it is a pin) Oh my God. He remembered.
Phoebe: Remembered what?
Rachel: It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw
this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I
was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
Phoebe: Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
Monica: I can't believe he did this.
Chandler: Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with
Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
Rachel: What did you just say?
Chandler: (stuttering incoherently) F-hah.... flennin....
Rachel: Oh.... my God.
Julie: Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.
Ross: But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess
who's in charge of the dig. 
Rachel: Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick-
you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
Ross: Oh, that is so sweet.(listens) No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two,
three.(He doesn't hang up and motions for Rachel to be quiet.) Well you didn't hang up
either. 
Rachel: (on phone) Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um,
everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat...(cut)...I
am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure. (She hangs up
and tosses phone in the ice bucket.)
Ross: Rach, I got a message from you.
Rachel: Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone
Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . . (She jumps the couch and
lands on Ross's back, finally getting the phone from him. Ross has a confused expression
on his face.)
Ross: You're over me?
Rachel: Ohhhhhhhh God. (climbs off his back)
Ross: Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?
Rachel: Ohh, ohh.
Ross: When, when were you... under me?
Rachel: Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
Ross: OK, I need to lie down. 
Joey: He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.
Rachel: Really?
Ross: Really. It's always been you, Rach.
Rachel: Oh, god.
Ross: I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
Rachel: Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight.
Rachel: Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.
Ross: What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
Rachel: Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!
Ross: You still love me?
Rachel: Noo.
Ross: What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?
Ross: What?!
Rachel: I just, I feel, I-I just...
Ross: (starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behind
it)
Chandler: I KNEW IT!!!!
Rachel: Oh my God.
Monica: You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.
Rachel: Oh.
Ross: You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this.
All: Oh yeah we do. C'mon.
Monica: Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.
Chandler: Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
Monica: Oh, dad, turn it off.
Joey: Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.
Rachel: I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too
late.
Monica: If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
All: No, no, no.
Ross: OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright.
Ross: (walks down the stairs and grabs the flowers out of the vase on
the endtable) Okay dad.
Monica: (to Ross) I can't believe you did that.
Ross: Yeah, well.
Phoebe: See, he's her lobster.
Chandler: Well, You could, but... probably just the one
time.
Joey: I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our
hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!
Chandler: If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.
Joey: Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
