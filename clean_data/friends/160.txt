Phoebe: (To Joey) Oh hey! How was your audition?
Phoebe: What are you doing?
Phoebe: Oh! You got it?!
Joey:  Well no, not yet. But the audition went really good.
Monica: What was it for?
Phoebe: The next next?
Joey: (to Monica and Phoebe) They loved me!
Estelle: Yeah, they wanna see you again tomorrow.
Joey: (on phone) Oh my God!
Joey: Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it! (Listens) Oh.
(Listens) Uh, okay uh let me call you back. (Hangs up.)
Joey: They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
Monica: Wow!
Phoebe: Hey, the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?
Ross: A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman
in America.
Monica: Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand? 
Phoebe: Sure.
Monica: I gotta make up the guest bedroom. (To Ross) Hey, Cousin Cassie is
coming to stay with us for a few days.
Ross: Cassie?
Monica: Uh-hmm.
Rachel: (entering) Hi!
Monica: Hey!
Phoebe: Hey!
Rachel: Hey Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second?
Phoebe: Yeah!
Monica: Subtle guys!
Phoebe: What?!
Monica: Okay. Sorry. (She goes into the guest bedroom.)
Rachel: (To Phoebe) Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!
Monica: Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
Monica: No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean, the
chance to star in a movie? Come on!
Phoebe: Well, when can we have this shower?
Rachel: Yesterday!
Phoebe: Rachel, calm down!
Phoebe: (grabs and shakes Rachel) Just calm down woman!
Rachel: Phoebe, I already, I already did.
Phoebe: Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little.
Rachel: Okay. Okay. (They sit down.) I think we can do this if we just get
organized. All right? We have two days to plan this party. We just need to make fast
decisions! Okay? All right, where are we gonna have it?
Phoebe: Uh, here. What time?
Phoebe: Finger sandwiches and tea.
Rachel: Ooh great! Very Monica.
Phoebe: And chili!
Rachel: Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons?
Phoebe: Both!
Phoebe: Neither.
Rachel: Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?
Phoebe: Lusts of the flesh.
Rachel: (pause) What?
Chandler: Hey!
Monica: Hey!
Monica: Oh boy, me too!
Monica: Yeah?
Chandler: Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and
domineering?!
Monica: The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
Chandler: Well, get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
Monica: Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
Cassie: I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
Chandler: (transfixed) Hi! Nice to meet you!
Cassie: Nice to meet you too.
Monica: So, are you ready to go?
Cassie: Yeah.
Monica: (catching him) Chandler!
Monica: (To Ross) Cassie needs to stay at your place.
Monica: You were staring about eight inches south of there.
Ross: Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even
look like now.
Monica: She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
Chandler: Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
Monica: Wafer thin ice!
Joey: Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?
Joey: Yes!
Joey: No. What?
Joey:  Barmitsvahed?
Joey: Nope.
Monica: But you are?
Joey: Yep.
Joey: I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet
the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
Monica: Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!
Monica: Unless!
Joey: Unless what?
Monica: Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.
Joey: Like what?
Monica: (entering) Hey!
Phoebe: Hey!
Rachel: Have at it.
Monica: I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!
(Runs out.)
Phoebe: Uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party. (Holds up $40.)
Ross: (shocked at her beauty) Cassie?!
Cassie: Hey Ross!
Ross: Hey!
Cassie: Ah yeah, sorry about that.
Ross: Oh.
Cassie: Oh my God! You do a great Chandler!
Ross: Uh-huh. Yeah, I-I have a knack for impressions.
Cassie: Well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me.
Ross: (quietly) Thank God.
Cassie: I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented
that beach house together.
Cassie: It took you that long to figure it out, huh?
Phoebe: Hi!
Woman: Hi!
Phoebe: How are you? (The woman nods) Good. (She goes over to another couple of
women.) Hi, thanks for coming.
Woman: Oh thank you.
Woman: No.
Phoebe: Okay. (Goes over to Rachel.) Hey Rach?
Rachel: Yeah?
Phoebe: Who the hell are all these people?
Woman: I was her accountant four years ago.
Rachel: Ohhhh!
Woman: So, what time is Monica supposed to get here?
Phoebe: You were supposed to tell her!
Rachel: Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!
Monica: Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to
try on.
Joey: Wow! This looks great!
Monica: Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap. (Points to it.) Umm, this one is
made of bologna. (Points.)
Joey: And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?
Monica: Oh, just until the glue dries.
Joey: Thank God!
Monica: (to a whole group) Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable. 
Joey: Ah.
Joey: Well maybe we just take that one away. (Picks it up and throws it away.)
Joey: Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.
Joey: Ow!
Monica: Toothpick?
Joey: Yeah.
Monica: What are you trying on now?
Joey: The fruit roll up.
Monica: And?
Joey: Delicious.
Monica: Joey!
Joey: Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner!
Monica: What?! Which one?!
Cassie: Hey! What the hell are you doing?! (They sit back up.)
Rachel: Oh Monica, we are so sorry.
Monica: For what?
Rachel: Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
Phoebe: And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
Monica: You al-you already had it?
Phoebe: Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and a bunch of people
came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
Phoebe: We ruined everything.
Rachel: What do you, what do you mean?
Phoebe: Sur-surprise.
Phoebe: Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?
Cassie: Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here.
Cassie: (noticing her) What?
