Chandler: Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one.
Ross: Look, I gotta go pick up Ben. Everything so far sounds great Joey, just
remember to keep it on the mellow side, okay? Just a couple of guys hanging out playing
poker, no-no strippers or anything okay?
Joey: You got it.
Ross: Okay, see ya later.
Chandler: See ya. (Ross exits, and Chandler moves over next to Joey, laughing.)
Have fun planning your mellow bachelor party.
Chandler: He just said, "No strippers."
Joey: Oh, I chose not to hear that.
Monica: Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got! (She shows Rachel
what she bought. She bought a little leather jacket and a little cowboy outfit for the
babies.) Can you believe they make these for little people?
Rachel: Little village people.
Rachel: Oh, that is so sweet!
Monica: I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!
Rachel: Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
Joey: Yeah?
Ross: Good call!
Chandler: Central Perk?
Gunther: (to Ross) Thanks for not marrying Rachel. (He starts to leave.)
Ross: Hey-hey, what are those?
Ross: Wow! Yeah!
Chandler: (banging on the bottle again) Okay, okay, a little announcement, I
just want everyone to know that the position of my best man is still open! And uh, (to the
stripper) so is the position of the bride.
Ross: Smooth man. Yeah, you got some chilie on your neck. (Chandler checks and
runs into the bathroom.) Well, I just want to say, thanks everyone, this-this was great.
And hey! See you guys Monday morning. (They museum geeks wave at him.) Thanks Joey.
Ross: Oh, thanks! (Takes it and throws it back into the box and leaves.)
Joey: Yeah!
Joey: Oh yeah-yeah. And I got the duck totally trained. Watch this. Stare at the
wall. (The duck complies.) Hardly move. (The duck complies.) Be white. (The duck
complies.)
Joey: Oh unless you uh, you wanna hang around.
Chandler: (opening the door) What?
Joey: The ring is gone!
Chandler: You slept with the stripper?
Joey: Of course!! (Shrugs.)
Phoebe: Hi, guys.
Monica: Hi Phoebe.
Monica: Hormones.
Phoebe: Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet.
(She goes to hug them and they both flinch, thinking that Phoebe is about to attack them.)
Phoebe: Oh!
Phoebe: Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street
and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.
Rachel: Well, h-how is this like that?
Phoebe: Alrighty, here come the water works. (Rachel starts crying harder.)
Ross: (entering) Hey guys!
Chandler: Hey!
Ross: Yeah, right!
Ross: That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and
the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
Chandler: So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable? (Gives Joey a little
squeeze.)
Ross: Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride
who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
Joey: (laughs, softly) Yeah, the stripper stole it.
Ross: My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?!
H-how?! How could this all happen?!
Ross: Not on you! On the stripper!
Chandler: Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her
come to my office?
Rachel: Good.
Phoebe: (sets the cup down) Oh! (Grabs her stomach in pain.)
Monica: What?!
Rachel: What?! She made the tea! (Points to Monica.)
Phoebe: Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction.
Rachel: You what?
Monica: Oh my God!
Phoebe: Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that
was definitely one.
Monica: Rachel, get the book! The book!
Rachel: Okay! (Runs and grabs a book and hands it to Monica.) Okay! Here!
Monica: The Bible?!
Ross: Diverse.
Chandler: (to Ross) You be cool. (He opens the door and lets her in as they all
turn there backs on her.)
Chandler: Way to be cool, man.
Joey: There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!
The Guys: Yeah!
Ross: We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
Chandler: Marry me. (Both Ross and Chandler hit him.)
Phoebe: Well, do you see any babies?
Monica: How do you feel?
Monica: Some moms do that.
Phoebe: Yeah, okay.
Rachel: And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!
Phoebe: Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!
Monica: Yeah.
Phoebe: They are gonna love me.
Rachel: Oh!
Phoebe: Thanks you guys! Again.
Monica: Oh, sweetie! (They all hug.)
Phoebe: Just kidding. Ahh!
Rachel: What?!
Monica: Oh my God!
Phoebe: Got cha again, you guys are so easy.
Chandler: He will, Joe.
Joey: Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.

Chandler: What a baby.
Ross: Total wuss!
