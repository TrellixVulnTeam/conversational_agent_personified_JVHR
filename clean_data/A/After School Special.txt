FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT: December 21, 2001
MATT (O.S.): This is unwatchable. It's not even in focus. And geez, look, the boom mike is in the shot. This is really shoddy work.
DEACON (O.S.): Why do they always show the guy's face? It's like, can't we just assume he's enjoying it?
FRED (O.S.): Because they're trying to make us feel like we're better looking than that guy, so we should be able to get chicks as hot as her.
DEACON (O.S.): How the hell do you know?
FRED (O.S.): It's a basic rule of porno.
DEACON (V.O.): It all started on my seventeenth birthday with our usual morning routine: film appreciation.
FRED: Deacon! What are you doing? I was watching that.
DEACON: Come on, let's go. We're going to be late.
DEACON (V.O.) (CONT'D): And when I say film appreciation, I mean film duplication. Fred steals them, Matt copies them, and I sell them.
DEACON (V.O.): Fred's the kind of kid who's basically given up on high school. He figures his glory days are way ahead of him.
FRED: First, I go to Yale, then Harvard law, then when I'm making a hundred grand a year, I'll have a whole stable of hot chicks sitting around topless on my yacht.
MATT: (to Deacon) Will that work?
DEACON: (to Fred) You are a complete moron.
FRED: What?
DEACON (V.O.): Until that big payday, Fred's sex life consists of spanking it.
AMAZING GIRL: That test was sooo hard.
HOT GIRL: We're going to be late. Are you coming?
DEACON (V.O.): Fred averages two to five time a day, depending on how many girls he sees in the hallway.
DEACON (V.O.): Now Matt-- Matt's what you'd call a late bloomer. Secretary of the Audio Visual Club, amateur filmmaker, and complete dork.
FRED: What are you doing?
MATT: All great directors start this way. I'm documenting the essence of high school. Teenagers running to meet their destiny only to find it's just home room. It's very existential.
FRED: So's my balls. See you later.
DEACON (V.O.): In the normal course of things, Matt probably wouldn't even have been our friend, but Fred likes having someone to boss around, and I think Matt's actually pretty cool once you get to know him.
DEACON (CONT'D; V.O.): Well, at least he's got the key to the A/V room.
DEACON: Dirty Darla #7 is a modern classic. This is grade-A porn, my friend. Worth a lot more than twenty dollars.
DORKY FRESHMAN: Sweet.
DEACON (V.O.): People always talk about how tough it is being a teenage girl. I mean, if I have to watch one more TV movie about bulimia or self mutilation or vaginal dryness...
DEACON (CONT'D; V.O.) (CONT'D): I'll tell you what's really hard. Being a seventeen year old boy. Imagine what it's like to have only one thing on your mind all day, every day, but to have absolutely no way of getting it.
DEACON (V.O.): Testosterone is a drug more powerful than heroin. I don't really have any evidence to support that, but the point is, a horny teenage boy will do almost anything for even a glimpse of sex.
BIOLOGY TEACHER: (in the background) ... the increase in the hormone testosterone causes certain physiological changes in the adolescent male...
DEACON (V.O.): We're suffering. Suffering from a deep, debilitating addiction to something we've never even had. Teenage boys are like time bombs, ready to explode.
GUY 1: Did you hear about Rachael?
GUY 2: No, what happened?
GUY 1: John Baldwin nailed her.
DEACON: Are you talking about Rachael Unger?
GUY 1: Yeah. It was at Richard Rosenblatt's party. In the bathroom.
DEACON: (crushed) You're kidding.
DEACON: Rachael! What are you doing?
RACHAEL: We've been together for a year now, and I thought it was time to take our relationship to the next level.
DEACON: Now?
RACHAEL: You've been talking about this for months.
DEACON: I didn't think you were listening to me.
RACHAEL: Don't you want to?
DEACON: Of course I do. But, I, um... I don't have anything...
RACHAEL: I do.
RACHAEL (CONT'D): Deacon, what's the problem?
DEACON: I have a math test tomorrow.
DEACON (V.O.): "I have a math test tomorrow." The bottom line is, I just couldn't do it. I don't know why, I just couldn't. And I've cursed myself every day since then.
FRED: Did you videotape it?
MATT: (sarcastically) Yeah. I took my camera to gym class with me.
FRED: You are the biggest moron I have ever known.
DEACON: Hey, guys. Here's the money.
MATT: Something wrong?
DEACON: Yeah. I heard Rachael Unger did it with John Baldwin.
FRED: Well, you had your chance. I told you to seal that deal.
DEACON: Shut up, Fabio. I don't see you sealing any deals.
FRED: I'm biding my time.
DEACON: Whatever. It just wasn't good timing.
FRED: It doesn't get any better than that. You and Rachael were perfect for each other. And naked girls don't just appear out of thin air. (scoffs) "I have a math test tomorrow."
DEACON: Will you shut up already? (beat) Look, I've been thinking about this all day. We're juniors now. Upperclassmen.
MATT: So?
DEACON: So we have a responsibility to ourselves to start having fun and getting girls. This year is our year. (takes the chain off his bike) There's nothing holding us back any more.
DEACON (CONT'D): You see? That's exactly what I'm talking about. That could be us.
FRED: That's not going to be us this year, or next year, or any year, ever.
DEACON: Why not? All we have to do is follow the simple lessons of Tony Montana in "Scar Face."
MATT: Ooh. Good movie.
DEACON AND MATT: (with Cuban accents) "First you get the money, then you get the power, then you get the women."
FRED: So, we're going to become Cuban drug lords?
DEACON: Listen, the porno pirating operation is bringing in plenty of money. When I get my new car tonight for my birthday, we'll have the power to go wherever we want. Then, there's nothing stopping us from getting the girls.
JAKE: Bye, Sphincter!
FRED: Nothing's going to change, Deacon. You're still going to be the kid who shit his pants in fifth grade and no one will ever let you forget it.
DEACON: I had a stomach virus, asshole.
FRED: Oh, that's just not fair.
RUSS: Gotcha!
RUSS (CONT'D): I've been watching you.
RUSS (CONT'D): Those movies aren't for little monkey- boys!
FRED: Aaaaaahhhhhhhh!
RUSS: Come back here, you bastard!
RUSS (CONT'D): What else you got in here?
RUSS (CONT'D): (totally confused) What's this for?
DOLL: I'm Candy. Let's play dress-up.
MARK: Dude.
DEACON: And I signal exactly two hundred feet before the turn. Rule 108-1.
DMV TESTER: Great. Now after the right, I want you to parallel park in the open space.
DEACON: I begin the parallel parking maneuver by pulling within three feet of the forward vehicle. I now shift into reverse while turning the wheel two revolutions clockwise...
EVERYONE: Surprise!
DEACON: Wow. This is great.
MATT: Were you surprised?
DEACON: Yeah.
MATT: Really?
DEACON: Really. I was.
ROGER: Happy birthday, Deacon. It's Lois Lane #2. Be careful. It's still in the wrapper.
DEACON: Thanks.
MR. LEWIS: Are you ready for the big present?
DEACON: (laying it on thick) You mean there's more?
MR. LEWIS: It's in the garage. Come with us.
MR. LEWIS: It's a new computer system. You've been talking about it for months.
MRS. LEWIS: What? That's not what you wanted?
DEACON: No, it is. It's just--
MAX: I'll take it.
MRS. LEWIS: Max!
MR. LEWIS: We can exchange it if it's not the right one.
DEACON: No, I just thought-- I thought you guys were buying me that car I wanted.
MRS. LEWIS: A car? Why do you need a car?
MR. LEWIS: You can ask permission to use our car whenever you want, champ.
MR. LEWIS (CONT'D): I told you he didn't want a new computer.
MRS. LEWIS: Like you know what anyone in this house really wants.
DEACON: Now what are we going to do?
FRED: At least you got this great party.
MATT: Actually, we were expecting a lot more people.
MATT (CONT'D): What?
DEACON: You invited more people?
FRED: Well, we did send out flyers to like three hundred people from school.
DEACON: And no one showed up?
ROGER: I did.
DEACON: Great.
ROGER: Uh, guys. No one showed up because they're all at Tom Cooperman's house. He's having a keg party.
FRED: What? Why didn't I hear about this? That shit's not right.
ROGER: I heard it from Rahim. He beamed me the 411 in study hall.
DEACON: Let's go.
MATT: Why?
FRED: Yeah. Tom Cooperman kicked me in the balls in third grade, and I swear there is still a footprint on my nutsack.
DEACON: Come on, guys. Can I just get one thing that I ask for on my goddamn birthday?
MATT: He's got a point.
FRED: Fine. Watch your balls.
COOP: (ad lib) Grommets!
DEACON: Hey, Coop. Can we come in?
COOP: Sorry, son, that dog won't hunt. Y'all ain't on the list.
DEACON: Coop. It's my birthday today, so cut me some slack, all right?
COOP: (ad lib) Well, pickle my turnips, why didn't you say so? Happy birthday, friend.
ROGER: Little help?
DEACON: (in a trance) Oh, my God. There's Naomi.
FRED: She looks good.
FRED: She spilled her beer.
DEACON: Yeah.
DEACON (CONT'D): I'm gonna go talk to her. What have I got to lose?
FRED: Your dignity?
DEACON: She's Rachael's friend. It's not like I don't know her.
MATT: Ask her if she has any unusual hats. Girls like that.
NAOMI: Happy Birthday, Deacon.
DEACON: (pleasantly surprised) You remembered.
NAOMI: Well, I got this flyer and--
DEACON: Oh, right. So where's Jake?
NAOMI: Like I care.
DEACON: (hopeful) So you two aren't going out any more?
NAOMI: Duh.
JAKE (O.S.): Freakin!
JAKE (CONT'D): Hey, did you hear about Rachael Unger?
JAKE (CONT'D): He shoots, he misses, right, ass- sphincter? Come on, Naomi. We're going in the pool.
NAOMI: Screw off. I'm talking to Deacon.
JAKE: Whatever.
NAOMI: Whatever.
NAOMI (CONT'D): What an asshole.
J.T.: Deacon. I heard it was your birthday. Come on in the pool, man.
DEACON: No, that's okay.
MARK: No, seriously. It's cool.
KELLY: (come hither) Come on, Deacon.
WENDY: Yeah. Come on.
DEACON: All right.
MARK: Dude, what are you doing? Take off your clothes.
DEACON: What?
WENDY: We're skinny dipping, Deacon.
DEACON: Oh. Okay. Sorry, I'll just leave you guys alone then--
KELLY: --No, come on in. Join us.
DEACON: Wow. This feels amazing.
JAKE (O.S.): Coop's doing funnels. Come on.
J.T.: (rubbing it in) Sorry, dude.
DEACON: Hey, give me back my clothes!
JAKE: Freakin? I can't see you. Maybe I need to turn on the LIGHTS.
JAKE (CONT'D): Did you really think Naomi was into you?
JAKE (CONT'D): Oh my God! Skid marks. Aaaahhh, Deacon shit his pants again!
DEACON: No, I didn't! Give them back!
JAKE: Sphincter boy shit his pants!
DEACON: Hey, watch the nads!
COOP'S DAD: What the hell kind of sick shit is this?
DEACON: You know how long it's going to take to save up for a car selling porno tapes twenty bucks a pop?
DEACON (CONT'D): What?
FRED: There's a small problem.
MATT: What?
FRED: I got fired yesterday. Russ caught me and went berserk. Some sort of sting operation he's been planning for months. I don't know.
DEACON: You're kidding me, right? Tell me you're kidding.
FRED: No. And now I have to work twice a week at my dad's office. I told you this Scarface plan was stupid.
DEACON: Great. So now we've got no girls, no car, and no money.
FRED: And no porn.
MATT: Tony Montana would be very disappointed.
BIOLOGY TEACHER: Now turn your textbooks to chapter six, the Animal Kingdom. As you should know by now, biology is the study of life, in all its infinite varieties.
BIOLOGY TEACHER (CONT'D): So to keep things a little fun around here, tomorrow we're taking a field trip to the zoo.
DORKY FRESHMAN: Is this some kind of extortion racket? I'll pay you double if you can get me something today.
DEACON: I'm sorry. There's nothing we can do for a while. We don't have anything new.
DORKY FRESHMAN: I'm dying. I just need something.
DEACON: Hey, Naomi. What are you up to?
NAOMI: Going home to cram for midterms.
DEACON: Oh. I could help you. I mean, if you needed any help.
NAOMI: That's okay. I'll be all right.
NAOMI (CONT'D): So where did Rachael go off to?
DEACON: She went to Paris with the French Club. (then, taking a chance) We're seeing other people.
JAKE (O.S.): Hey, sphincter.
DEACON: Look, can you please stop calling me that? I think we're old enough to just let it go. All right?
JAKE: Oh, sure. Sorry about that... Shit-pants.
JAKE (CONT'D): Hi, Naomi.
NAOMI: Whatever.
JAKE: Oops. Sorry.
DEACON: (emphatic) Look, mom. I need a car.
MRS. LEWIS: But I thought we agreed--
DEACON: I need a car of my own.
MRS. LEWIS: Well, honey. A car is a lot of responsibility.
DEACON: Jesus, Mom. I'm seventeen now. I think I can handle it.
MRS. LEWIS: Well, it's also a lot of money. I'll tell you what. Maybe you can get an after school job to earn money for a car. I'll talk to your father.
FRED: Goddamn it.
MATT: Your dad really knows his firewalls.
FRED: Hey, asshole. Don't just come barging in here. We could have been naked.
DEACON: (excited) Shut up. I figured out how to get back on the Tony Montana track.... So, I'm at the zoo today...
BIOLOGY TEACHER: People! People! Come quickly. Witness the miracle of nature at its most primal.
DEACON (V.O.): And these monkeys are doing it. I mean, they're going wild. And Miss Ariel is videotaping it.
BIOLOGY TEACHER: (getting hot and bothered) With one final thrust of his engorged penis, the male deposits his seed and moves on. (suddenly bitter) Probably to a younger, more desirable female. One who doesn't have any "issues." Whatever that means.
DEACON (V.O.): That's when it hit me.
ROGER: A little help!
DEACON (V.O.): Well, Roger actually...
DEACON: Let's make one.
MATT: One what?
DEACON: A movie.
MATT: Great! That's perfect! I've already got an idea for a kind of sci-fi horror thing. It's like "The Shining" meets "The Jetsons."
DEACON: No, you moron. A porno film.
FRED: Even better.
DEACON: And check this out. The best part of all, is I've got an angle.
FRED: What kind of angle?
DEACON: We can make pornos that cater to guys like us.
FRED: You mean virgins.
DEACON: Yes. Adult films made by virgins for virgins.
MATT: With good cinematography.
FRED: And cute, nice girls. The kind you'd want to take to dinner with your parents.
DEACON: Right. No shots of sweaty guys' faces.
FRED: And nothing up the butt.
FRED (CONT'D): What? I don't like it when they put stuff up their butt.
MATT: These have to be nicely edited. We should shoot on super 16 and transfer to video.
DEACON: No, Matt. We'll shoot it on your video camera. We're not getting any expensive equipment.
FRED: How are we going to get the women to star in the film?
MATT: And the guys.
DEACON: I don't know. We'll surf the net. We'll figure it out.
DEACON (CONT'D): What?
FRED: That was really funny.
DEACON: I'm serious about this.
MATT: We can't make a porno movie.
FRED: Do you have any idea how much trouble we'd get in?
DEACON: Do you have any idea how much money we'd make?
MATT: Like how much?
DEACON: Enough for a car. Enough for more camera shit. To take girls out. I don't know. For whatever we want.
FRED: What about the moral implications?
DEACON: It's a free market transaction between consenting adults. What's the problem?
FRED: We're not adults.
MATT: He's got a point, Deacon.
DEACON: Guys, tell me the truth. Haven't you ever wondered... haven't you ever imagined what it would be like to make one?
MATT: Not really.
FRED: Okay. Sure. I've thought about it. I've thought about shaving Principal Taggert's ass, too.
DEACON: Look. This is an opportunity we shouldn't let slip away. If we make this movie, it could be the best year of our lives. We'll go in boys and come out men. And at the end, we'll have the money, the power, and the women. But you losers would rather play it safe. Well, I'm not going to waste another minute. I'm making this porno movie with or without you. And when I show up at school in my new set of wheels, and you two limp dicks are begging me for my sloppy seconds, I'll just have to tell you, "Sorry, guys. That ship has sailed. You blew it."
MATT: (sincerely) That was a really good speech, Deacon.
DEACON: Thanks.
MATT: Did you work that out before?
DEACON: No, Matt.
FRED: Okay... So say we were to do this. What would we call our company?
MATT: I've got it. "After School Special."
MIKE: That was good. Some good action.
VIC: I've got a question for you Mike, and I want you to promise to be completely honest.
MIKE: Sure. Of course, Vic.
VIC: Do you think I'm too fat?
MIKE: Are you kidding? The camera loves you.
VIC: Seriously?
MIKE: Absolutely.
VIC: Thanks, man.
VIC (CONT'D): Darla, sweetheart. Ready for number eight?
DARLA: Sure, Vic, lemme freshen up first.
VIC: (to Mike) Is he in there?
VIC: So, you think you can just walk into my town and move in on my territory?
FRED: We've got to have two forms of i.d. to prove she's over eighteen.
DEACON: How much money do we need?
FRED: A first time porno actress makes only two fifty to five hundred bucks.
MATT: That's it? Does that include the sex?
DEACON: Yes, Matt.
MATT: So how do we get women for this movie?
FRED: We place an ad in the Cleveland X-Press for "body models." That's like some sort of code word in the industry.
MATT: Are we supposed to have sex with these women?
DEACON: No, Matt.
NURSE: Fred, your father wants you to take these urine samples down to the lab.
FRED: Okay. In a minute.
FRED (CONT'D): We also need an adult signature to set up the bank account and the web site.
MATT: Let's use Principal Taggert's name.
FRED: Oh yeah, good idea. That'll never come back to haunt us.
DEACON: Then whose name should we use?
GREITZER: I'm Ronald Greitzer here for my 4:00 appointment.
RECEPTIONIST: Okay, Mr. Greitzer. I'll let the doctor know you're here for your... (checks the book) rectal exam. Have a seat.
DEACON: No way.
FRED: Why not? It's perfect. My dad's got Mr. Greitzer's signature on file, his credit card number, and his social security number...
DEACON: And he'll never find out?
FRED: It's not like we're going to send him our annual report. It'll just be like an official name of record or something.
DEACON: Okay. Cool.
NURSE: And take these fecal and semen samples, too.
FRED: And we need porno names.
DEACON: What do you mean?
FRED: It's a basic rule of porno. All people affiliated with the production of an adult film have porno names so their friends don't recognize them.
MATT: Oh, you mean like "Johnny Hardmember"?
FRED: Exactly. That's a good one. I'll be Balls McLongcock.
MATT: Ooh, I like it.
DEACON: Guys. Those kind of names are just for the actors.
MATT: You're just jealous that you don't have a cool porno name like us.
DEACON: Okay, fine. Then I'm Sam ... (searching) Slam. Sam Slam. The Back Door Man.
MATT: That name sucks.
FRED: You don't get it, do you? A porno name needs to be a very subtle thing.
DEACON: Sorry, Balls. I guess I'm still new at this.
FRED: Matt, pick that up.
MR. LEWIS: And I'm telling the guy, he's got to use form ND-45 for a third-party beneficiary, but Johnson's gotta be the big man. "We've been using ND-90 for twenty-two years." But Johnson's an idiot. He doesn't know ND-90 doesn't even exist anymore.
MRS. LEWIS: Hello? (covers phone) Deacon, it's for you. It's a young lady named Palomina.
DEACON: Yeah. 345 Remson. That's right. Great. Wednesday, three to five. Looking forward to working with you, too.
DEACON (CONT'D): I'm tutoring someone ... in math. To earn money for a car.
DEACON: No, we don't pay bus fare.
FRED: Sure, you can bring your dog. (beat) Oh. No, that's okay. Better leave him home.
FRED: I can't believe this is working.
MATT: When you have sex with a strange man, do you imagine it's like your boyfriend or something?
DEACON (O.S.): (over a walkie talkie) We're ready. Over.
MATT: Roger. Over.
MATT (CONT'D): You can go in now.
DEACON: Take a seat please.
FRED: Hi, I'm Balls McLongcock and this is Sam Slam.
CRACK WHORE: Tequila. You boys seem kind of young.
DEACON: Don't worry. We're old enough.
FRED: Tequila. Nice name. So, have you done any films before?
CRACK WHORE: I been in some home movies. Stuff like that. Some pictures.
DEACON: Okay, then. I think we have what we need. We'll call you.
CRACK WHORE: So you don't want me to suck you two off?
DEACON: No, I don't think that will be necessary at this time.
FRED: Maybe later.
MATT: Maybe if we put another ad in and say we're only looking for good looking models.
FRED: There's got to be another way to recruit porno actresses.
DEACON: I say we make them from Hawaii.
MATT: Hawaii?
DEACON: It's perfect. Do you know what a Hawaii driver's license looks like?
MATT: No.
DEACON: Exactly.
FRED: But isn't it going to seem a little suspicious? Like why are we in Cleveland?
DEACON: Vacation. People from Cleveland vacation in Hawaii, where do you think people from Hawaii go?
MATT: Aloha.
DEACON: Hey, mom. Can I borrow the car?
MRS. LEWIS: I have to go to the video store later.
DEACON: But, mom. You said I could use the car, but it's never free.
MRS. LEWIS: All right, Deacon. I'll walk to the store.
MAX: Where are you guys going?
DEACON: Out.
MR. LEWIS: Why are you boys dressed like Don Ho?
FRED: This is the new style, Mr. Lewis.
MAX: Yeah, for ass-wranglers.
MRS. LEWIS: Max!
FRED: Are we really going to do this?
DEACON: Oh, yeah.
DEACON (CONT'D): (once again) Oh, yeah.
BOUNCER: I.d.'s.
BOUNCER (CONT'D): Richard Runningbear from Hawaii? What brings you guys to Cleveland?
DEACON: We're on business, he's on vacation.
BOUNCER: Well, "tiki-alohi-noa-lohi."
DEACON: Sorry?
BOUNCER: That's Hawaiian for "welcome."
FRED: Right. Of course. We just moved to Hawaii a few months ago. Haven't picked up the local lingo yet.
BOUNCER: Okay. Have a good time, guys.
BOUNCER (CONT'D): Oh, and guys. (beat) Nice lamination job.
FRED: Thanks!
DEACON: Look. We have to get into this strip bar.
MATT: The next two years of high school depend on it.
BOUNCER: How old are you guys?
DEACON: Twenty-seven.
FRED: Thirty-five.
MATT: Sixteen.
BOUNCER: Sorry, guys.
DEACON: We've got money.
COCKTAIL WAITRESS: What'll you boys have? Two drink minimum.
FRED: Huh? Oh. I'll have a scotch. Straight up. On the rocks.
MATT: I'll have a seven and seven.
DEACON: Uh, same.
DEACON (CONT'D): What's a seven and seven?
MATT: I don't know. But I heard that guy over there order one and I like the way it sounds. Numerical.
DEACON: To After School Special.
MATT AND FRED: To After School Special.
MATT: It tastes like poison.
AMERICAN FLAG STRIPPER: Are you boys interested in a dance?
FRED: Okay?
MATT: Cool.
AMERICAN FLAG STRIPPER: You want another dance?
FRED: Uh, not right now, thank you. I have to go to the bathroom.
AMERICAN FLAG STRIPPER: Well how about you buy me a drink?
FRED: Okay.
FRED (CONT'D): Uhhhhh.
AMERICAN FLAG STRIPPER: (to the waitress) Seven and seven.
MATT: You want mine?
AMERICAN FLAG STRIPPER: So what brings you boys to the Pretty Kitty?
MATT: We're from Hawaii.
DEACON: Actually, we're filmmakers. We're here looking for new talent.
AMERICAN FLAG STRIPPER: Really?
DEACON: Yeah, we're looking for some beautiful ladies looking to break into film. You interested?
AMERICAN FLAG STRIPPER: No.
AMERICAN FLAG STRIPPER (CONT'D): But I know someone who is.
ASHLEY: Hi, I'm Ashley. You guys are filmmakers?
MATT: Video actually. They won't let me shoot on film.
DEACON: Look. We're paying top dollar, hetero only, no anal, and we're distributing through our web site.
ASHLEY: Aren't you kind of young?
DEACON: Aren't you? You know we're going to need two forms of i.d. to prove you're over eighteen.
ASHLEY: I'm eighteen. Don't worry.
FRED: Then you're hired.
MATT: Shouldn't we audition her first?
ASHLEY: Don't worry. You guys relax and have a few drinks. By the time the night's over, you'll know I'm your girl.
VIC: Someone's been recruiting new talent.
MIKE: Jimmy Rimmer says they're from Hawaii.
VIC: Why the hell would someone from Hawaii come to Cleveland?
MIKE: Vacation? There's the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
VIC: That's true.
VIC (CONT'D): What is this? "F" with Vic month? If any more amateurs start moving in on my territory, I'm going to get really mad.
MIKE: Who you gonna shoot?
VIC: I don't know.
MIKE: Calm down, Vic. I don't need you all agitated. You still got five films to star in today.
VIC: You're right, Mikey.
MIKE: Don't worry. I'll find these guys and take care of it.
VIC: You hungry?
MIKE: Yeah, I could eat.
VIC: Grab some lunch?
MIKE: Yeah, okay.
DEACON: What are you guys doing?
FRED: We came up with a great idea. We're going to presell the videos by posting the scripts on the website.
DEACON: Will that work?
MATT: I don't know. But it's kind of fun. We just wrote this whole thing about the girls' locker room.
FRED: One thing, though. If our motto is "by virgins, for virgins," I was thinking we should put a picture of one of us on the web site to sort of sell the image.
MATT: You're not putting my picture up there.
DEACON: It doesn't really have to be one of us, though, does it?
MRS. LEWIS: Deacon, look who's here. Your friend, Jake.
JAKE: Hi, guys.
MRS. LEWIS: You kids have fun.
JAKE: What the hell's going on, Sphincter?
DEACON: What are you doing here?
JAKE: I saw the strippers. And some crack whore named Saffron came over my house the other day looking for you guys.
FRED: We don't know what you're talking about.
JAKE: What's this? "Oh, my God. There's a boy at the door looking at us naked in the shower."
JAKE (CONT'D): "The A/V Club Secretary lathers all of their glistening bodies. 'I'm so dirty,' she moans." What the hell kind of crap is this? Are you guys running a whorehouse or something?
DEACON: No.
FRED: Are you crazy?
MATT: They're not whores if we film them, you moron.
JAKE: You retards are making a porno movie?
DEACON: You can't prove anything.
JAKE: Who's the girl?
MATT: A stripper. Her name's Ashley.
JAKE: Who's the guy?
JAKE (CONT'D): Well, maybe I could do it.
DEACON: No, that's not a good idea.
JAKE: Why not?
FRED: It's a lot harder than it looks.
JAKE: You don't think I can do it? Trust me, I've nailed enough girls.
DEACON: Forget it.
JAKE: Look, you little butt munch. I want to do this, and if you don't let me, I'll go and tell your mommy what kind of sick shit you're doing.
MATT: So, um, I'll be directing.
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: Okay. So I want you to play this very understated. It's a very visceral scene, so it's important not to play it too over the top.
ASHLEY: Uh huh. (beat) Hey, did you guys shave or something?
DEACON: Okay. I think we're ready here.
MATT: Boom in position.
FRED: What?
MATT: Ashley, get into position.
FRED: Are we actually going to do this?
DEACON: I guess so.
MATT: So, um, we're starting with the masturbation and then Phillip, the yearbook editor, is going to surprise you.
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: And ... action.
ASHLEY: (wooden) These yearbook photos of the Debate Club are making me so hot. I can't help myself.
ASHLEY (O.S.): I hope no one catches me because I forgot to lock the door. Oh, yeah. Oh, God, yeah.
DEACON: Close up.
MATT: What?
DEACON: Close up.
MATT: Oh yeah. Right.
MATT: Okay, CUT!
ASHLEY: What? Did I so something wrong?
MATT: Uh, no. You were great. I think I've got what I need there. I want to set up for Jake.
FRED: I need a bathroom break.
DEACON: Not now, Fred. Jake.
MATT: Action.
JAKE: (wooden) Oh, my God. What are you doing?
ASHLEY: I couldn't help myself. Please don't tell the principal.
JAKE: Give me one good reason why I shouldn't.
MATT: Cut. Perfect. Okay, then. Let's get to the, uh, sexual material.
DEACON: Jake, you okay?
JAKE: Sure. No problem.
MATT: And ACTION!
MATT (CONT'D): Action, Jake.
JAKE: Okay.
DEACON: Come on, Jake. We're filming.
JAKE: All right. Hang on a second.
FRED: My arm's getting tired.
ASHLEY: So's his.
MATT: Action...
ASHLEY: That's it?
JAKE: Hey, it's not hard yet.
ASHLEY: I can see that.
DEACON: Um, okay. Ashley, maybe you can help him out.
ASHLEY: Aaaahhhh!
MATT: Wait! I'm not set up for that shot!
FRED: Can I put down the boom?
DEACON: Jake? What's happened?
JAKE: This has never happened before. She got me too excited.
ASHLEY: Me? How did you ... without even getting hard first?
JAKE: (copping an attitude) What do you want to hear? I've got a tiny pee-pee? I'm a premature e-jac-u-la-tor? Sometimes before I get a boner? Okay?
DEACON: Calm down, Jake. We can shoot this scene again. Just relax. We can splice it together.
MATT: We'd have to do it like twenty times to get enough footage.
JAKE: I'm out of here. And if you dickwads tell anybody about this, first I'll kill you, and then I'll bust you guys.
ASHLEY: Now what?
MATT: Deacon. You do it.
DEACON: No way.
MATT: Come on. This is your big chance.
DEACON: No. You do it.
MATT: Fred.
FRED: What?
MATT: Come on.
FRED: You.
MATT: I have to run the camera.
FRED: Oh, like you're the only one who can do that.
MATT: (false bravado) Fine. I'll do it. I'll do it for the sake of the film. Hold this.
DEACON: Matt. Stop it.
MATT: No, I'll do it.
FRED: (grabs him) Matt!
FRED (CONT'D): Look, guys. Maybe we should just pay Ashley and chalk this up to a failed experiment.
MATT: Fine with me.
DEACON: No. We can get someone else.
FRED: Who?
DEACON: (nonchalant) Good issue.
DEACON (CONT'D): You ever think about getting into film?
DEACON (CONT'D): Where are you going, man?
DEACON: Don't you want to get it on with a sexy lady?!?
MATT: And that guy had real screen presence, too.
COOP: Hey, dudes.
COOP (CONT'D): (awestruck) You guys are gonna be legends of the school.
FRED: Oh, I've got it. What if the Math Team Captain is in detention for something...
MATT: For fixing grades for a girl...
FRED: Yeah, and the cheerleader is in there and she's going to get grounded if she fails one more test...
CHEERLEADER (V.O.): Well, maybe I can pay you some other way...
INDIAN MOTHER (O.S.): Mujibur, dinner is ready!
INDIAN BOY: In a minute!
MATH TEAM CAPTAIN (V.O.): Now that really computes!
MATH TEAM CAPTAIN (V.O.): Are you ready for your oral exam?
CHEERLEADER (V.O.): Oh, God, yes! I never knew math could be so stimulating!
DEACON: Are you okay?
NAOMI: Yeah. Thanks. I'm so embarrassed.
DEACON: (genuine) Really? I didn't think you got embarrassed about anything.
DEACON (CONT'D): Well, I guess I should go.
NAOMI: Deacon, wait. Block me for a second while I change my shirt.
DEACON: What?
NAOMI: Facing the other way.
DEACON: Oh.
NAOMI: I haven't seen you around here in a while.
DEACON: Yeah, I'm working on this project at home.
NAOMI: Cool. You can turn around now.
NAOMI (CONT'D): Listen. Mark and J.T. are having a party tonight. You want to meet me there?
DEACON: Really?
NAOMI: Why not?
DEACON: Okay. Cool.
MATT: Deacon, come quick.
DEACON: Matt, what's wrong?
BIOLOGY TEACHER (O.S.): Like all mammals, the whale gives birth to live young. Can anyone name another characteristic of mammals? Vinnie?
FRED: Our site got linked by another bigger site. Someone must have seen our stories and liked them.
DEACON: And?
MATT: We got a few more pre-orders and a ton of hits.
DEACON: How many?
MATT: Guess.
DEACON: A thousand?
FRED: Twelve thousand.
DEACON: Holy shit!
FRED: We need to hurry up and make this movie.
MATT: We should go over the schedule for tomorrow. And make sure the script is ready.
DEACON: Uh, I can't tonight guys.
FRED: Why? Where are you going?
DEACON: It's this thing I have to go to.
MATT: Is it a travelling carnival?
DEACON: No. Look, it's this party Naomi invited me to.
MATT: Can we come?
DEACON: Uh... Okay. I guess that's cool.
DEACON (CONT'D): I want you guys to come. It's just, I don't know. I kind of had this vibe from Naomi.
MATT: (still doesn't get it) We can just meet you there.
DEACON: Yeah. Okay. That's cool. Look, it's at Mark and J.T. Slistak's house. I'll see you guys there. I've got to get back to class.
MATT: Later.
MATT (CONT'D): What are you wearing to the party?
FRED: We're not really going to the party, you moron.
MATT: Why not?
FRED: Because I said so.
MATT: But we told Deacon-- I mean, we can't just not show up. What if Deacon is looking for us--
FRED: All right. All right. Stop crying already. We'll make an appearance.
MATT: Cool.
NAOMI: You know, Rachael's coming back from Paris in a couple of weeks.
DEACON: So?
NAOMI: So, aren't you even a little interested in seeing her?
DEACON: No. There's someone else I'd rather see...
MATT: Hey, guys.
NAOMI: So what's this project you guys are working on?
FRED: We can't really talk about it.
JAKE (O.S.): Yeah. It's private.
JAKE (CONT'D): Why are you hanging around with this loser?
NAOMI: What's your problem, Jake?
JAKE: What's yours?
DEACON: What was that all about?
NAOMI: He really pisses me off. Jake is such an asshole.
DEACON: Tell me about it.
NAOMI: When we were going out, he was so mean to me all the time. I think he's compensating for his little dick that never even gets hard.
DEACON: Well at least you were smart enough to dump him. I mean, you deserve someone who will treat you ... I don't know. Really well.
NAOMI: You know what you are?
NAOMI (CONT'D): You're a nice guy.
NAOMI (CONT'D): Deacon?
DEACON: I've been wanting to do that for a long time.
NAOMI: So why didn't you?
DEACON: Hey, where's Coop?
FRED: He was supposed to be here a half hour ago.
MATT: Maybe he got sucked into a black hole.
DEACON: Good one, Spock. I can't understand why you're not more popular with the ladies.
MATT: Look, we're wasting time. Deacon, why don't you just go in there?
MATT (CONT'D): Come on...
DEACON: Okay. Okay. All right already.
MATT: And action!
ASHLEY (O.S.): Maybe I can pay for the pizza some other way...
DEACON: And maybe I could throw in the sausage for free.
MATT: Fred, you get in there, too.
FRED: Are you sure?
MATT: Yeah, it'll be a great shot.
FRED: Hey.
DEACON: S'up?
FRED: How's it going?
FRED (CONT'D): Hey, did you see that show on Sci Fi about sun spots?
DEACON: Yeah. They said there's going to be a massive eruption next year.
DEACON (CONT'D): What?
FRED: You said "massive eruption."
MATT: Hey, quit the chatter.
FRED: Sorry.
MATT: Hey, why don't you guys kiss?
DEACON: What?
MATT: You know. Make out with each other.
DEACON: What?
FRED: All right.
DEACON: Wait. Why do you want us to kiss?
MATT (O.S.): Because that's what guys do in gay porn.
DEACON: What?
MATT: More sausage please.
DEACON: Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!
DEACON: Where the hell is Coop? There's no way I'm making out with Fred.
COOP: What's going on?
ASHLEY: Deacon is talking about making out with Fred.
FRED: No way. I'm holding the mike and that's it.
COOP: I thought we were doing straight porn.
ASHLEY: If you guys want to do gay porn, you still have to pay me.
DEACON: Hang on. Relax. It was just this stupid dream I had.
MATT: You dreamed about making out with Fred?
DEACON: No. Well, yes. And we were both having sex with you. But it was just a dream so let's forget it.
DEACON (CONT'D): What's with the light?
MATT: It's a "special effect." If you want this film to look amateurish, you're going to have to get someone else to do it.
DEACON: Okay. Relax.
FRED: Come on. Let's do it already.
MATT: Action.
ASHLEY: This summer tent-pole event-movie is making me so scared.
COOP: Hide your head down here and I'll tell you when it's safe to come up.
FRED: (snide; whispers) How's Naomi?
DEACON: Fine.
COOP (O.S.): Not yet. This is the really scary part.
DEACON: (whispers) Hey. Can I ask you a question?
DEACON (CONT'D): Do you ever think maybe we've gotten ourselves in a little over our heads with all of this?
COOP (O.S.): Oh, baby. Not yet.
FRED: Fire!
COOP: Unplug the light!
MATT: Wait, it's hot!
FRED: Run!
MATT: Quick, get the fire extinguisher!
DEACON: Where is it?
MATT: Over there!
DEACON: It's not working!
MATT: Oh. Me and Fred used it when we wrote the foamy cat fight script last week.
MATT (O.S.): Hurry!
DEACON: Large load.
MATT (O.S.): Deacon! Hurry!
MRS. LEWIS (O.S.): What's going on here?
MAX: Nice rack.
DEACON: Mom! Dad! What are you doing home?
MRS. LEWIS: Max sprained his wrist at soccer practice. What is going on here?
MR. LEWIS: Well, I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation why there's a naked girl in our kitchen. Right, Deacon?
MRS. LEWIS: Well...
DEACON: I, uh...
ASHLEY: I'm Deacon's girlfriend. Ashley.
DEACON: Yes, my girlfriend.
MRS. LEWIS: And what were you doing with your clothes off in my kitchen?
ASHLEY: We were having a make out party.
MRS. LEWIS: Where are the other girls?
DEACON: Their dates stood them up?
COOP: Yeah. My date wasn't feeling well.
FRED: Mine has mono. From too much making out. With me.
MRS. LEWIS: What's that smell?
MATT: We had a small fire, Mrs. Lewis. I tipped over a candle. It was to set the right mood.
MR. LEWIS: A fire? Let me see the damage.
DEACON: Dad, don't. Let me take responsibility. We'll pay to have it fixed.
MR. LEWIS: Damn right you will.
MRS. LEWIS: Well, Ashley. I didn't know Deacon even had a girlfriend.
MR. LEWIS: Maybe you can join us for dinner tonight.
DEACON: I think Ashley's busy tonight--
ASHLEY: Okay.
MRS. LEWIS: Okay, then.
MR. LEWIS: So get this. Johnson comes up to me today and he's all like "where's the ND-90's?" I'm like, "Johnson, they discontinued the ND-90 like six weeks ago." I've been telling this guy...
ASHLEY: Johnson sounds like a moron.
MR. LEWIS: Exactly!
MRS. LEWIS: So, Ashley. If I could ask you a personal question, exactly how old are you?
ASHLEY: Nineteen. But I tell people eighteen.
DEACON: Isn't that funny?
DEACON (CONT'D): I'll get it.
DEACON: What are you doing here?
NAOMI: I thought I'd come by and surprise you. Maybe we could hang out in your bedroom.
DEACON: Now's not a good time.
NAOMI: What's wrong?
DEACON: Nothing. Let's talk later.
MRS. LEWIS (O.S.): Deacon, who is it?
NAOMI: Hi, Mrs. Lewis. I'm Naomi. I'm Deacon's girlfriend.
MRS. LEWIS: His girlfriend?
MAX: Deacon has two girlfriends?
DEACON: Shut up, Max!
NAOMI: What do you mean? What's going on?
MAX: Deacon's other girlfriend is having dinner with us.
DEACON: I can explain.
MAX: This is Deacon's other girlfriend, Ashley.
MR. LEWIS: His other girlfriend?
ASHLEY: Hi.
NAOMI: Oh, my God. How old are you, you slut?
ASHLEY: Eighteen.
NAOMI: I thought you were a nice guy.
MRS. LEWIS: You need to have a talk with him. He could be having S-E-X.
MR. LEWIS: I need to give him a goddamn medal. (she storms off) What?
ASHLEY: Let her go.
DEACON: Are you insane? I've been fantasizing about Naomi Feldman since the seventh grade.
ASHLEY: Fantasy and reality are two different things, Deacon. Don't fall in love with who you think she is. You have to be sure you love the real person.
DEACON: So what should I do?
ASHLEY: Go after her then. Or don't. Whatever.
NAOMI: She's a porno actress in your porno film. She had to pretend to be your girlfriend because she ran upstairs naked when the light caused a fire. And you've never had sex with her or even kissed her.
DEACON: Yeah, pretty much.
DEACON (CONT'D): So, I guess this means you're not my girlfriend anymore.
NAOMI: Not necessarily.
NAOMI (CONT'D): I want to come to the set tomorrow.
DEACON: No, I don't think that's a good idea.
NAOMI: Why not? I'm curious. I've never seen a porno movie actually being made.
DEACON: Matt and Fred will get really mad. We're not supposed to tell anyone.
NAOMI: Tell them I'm a ... creative consultant. For the female point of view.
DEACON: No offense, but the female point of view doesn't really matter in these films.
DEACON (CONT'D): Okay. Okay.
MIKE: This After School Special shit is amazing. They're getting a ton of hits off their stupid stories and they don't even have any product.
VIC: Are you sure those are the guys from the Pretty Kitty?
MIKE: It's the same guys. Bingo. I just found out where they live.
VIC: Give me that address. I'm gonna teach these assholes a little lesson about the adult film business.
MIKE: Vic!
MIKE (CONT'D): You going like that?
VIC: Oh, yeah. Thanks Mike.
VIC: Goddamn amateurs. Think they can screw with Vic Ramalot.
MIKE: Let's do this.
GREITZER: Yes. That's me.
VIC: Ronald J. Greitzer?
GREITZER: Yes. That's right.
VIC: Oh, I get it. Brilliant. You're not even a fuckin' kid.
GREITZER: What are you doing?
VIC: What am I doing? I'm retiring you from the porno business. Permanently. Understand?
GREITZER: Yes. Yes. Please don't hurt me.
VIC: No more sweet young pussy, no more hot school-girl fantasies, no more goddamn pornos "for virgins by virgins." You got me?
GREITZER'S WIFE: Please don't hurt my husband!
VIC: Uh...
GREITZER: I'm sorry! I'll never rent them again! It was only that one time my wife was at her sister's! Please! I promise you!
GREITZER'S WIFE: You rented a dirty movie? You told me it was Jakob the Liar!
GREITZER: What? I shouldn't be entitled to a little joy in life?
GREITZER'S WIFE: Now look at the trouble you've brought to this house.
GREITZER: And I'm supposed to know the Religious Right would come after me for renting an adult film?
NAOMI: Five hundred dollars a night?
ASHLEY: Yeah, but if you can break into films, like these ones, you can get featured dancing gigs and make ten times that much.
NAOMI: No way.
ASHLEY: Seriously. If these guys ever get their act together.
FRED: What is she doing here?
DEACON: Naomi is my girlfriend.
DEACON (CONT'D): And I wanted her to help out. Give the script a female point of view.
FRED: Jesus, Deacon. Didn't you see that Beatles documentary on the History Channel? You're pulling a Yoko Ono on us.
DEACON: What?
FRED: Fine. Whatever. Let's get started. I'm sure she'll be really helpful.
COOP: Oh, hey, Naomi.
NAOMI: Hey, Coop. Are you helping these guys, too?
COOP: (sheepishly) Sort of.
MATT: Okay, people. Places everybody. Let's try to do this with a little heart, okay? And action.
ASHLEY: This quadratic equation is so hard.
COOP: Well, maybe we should just stick to long division.
NAOMI: Wait a second. Cut. This is all wrong. She wouldn't be fantasizing about some geek.
MATT: He's not a geek. He's the Math Team Captain.
NAOMI: No, he should be really well-dressed, and maybe he's a foreign exchange student from Portugal.
MATT: Um, and the director is the only one who's allowed to say "cut."
FRED: Who cares, Naomi?
NAOMI: Deacon agrees with me, don't you?
COOP: Dudes, come on. My nuts are getting cold.
ASHLEY: I'm out of here.
NAOMI: Shut up, Coop. This is important.
COOP: (swings his arms out) And my nuts aren't?
DEACON: Are you okay?
COOP: I'm sorry, Ashley.
ASHLEY: Look. This is ridiculous. Who does dress rehearsals for a porno shoot?
MATT: Oh, sure. Why don't we throw out the script while we're at it and "improvise."
ASHLEY: Guys, I appreciate the money. It's nice to get paid for sitting around doing nothing, but this isn't helping my career. I've got no footage for my reel.
FRED: Where are you going?
ASHLEY: Sorry.
COOP: Ashley, wait. I'm sorry. Ashley!
COOP (CONT'D): (calling after her) I love you!
FRED: Now what are we going to do? Your "girlfriend" ruined everything.
DEACON: Coop's the one that smacked her.
NAOMI: Besides, if you losers knew anything about women, we wouldn't have this problem.
FRED: Who asked you?
NAOMI: I don't have to take this.
MRS. LEWIS (O.S.): Ashley?
ASHLEY: Mrs. Lewis!
MRS. LEWIS: What are you doing here?
ASHLEY: I, um, I'm... I'm going where you're going.
MRS. LEWIS: To yoga class?
ASHLEY: Yes. Exactly.
MRS. LEWIS: I haven't seen you in class before.
ASHLEY: It's my first time.
MRS. LEWIS: Well, that's great, Ashley. You're really going to love it.
MRS. LEWIS (CONT'D): It's really easy, but if you can't keep up, just follow my lead.
MRS. LEWIS: You're quite flexible, Ashley.
ASHLEY: Yeah, people tell me that all the time. You know, I could teach you some of those moves. Mr. Lewis would love it.
MRS. LEWIS: Oh. Okay. Maybe later. Listen, Ashley. I want to ask you something... personal. About you and Deacon.
ASHLEY: Uh huh.
MRS. LEWIS: You know Deacon is only seventeen.
ASHLEY: Uh huh.
MRS. LEWIS: Right. So I was just wondering. You know. If you and Deacon... Well, if Deacon and you were...
ASHLEY: Um, no.
MRS. LEWIS: Good. Good. That's very good.
ASHLEY: Listen, Mrs. Lewis. You don't have to worry about Deacon. He's a good kid. If you just let him make his own mistakes in life, he's going to turn out fine.
NAOMI: So, do you have anything?
DEACON: Like what?
NAOMI: You know. Protection.
DEACON: Oh. Oh yeah. Of course.
NAOMI: Don't you want to?
DEACON: Of course I do.
NAOMI: Then what's the problem?
DEACON: It's my first time.
NAOMI: That's okay. Just go slow.
FRED (V.O.): (in Deacon's head) Every two minutes, they change positions.
FRED (V.O.) (CONT'D): It's a basic rule of porno.
FRED (V.O.) (CONT'D): The door. Always a classic.
ASHLEY (V.O.): Fantasy and reality are two different things.
FRED (V.O.): It's a basic rule of porno.
ASHLEY (V.O.): Fantasy and reality are two different things...
DEACON: I don't know. It was weird. Is it supposed to be so weird?
ASHLEY: Of course it was weird. True love can only exist between two women.
ASHLEY (CONT'D): Just kidding. I don't know, Deacon. Do you like this girl?
DEACON: Of course I do.
ASHLEY: Your heart is telling you that you don't. And I think it's time you start listening to your heart.
ASHLEY (CONT'D): Look. I have to go on. Just do whatever you want. Or don't. Whatever.
VIC: Thanks, Dave.
DAVE: Vic.
VIDEO DUPE GUY: Hey, Dave, there's a guy on the phone who wants to set up a new account.
DAVE: What's it for?
VIDEO DUPE GUY: Some outfit called After School Special.
MIKE: What did you just say?
VIDEO DUPE GUY: Nothing. It's for another customer.
VIC: Did you say "After School Special"?
VIDEO DUPE GUY: Shit, man. You must be crazy. (calling after them) Better watch your back, homie! You might get smoked!
DEACON: What are we doing here?
NAOMI: What? I thought you might want some new clothes.
DEACON: I don't need any new clothes.
NAOMI: And guess what? I booked facials for us at the Serenity Spa.
DEACON: Naomi. Wait. Stop.
NAOMI: What's wrong?
DEACON: I have to meet up with Matt and Fred this afternoon. I already blew them off yesterday.
NAOMI: Deacon, you don't have to hang out with those guys any more. Besides, you really need a facial. And I mean, I thought we could spend the day together. You know, after last night.
DEACON: But what about Matt and Fred?
NAOMI: Well what about me?
DEACON: What's going on? Are we going to find another girl? (off their look) What?
FRED: Matt and I have been talking.
DEACON: Yeah. About what?
MATT: We want to make this movie.
DEACON: I know. I do, too.
FRED: No, Deacon. We want to make the movie we wrote. We want to make it without you.
DEACON: Okay. I know what this is about, guys. I'm sorry about Naomi.
FRED: That's not the problem, Deacon.
DEACON: Then what is it?
FRED: I thought this was about us having fun and doing something crazy together. But as soon as you got what you wanted, you blew us off.
DEACON: You don't understand.
FRED: Do you even like her?
DEACON: Fine. Go ahead without me.
FRED: Fine.
MRS. LEWIS: So, Deacon. How'd you think you did on your midterms?
DEACON: Fine.
MAX: I found a dead bird on the soccer field. Its head was missing.
MR. LEWIS: I have to go back to the office tonight. Johnson screwed the pooch again.
MRS. LEWIS: Whatever.
BOUNCER: Enjoy.
PLANTAIN: Ash, you ready? You're up now.
D.J. (O.S.): ... they work hard for their money, guys, so let's tip them good. All right. Now, on the main carousel, let's give it up for the naughty school girl. ASHLEY!
MR. LEWIS: Hello, naughty school girl whom I've never met before.
ASHLEY: You, too, are someone whose kitchen I've never been in.
MRS. LEWIS: You get everything done at work?
MR. LEWIS: Yeah. All set.
MRS. LEWIS: Oh, guess who I ran into? Deacon's girlfriend, Ashley.
MR. LEWIS: Where did you see Ashley?
MRS. LEWIS: Over on Industrial Way.
MR. LEWIS: You were on Industrial?
MRS. LEWIS: You know, she is so flexible. It's really amazing some of the positions that girl can twist herself into.
MR. LEWIS: What?!?
MRS. LEWIS: She even offered to teach me. So I could move like that.
MR. LEWIS: Yeah, that would be great! I mean, if you're into that.
MRS. LEWIS: Maybe. I like her. I know she's a little older, but I think she's good for Deacon.
MR. LEWIS: You do?
FRED: So, what did you want to talk to us about?
DEACON: I wanted to say I'm sorry.
FRED: For what?
DEACON: For blowing you guys off.
MATT: That's okay, Deacon.
DEACON: No, it's not. It's just sometimes I feel like the whole world is passing us by and we're just sitting still. I don't know. Anyway, I'm sorry.
FRED: You know, you can be a real dick sometimes.
DEACON: Naomi and I did it the other night.
MATT: No way!
FRED: You're kidding, right?
DEACON: No, it's true.
FRED: How was it?
DEACON: Good.   At first. But then I kept   thinking about   all the pornos. Trying to   hit the right   spots, positions. I don't   know. After   a while it kind of seemed   like work.
MATT: I find that extremely difficult to believe.
FRED: So what now? Do we make this thing?
DEACON: I don't know. Maybe we should just call it quits.
ASHLEY (O.S.): Hey, guys.
DEACON: What are you doing here?
ASHLEY: I need you.
FRED: What?
ASHLEY: I need you to make this movie. For my reel.
DEACON: Well, actually we were--
ASHLEY: Ooh, look. An eyelash.
ASHLEY (CONT'D): Make a wish.
HAIRDRESSER: So, I'm thinking about getting into films.
ROGER: Okay.
HAIRDRESSER: You have any tips on how to break in?
ROGER: Uh, no. Not really. Acting classes, I guess.
HAIRDRESSER: Really? I didn't think there was a lot of acting in those films.
ROGER: Well, I guess it kind of depends.
HAIRDRESSER: You think you could get me an audition?
ROGER: For what?
HAIRDRESSER: Come on. How long have I been cutting your hair?
ROGER: Since I was like eight.
HAIRDRESSER: (whispers) I know who you are. Don't worry. Your secret's safe. Come on. I just want to make one film to see what it's like.
ROGER: That's great. But how can I help you?
HAIRDRESSER: Oh, I get it. You help me, I have to help you. That's how it works. Okay.
HAIRDRESSER (CONT'D): Relax.
ROGER: What're you-- Oh, God!
COOP: No, no, it's a municipal bond fund.
ASHLEY: But what about the capital gains?
COOP: Sure there's short term capital gains, but the dividends are tax free.
PLANTAIN: State and federal?
ASHLEY: Hey, guys. I hope you don't mind, Plantain and Baxter want to be in the movie, too.
BOUNCER: Hey! Mr. Runningbear!
ASHLEY: Ira, I have something important to tell you.
COOP: What is it?
ASHLEY: This prom is making me so hot. I'm ready to lose my virginity to you tonight.
PLANTAIN: My dress is ruined!
BOUNCER: I'm so sorry, Miss Jorgensen. What are we going to do?
PLANTAIN (O.S.): I never knew chaperoning the prom could be so "hard."
ASHLEY: That was the best prom ever.
COOP: You can say that again.
RACHAEL (O.S.): Deacon!
DEACON: Rachael?
RACHAEL: Hi, how are you?
DEACON: Good. Good. How was France?
RACHAEL: It was so fun. We just got back yesterday. The school totally screwed up my class schedule.
DEACON: So, how's John Baldwin?
RACHAEL: Who told you about that?
DEACON: Everybody knows.
RACHAEL: Well everybody is a liar. I never did it with John Baldwin.
DEACON: You didn't?
RACHAEL: Jesus, Deacon. I don't even know him. It's not like it was with us.
FRED: So...?
DEACON: How does it look?
MATT: It looks great. It's the best porno film I've ever made.
FRED: So what's the problem?
DEACON: Are you done with it?
MATT: Well, I cut together some footage to give to Ashley for her reel, but I don't think I can finish this film.
FRED: Why not?
MATT: I can't even watch it. Every time I turn it on, I keep thinking about that tuna fish sandwich and Coop farting all day long.
DEACON: That was pretty gross.
MATT: That's just it. The movie looks great, but seeing everything else -- all the disgusting, nasty stuff -- that's what's taken all the fun out of it. And I just don't want to do it any more.
FRED: Great. I knew it. I knew you couldn't handle this.
DEACON: Take it easy, Fred.
FRED: No, I knew that when it came down to it, Matt would wuss out.
MATT: You know what? Fuck you, Fred. You're the wuss here. At least I don't have to whack off every time I see a girl in the hallway.
FRED: Shut up, Matt.
MATT: No, you shut up! For once in your life, be a man and admit this movie was a mistake.
FRED: Why don't you make me?
DEACON: No. Matt's right. This movie was a mistake.
FRED: What are you talking about? This whole thing was your idea.
DEACON: Come on, Fred. Didn't you think this movie was going to be ... I don't know, sexy?
FRED: How long have you guys known about the bathroom thing?
MATT: If you didn't like making the movie, why didn't you say something?
FRED: I don't know. I thought you guys were having fun. I didn't want to be the wuss.
FRED (CONT'D): So what about the car?
DEACON: The Aerostar's not so bad.
FRED: What about the money and the power and the women? What about Tony Montana?
MATT: Scar Face is just a stupid movie, Fred.
MATT (CONT'D): So what do we do with this?
ASHLEY: Hey, guys. Great party.
DEACON: Thanks.
ASHLEY: I've got some big news. I sent the reel to Vivid and they want to fly me and Coop to L.A. to talk about a contract.
MATT: Wow. That's great, Ashley.
DEACON: Congratulations.
BOUNCER (O.S.): Deacon! Vinnie says we need more ice!
DEACON: Hang on, guys. I'll be right back.
FRED: Hey, Ashley. Can I ask you a question?
ASHLEY: Sure.
FRED: Do you think me and Matt will ever get girlfriends?
ASHLEY: Are you kidding? Come on, guys. You have it made. You're smart, funny, fun to be with. In a couple of years, girls will be dying to meet men like you.
MATT: Really?
ASHLEY: Well, no. Popular, good looking guys always get the girls. (off their look) Hey, what was I supposed to say?
ROGER: Hey, guys. Great party.
J.T.: I can't believe these losers are having such a killer party.
COOP: Hey, you're not on the list, dude.
J.T.: What's with you, you pussy? Are you joining the retard team, too?
PLANTAIN: Coop!
COOP: Plantain.
PLANTAIN: Come on. You don't need to wait in this line. Deacon and the guys are already inside.
WENDY: I can't believe Naomi dumped Jake for Deacon Lewis.
ASHLEY: Let me tell you something about Deacon. That boy is amazing in bed.
KELLY: And you are...?
ASHLEY: Ashley. Deacon's ex.
WENDY: Seriously?
ASHLEY: Seriously. Have your boyfriends ever given you an orgasm?
WENDY: No.
KELLY: I think so. (off Ashley's look) No.
ASHLEY: Have you ever felt so completely satisfied in bed that you just wanted to sleep for a week?
KELLY AND WENDY: No.
ASHLEY: You're wasting your time giving those Neanderthals blowjobs. I mean, they'll probably wind up unemployed wife beaters anyway.
KELLY: So, are Deacon's friends seeing anybody?
ASHLEY: Matt and Fred? I don't think so. But if you're interested, you better move fast. Those guys know how to do this thing ...
ASHLEY: How's Naomi?
DEACON: I don't know. Good, I guess.
ASHLEY: I thought she was your fantasy girl.
DEACON: Yeah. She was.
ASHLEY: You're gonna dump her.
DEACON: I don't want to. I don't know. It's not like it was when I was with Rachael. Rachael and I used to talk about stuff. We just, I don't know, connected.
ASHLEY: Very good, Deacon.
DEACON: What do you mean?
ASHLEY: Oh, nothing. I guess I'm just glad that you finally figured it out.
DEACON: Yeah, I guess I did. (beat) So I have to do this, don't I?
ASHLEY: (joking this time) I guess. Or not. Whatever.
DEACON: There's something I want to talk to you about.
NAOMI: What?
DEACON: I've been thinking. Maybe we should see other people.
NAOMI: What?
DEACON: Well, I mean, we don't really have anything in common. And we don't really even get along.
NAOMI: You're breaking up with me? (beat) Can we still have sex?
DEACON: Listen to what I'm saying, Naomi.
NAOMI: The only reason I went out with you was because I thought you were a nice guy. And now you're breaking up with me?
DEACON: Yeah. I guess so.
NAOMI: If you tell anybody about this... I have a reputation.
DEACON: I won't. You can tell people you dumped me if you want.
NAOMI: Really?
DEACON: Sure. What do I care?
NAOMI: You see? You are a nice guy.
DEACON: Just don't tell anyone about the movies. All right?
JAKE (O.S.): These guys are pornographers!
JAKE (CONT'D): They're perverts! They make porno movies in their basement!
DEACON: No one's listening to you, Jake. Give it a rest.
JAKE: Oh, really, skidmarks? I know someone who will believe me. Your parents.
DEACON: The web site is in someone else's name. All our records are encrypted. There's no tracing it to us, jerk off.
JAKE: Oh, really? Well, good thing I took the tape of Ashley masturbating in your basement. When they see that, they'll see what kind of movies their perfect little Deacon is making.
DEACON: Did you make a copy of it?
JAKE: No.
DEACON: You sent the original tape to my parents?
JAKE: Yup.
NAOMI: You know, Jake, you're a real dick!
DEACON: Jesus.
MATT: You should probably avoid pissing her off.
DEACON: Noted. Guys. We've got a problem.
VIC (O.S.): Not so fast, ladies.
VIC (CONT'D): Which one of you is Balls McLongcock?
VIC (CONT'D): Good name.
FRED: Thanks.
VIC: Too bad you're not going to be able to use it any more.
DEACON: Who the hell are you?
VIC: The competition. And who the hell are you, coming into my town, paying girls double what I'm paying them? This stupid After School Special shit is cutting into my business. So now I'm putting you out of business.
MATT: Please don't kill us, Mr. Porno Man.
VIC: Relax. We're not going to kill you.
MIKE: (matter of fact) We're going to cut your balls off.
FRED: What?!?
VIC: (re: Fred) Start with him.
FRED: Why me? It was all Deacon's idea!
DEACON: Okay. Do the leader kid.
MIKE: Quit squirming. It hurts a lot more if you struggle.
DEACON: Wait! Wait! Wait!
VIC: Come on, kid. Take it like a man.
MATT: We've got pre-orders!
VIC: What did you say?
MATT: We pre-sold copies of our video.
VIC: (condescending) How many? Fifty? A hundred?
MATT: No. Sixty-three thousand, two hundred twelve.
VIC: What?
MIKE: That's a lot of product, Vic.
FRED: We've got orders from all over the world.
DEACON: We'll give you the website if you let us go.
VIC: Okay, so what's your cut?
DEACON: Nothing.
FRED: Except...
DEACON: What except? There's no except!
FRED: Except you promise to supply us with quality porn free of charge. (off Deacon's look)
FRED   (CONT'D): It could come in handy. I mean, until we get girlfriends.
MATT: And...
DEACON: No, Matt!
MATT: (emboldened) And you have to maintain the artistic vision of After School Special.
VIC: And what's that?
MATT: The key is to try and remember what it was like before you had sex. What did you used to fantasize about? A math teacher who bends over a little too far. The door to the girls' locker room open just a sliver. Going over to visit your friend and catching his mother coming out of the shower.
FRED: Dude?
MATT: Not you. Deacon's mom.
FRED: Oh yeah. I've been there.
FRED: Deacon? Are you in here?
VIC: Okay. We've got a deal, but you gotta give me all your master tapes. (to Matt) And kid. If you ever need a job, give me a call.
MATT: It's been a pleasure doing business with you, Mr. ...
VIC: Ramalot. Vic Ramalot.
FRED: Good name.
VIC: Thanks.
MRS. LEWIS: Not yet. I'll go get it.
DEACON: It's a minivan! It can't go that fast!
MR. LEWIS: Looking for something in the mail, Deacon?
DEACON: No, I just--
MR. LEWIS: Maybe something you'd rather not have us see.
DEACON: Mom, Dad...
MRS. LEWIS: It's too late, Deacon.
DEACON: Wait--
MRS. LEWIS: We just want you to know how deeply disappointed we are in you.
DEACON: I can explain.
MR. LEWIS: Explain? Explain?
DEACON: If you'll just give me a chance...
MR. LEWIS: How are you going to explain this?
MRS. LEWIS: How did you manage to get a "C" in biology?
MRS. LEWIS (CONT'D): I knew we shouldn't have let him have a girlfriend--
MR. LEWIS: Let alone two--
DEACON: Is that what this is about? My biology class? It's just a stupid midterm grade.
MR. LEWIS: I don't like your tone, mister.
DEACON: Mom, Dad. I'm seventeen now. I'm driving. I've got a girlfriend. Well, actually, we broke up. But you guys treat me like a kid. Is it too much to ask for to be a normal teenager with a normal life?
MRS. LEWIS: You broke up with Ashley?
DEACON: No. Naomi. Look. I just want to have fun with my friends, okay?
MR. LEWIS: Okay, then. Just make sure you don't repeat this performance on your finals.
DEACON: I won't.
DEACON (CONT'D): How much do you know?
MAX: Pretty much everything. Mr. Slam.
MAX (CONT'D): These are my demands.
DEACON: Done. (beat) Did you know all along?
MAX: Are you kidding? Who do you think made the first pre-order?
DEACON: My advice is to go slow. If you feel you're losing control, just try to relax. Don't worry. It's easier than it looks.
MR. LEWIS: What do you think?
DEACON: This is for me?
MR. LEWIS: Are you crazy? It's for me. You want a new car, you get an after school job.
MRS. LEWIS: But we are letting you have the Aerostar. It may not be "cool," but it'll get you where you're going.
DEACON: Thanks, guys. Really.
MRS. LEWIS: We're going away for the weekend. Your father surprised me!
MATT: It's not even in focus. This is really shoddy work.
MATT (CONT'D): So, guys. I decided I'm going to apply to NYU next year. The film school.
FRED: Too bad we burned the film. You could have submitted it as your sample.
MATT: Good idea, Balls.
FRED: So, I guess we all got what we deserved. No money, no power, no women.
MATT: Tony Montana would be pissed.
DEACON: Speak for yourself, guys.
RACHAEL: Hey, guys. Deacon.
WENDY: Hey, guys. Hey, Deacon. I heard Naomi broke up with you.
DEACON: Yeah. But I think it worked out better this way.
WENDY: Hey, Fred. I hear you know a thing or two about giving women pleasure.
FRED: No, I don't.
FRED (CONT'D): Matt knows a thing or two about pleasuring women. I know everything.
WENDY: We should go out some time.
KELLY: Maybe all four of us could go out.
MATT: That could work, you know, depending on my schedule.
WENDY: Cool. So call me.
JAKE: Watch where you're going, sphincter boy.
DEACON: I thought I told you not to call me that anymore.
JAKE: What are you going to do about it?
DEACON: Some people never learn.
JAKE: I've got a tiny pee-pee? I'm a premature e-jac-u-la-tor?
JAKE: Stop it! Stop the video!
MATT: You probably shouldn't have mailed that tape back to us.
JAKE (O.S.): Tiny pee-pee. Tiny pee-pee. E-jac-u-la- tor. E-jac, e-jac, e-jac-u-laaaaaaa-tor.
DEACON: You know, guys, I've been thinking about something.
FRED: What's that?
DEACON: About how making the movie didn't turn out to be so fun. I think I figured out why.
DEACON (CONT'D): Sex is like a comic book, still in the original wrapper. Once you open it up and read it, it loses its value.
FRED: Deep.
MATT: I think he's got something there. Making that movie felt like we were tampering with forces we couldn't possibly understand.
DEACON: Exactly. The fun part about high school is unravelling the mystery of what's going to happen next.
MR. LEWIS: Why do they always have to show the guy's face?
MRS. LEWIS: To make you think you can get girls as hot as her. It's a basic rule of porno.
MR. LEWIS: Hey. Isn't that our basement?
