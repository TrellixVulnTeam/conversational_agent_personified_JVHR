THE ADDAMS FAMILY: by
SHOOTING SCRIPT: April 11, 1991
GOMEZ: Think of it, Thing. He's been gone for twenty-five years. For twenty- five years we've attempted to contact Fester in the great beyond...
GOMEZ: ... And for twenty-five years, nothing. Not a whisper, not a clue. I'm beginning to think my my brother truly is lost.
GOMEZ: (gazing at Morticia) Look at her -- I would die for her. I would kill for her. Either way -- what bliss.
GOMEZ: (adoringly) Unhappy, darling?
MORTICIA: (passionately) Oh, yes, yes. Completely.
WEDNESDAY: Thank you, Grandmama.
GRANNY: You kids are going to have to kill your own breakfast this morning.
MORTICIA: Gomez... the sun... il me perce comme un poignard.
GOMEZ: (wildly aroused) Tish... that's French!
MORTICIA: (nonchalant) Oui.
GOMEZ: Cara mia!
GOMEZ: En garde monsieur sole!
MORTICIA: Gomez?
GOMEZ: Querida?
MORTICIA: Last night, you were... unhinged. You were like some desperate, howling demon. You frightened me. Do it again.
GRANNY: Lousy bucket of bolts...!
GOMEZ: (disturbed) Granny - where's your fog?
WEDNESDAY: (taking her bag) Thank you, Lurch.
JUDGE WOMACK: Damn you, Addams!
GOMEZ: (calls) Sorry about the window, Judge! Keep the ball! I have a whole bucketful.
MORTICIA: The little ones, off to school. Bless them.
GOMEZ: They grow up so fast, don't they?
MORTICIA: Too fast.
GOMEZ: It's a milestone, Tish. This very evening -- our twenty-fifth seance. All those years, gnawed by guilt, undone by woe, burning with uncertainty...
MORTICIA: (yearningly) Oh Gomez, don't torture yourself. That's my job.
GOMEZ: (lustfully) Tish...
MORTICIA: Imagine, Darling, if Fester did come back. Half-alive, barely human, a rotting shell...
GOMEZ: Don't tease.
TULLY: Let me go!
TULLY: (to Gate) Gimme that! Stop it! I'm warning you! It's not a good day!
MORTICIA: (looking out) Tully is here, darling.
FESTER: (coming to his senses) Mother, I'm... I'm so terribly sorry... (he kneels at her side) It was just a party. It's over. It means nothing. Those Siamese twins, that hunchback, Cousin It - they're not you.
ABIGAIL: (clutching him savagely) Say it, Gordon. Make me believe it.
FESTER: I love you.   And I want money.
ABIGAIL: (very no-nonsense) We've got to find Tully.
MORTICIA: (whispering) Look - our little boy.
GOMEZ: (whispering) All tuckered out.
MORTICIA: (whispering) So sweet. He looks just... like a little entree.
PUGSLEY: (sleepy) Where... where's the party?
MORTICIA: It's over, darling - have you seen your sister?
PUGSLEY: Not since before the Mamushka.
MORTICIA: Gomez?
GOMEZ: Don't fret - we'll find her.
GOMEZ: Fan out. Pugsley - head for the dung heap. Mama and Morticia - the shallow graves. I'll take the abyss, and Lurch - check the bottomless pit.
MORTICIA: (worried) Her favorite...
GOMEZ: (calls out) Fester!!
FESTER (O.S.): Up here.
GOMEZ: Fester! You take the ravine!     And the unmarked, abandoned well!
FESTER: Somebody should stay behind - in case she comes back.
GOMEZ: Good man!   Good thinking!
GRANNY: Then who'll take the swamp?
GOMEZ: That's the spirit, Thing - lend a hand! Let's go!
ABIGAIL: Where the hell is Tully?
ABIGAIL: What are you doing?
TULLY: Relaxing.   Taking a little sun.
ABIGAIL: Have you gone mad?
TULLY: Au contraire.
GRANNY: (calling out) Wednesday! Wednesday!
MORTICIA: Oh, Mama, I was sure we'd find her here.
GOMEZ: What's all this?
TULLY: This is a restraining order, Gomez.
GOMEZ: A restraining order?
TULLY: It requires you to keep a distance of one thousand yards from this house. You've got about nine hundred and ninety-nine yards to go - catch my drift?
GOMEZ: (in disbelief) I am restrained - from my own house!?
TULLY: Not your house, moustache! Not any more! It belongs to the eldest living descendant, the older of the brothers -- Fester Addams!
GOMEZ: But - this is lunacy!
MORTICIA: Fester adores Gomez!
TULLY: He's afraid of him. Seeing the twins brought it all back. (to Gomez) You're bitter rivals, Gomez - always were, always will be!
GOMEZ: It's not so! Those girls meant nothing - he knows that! I demand to see Fester!
TULLY: Sorry - no can do. He's very hurt - it's not a good time. Leave it alone. Or better yet - just leave.
WEDNESDAY: But he isn't even Uncle Fester.
GOMEZ: (to his family) Do not fear - justic shall prevail. The courts will decide! (fervently) They say a man who represents himself has a fool for a client. Well, with God as my witness - I am that fool!
JUDGE WOMACK: Given applicable standards of proof, the attempts to impugn this man's character or question his identity have been woefully inadequate. It is with no small amount of personal satisfaction that I declare Fester Addams legal executor of the Addams estate and rightful owner of all properties and possessions contained herein. Gomez Addams... (He holds up a golf ball) I believe this is yours.
GRANNY: I like it.
MORTICIA: Just as long as we're together, n'est pas, mon cher?
GOMEZ: Huh?
PUGSLEY: This place isn't so bad. They even put candy in the bathroom.
MORTICIA: That's the soap, dear.
PUGSLEY: Oh.
WEDNESDAY: Do you want a cigar, Father?
GOMEZ: (in a monotone) They're very bad for you.
WEDNESDAY: (very worried) Father?
GOMEZ: But maybe I'll have one of those...
ABIGAIL: (to Fester) You're doing this on purpose.
MORTICIA: We are Addamses, and we will not submit. Who recalls the fable of the tortoise and the hare? The swift, yet lazy little cottontail, and his slow but determined companion? What does that story teach us, as Addamses?
GRANNY: Kill the hare. Skin it.   Boil it.
WEDNESDAY: Put the tortoise on the highway.
PUGSLEY: During rush hour.
MORTICIA: Yes! We will survive! Poison us, strangle us, break our bones - we will come back for more. And why?
GRANNY: Because we like it!
PUGSLEY: Because we're Addamses!
GOMEZ: (out of it) We're Addamses...
PUGSLEY: Here, Lurch.   On the house.
PERSONNEL OFFICER: We have so many homemakers re-entering the work force - your domestic skills can be very valuable. College?
MORTICIA: Private tutors.
PERSONNEL OFFICER: Major?
MORTICIA: Spells and Hexes.
PERSONNEL OFFICER: (knowingly) Liberal Arts. Have you been a volunteer, PTA, service organizations?
MORTICIA: Well, one day each week I visit Death Row at our local prison, with my children.
PERSONNEL OFFICER: (perplexed) With your children?
MORTICIA: Autographs.
PERSONNEL OFFICER: Well, what about your husband? Is he currently employed?
MORTICIA: He's... he's going through a bad patch at the moment. But it's not his fault.
PERSONNEL OFFICER: (with some bitterness) Of course not. What is he - A loafer? A hopeless layabout? A shiftless dreamer?
MORTICIA: (wistfully) Not anymore.
ABIGAIL: The Mediterranean, the Riviera - once we find the money, we'll go everywhere. We'll try again, right after lunch. Gordon - where should we go first?
FESTER: (sadly) I don't know...
ABIGAIL: Acapulco? Cancun? (she snaps her fingers in the air, castanet- style, trying to be festive) Ariba! Ariba!
FESTER: You choose.
GIRL SCOUT: (with grave doubts) Is this made from real lemons?
WEDNESDAY: Yes.
GIRL SCOUT: I only like all-natural foods and beverages. Organically grown, with no preservatives. Are you sure they're real lemons?
PUGSLEY: Yes.
GIRL SCOUT: Well... I   tell you what. I'll buy a cup, if   you buy a box of my delicious   girl scout cookies. Do we have a   deal?
WEDNESDAY: Are they made from real girl scouts?
MORTICIA: ... and so the witch lured Hansel and Gretel into the candy house, by promising them more sweets. And she told them to look in the oven, and she was about to push them in, when, low and behold, Hansel pushed the poor, defenseless witch into the oven instead. Where she was burned alive, writhing in agony. Now, boys and girls, what do you think that feels like?
GRANNY: Here kitty, kitty, kitty...
ALEX TREBEK: (reading from the card) Monsters Of History for $200. "He was known as the Butcher of Bavaria."
GOMEZ: (shouts) Grandfather Addams! (smacks his forehead, hard) Damn! Not in the form of a question!
GERALDO: Voodoo zombies - the stuff of legend, or a living nightmare? Do zombies really exist? How are they made? Where can we find them? Call in with your comments.
ABIGAIL: After lunch, we'll try again.
FESTER: (very flat) Yes, Mother.
ABIGAIL: We'll find the money. And meanwhile, we have this little nest. Quiet and cozy. Without that dreadful family.
FESTER: Yes, Mother.
ABIGAIL: Just the two of us, away from the world. Our dream come true.
FESTER: Yes, Mother.
GERALDO: So your son was brainwashed by voodoo slave masters and forced to recruit others. Let's take a call.
GOMEZ: (on the studio PA system) Geraldo...
GERALDO: (cutting him off) Mr. Addams, please stop calling. We don't know where they meet.
GOMEZ: Re-run.
PUGSLEY: I don't understand. All he does is watch TV and eat.
MORTICIA: I know - Gomez, let's go for a drive. The whole family.
GOMEZ: (not even turning) A drive? And miss "Matlock"?
GRANNY: Dinner's going to be late.
GRANNY (O.S.): Here, boy.   Here, boy.
WEDNESDAY: If that man isn't Uncle Fester, then who is he, mother?
MORTICIA: I don't know, darling.   I wish I did.
WEDNESDAY: Why is that lady doing all this?
MORTICIA: It's hard to say. Sometimes people have had terrible childhoods. And sometimes they just haven't found their special place in life. And sometimes they're dogs from hell and must be destroyed.
ABIGAIL: I know why you've been so glum. It's because it's taking us a little longer than we'd hoped to find the gold. Isn't that right?
ABIGAIL: Of course it is. Well, don't you worry - we're right on the verge. Tomorrow, for certain, my darling. (she kisses him on the forehead, and stands. She goes to the door, and turns) You know, some people might think it's strange, for a mother and son to be so close. I think it's beautiful. Don't you, Gordon?
ABIGAIL: (very stern) What?
FESTER: (dutifully) Yes, mother. It's beautiful.
ABIGAIL: (instantly very sweet, dabbing her eye with a fingertip) Look - I'm weeping.
MORTICIA: Stop it, you two.
MORTICIA: I would like to speak with Fester.
TULLY: We've been expecting you...
MORTICIA: (to Abigail, graciously) You are a desperate woman, consumed by greed and infinite bitterness. (a beat) We could have been such friends.
ABIGAIL: I don't think so. The vault, Mrs. Addams - any thoughts?
MORTICIA: (sweetly, to Abigail) Despite everything, I don't hate you. I pity you. Persecution, fiendish torture, inhuman depravity - sometimes it's just not enough.
ABIGAIL: Gordon - let's get started.
FESTER: But, Mother...
ABIGAIL: Stop stalling!
FESTER: I'm not stalling! Stop badgering me!
ABIGAIL: (pushing Fester aside) Tully, take over! Tighten it!
TULLY: I'd love to, you know that, but - I've got this stomach thing. When I torture people. It's just me.
ABIGAIL: (shoving Tully toward the rack) Do it!
TULLY: (to Morticia, politely) Where's your bathroom?
ABIGAIL: Again!
ABIGAIL: Tighter!
MORTICIA: (to Tully, flirtatiously) You've done this before.
GOMEZ (O.S.): Who is it?     We're paid through Thursday.
GOMEZ: (whispers) Slow down, Thing! It's terrible when you stutter!
GOMEZ: Morticia in danger... stop!    Send help at once ... stop!
FESTER: (to Abigail) You can't! Not with red-hot pokers!
TULLY: (queasy) Is this gonna smell?
MORTICIA: (graciously, with understanding) Tully Alford - charlatan. Deadbeat. Parasite. How Gomez adored you.
TULLY: Well, not enough.
FESTER: Morticia, please...
MORTICIA: Dear Fester - or whomever you are. Which is the real you - the loathsome, under-handed monster you've become? Or the loathsome, underhanded monster we came to love?
FESTER: (desperately) Don't ask me...
MORTICIA: Fester - I saw you tonight, at my window. I know it was you.
ABIGAIL: (furious) Gordon?
FESTER: (very upset) I was... restless! I couldn't sleep.
ABIGAIL: Gordon, I have a thought. Just a notion, top of my head. Tell me what you think. Since you and Mrs. Addams are so very close...
ABIGAIL: ... be my guest.
GOMEZ: Cara mia!
MORTICIA: Mon cher!
ABIGAIL: Addams!
MORTICIA: Darling, take care!
GOMEZ: Dirty pool, old man.      Never again!
TULLY: This is for keeps, Gomez!      Not just doubloons!
GOMEZ: One for you, Tully, and...
GOMEZ: ... one for me!
TULLY: Gomez... it's Tully. I'm your lawyer. I'm on retainer.
ABIGAIL (O.S.): Let him up!
ABIGAIL: (to Gomez) That's right! Now get moving - Addams, take him to the vault. And if you're not back in one hour... (the pistol aimed at Morticia, and using her accent) I displace her.
GOMEZ: Tish - seeing you like this.   My blood boils.
MORTICIA: As does mine.
GOMEZ: (touching the torture wheel) This wheel of pain...
MORTICIA: Our wheel.
GOMEZ: (to Morticia) To live without you - only that would be torture.
MORTICIA: (to Gomez) A day alone - only that would be death.
ABIGAIL: Knock it off!    The vault, Addams - right now!
FESTER: But, Mother can't we...
ABIGAIL: Can it, Gordon! Stop dragging your feet! You disgust me - you're nothing but a useless, snivelling baby! A stone around my neck! What was I thinking - I should've left you where I found you!
FESTER: No tricks, Gomez! That's the wrong book!
FESTER: Allow me...
GOMEZ: (murmuring) Good show, old man...
TULLY: Put that book down, Gordon! You don't know what it can do! It's not just literture!
FESTER: (advancing on Tully) Oh, really?
TULLY: I'm your friend, Gordon - think of the doubloons!
FESTER: They're not yours, Tully!     Back off!
MORTICIA: Quickly, my darling!
GOMEZ: Leather straps, red-hot pokers...
MORTICIA: Later, my dearest.
ABIGAIL: Keep the book closed, Gordon - listen to mother!
FESTER: I'll never listen to you - not ever again!
ABIGAIL: I had to be strict with you - because I cared! Put it down!
FESTER: You never really loved me!
GOMEZ: Come, my love - to safety!
MORTICIA: But what of Fester?
GOMEZ: (calling out, to Fester) Old man, this way!
ABIGAIL: Stop whining, you little good- for-nothing! Be a man!
FESTER: You're a terrible mother!   There, I said it!
GOMEZ: (calling out to Fester) Old man! This way!
CHILDREN: Trick or...
GRANNY: Well, it's their loss. I even made finger sandwiches.
FESTER: (petting Thing) Oh, calm down.
PUGSLEY (O.S.): Here we come!
GOMEZ: Pugsley, old man!
MORTICIA: (delighted) Look at you.
PUGSLEY: (to Uncle Fester) How do you like it?
FESTER: What can I say? He's going to break hearts.
GOMEZ: Let's get a picture!     Lurch?
MORTICIA: Oh yes - in the den.
MARGARET: Trick or treat!
COUSIN IT: Ooot oot glibber.
GOMEZ: Look, everyone! We have guests!
MORTICIA: Hello, Margaret. Cousin It - I almost didn't recognize you.
MARGARET: Isn't he handsome? Everyone keeps asking where he bought his costume.
GOMEZ: (admiringly) It is a wonderful hat.
MARGARET: (to Wednesday) And what are you, darling?   Where's your costume?
WEDNESDAY: (solemnly) This is my costume. I'm a homicidal maniac. They look just like everyone else.
FESTER: Halloween - it's such a special time. Ghosts and goblins. Witches on broomsticks.
WEDNESDAY: Children begging in the streets.
FESTER: I'm so glad I can share this night with my family - my real family. Now that I've got my memory back.
MORTICIA: That unfortunate woman. Filled with evil. (shaking her head, sadly) But not enough.
PUGSLEY: (to Fester) She wasn't your mother.     She just said that.
COUSIN IT: Ooot oot gleep.
GOMEZ: (to It) You remember, old sport - she really did find him tangled in a tuna net, twenty-five years ago. With amnesia.
WEDNESDAY: From the Bermuda Triangle.
COUSIN IT: Ooot oot oot.
MORTICIA: How true.   Stranger things have happened.
MARGARET: I'm sorry, and I'm not bitter, but I blame Tully.
COUSIN IT: Ooot blipper gleep.
MARGARET: (the coquette) Oh, stop. I'm blushing.
GRANNY: (to Fester) Thank God for that lightning. Knocked some sense into you.
PUGSLEY: Please, Uncle Fester?
GOMEZ: (jovially) Pugsley...
PUGSLEY: For the picture?
FESTER: You know, all the old sayings are true. There's no place like home. And blood is thicker than water.
MORTICIA: And just as refreshing.
GOMEZ: All right, everybody - time for a game! What shall it be - bobbing for apples?
MARGARET: Charades?
COUSIN IT: Ooot glibber glip.
MORTICIA: Of course - "Wake The Dead."
FESTER: (delighted, to Gomez remembering this childhood favorite) "Wake The Dead"!
GOMEZ: (equally excited) "Wake The Dead"! Out to the cemetery! Come on, everyone!
MARGARET: (to Granny) I've never played this before - how does it go?
GRANNY: Did you bring a shovel?
PUGSLEY: Uncle Fester, will you be on my team?
WEDNESDAY: No, mine!
FESTER: (to Wednesday) I tell you what - we'll give you a head start. Three skulls and a pelvis - how's that?
FESTER: My own dear brother - who could be more precious?
GOMEZ: Blood is thicker than water, old man.
MORTICIA: (touched by the brothers devotion) And just as refreshing.
GOMEZ: Let us never be parted.
FESTER: Let us always be as one.
FESTER: (joyfully, to Gomez and Morticia) Come on!
MORTICIA: We'll catch up.
MORTICIA: (deeply satisfied) Our family... what are they?
GOMEZ: Oh, Tish - what a night. Everyone -- together at last. What more could we ask?
MORTICIA: Gomez?
GOMEZ: (ecstatic) Cara mia... is it true?
MORTICIA: (shaking her head "yes") Oui, mon cher...
