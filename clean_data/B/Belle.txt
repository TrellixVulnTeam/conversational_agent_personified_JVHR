BELLE: Written by Misan Sagay
CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY: Hello little girl...Little Dido. (pause) I am your father.
CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D): (re. Dido) How lovely she is. So much of her mother. (his eyes sting) I tried...but how...how could I separate a mother from her child? (he restrains tears) And now nature has deprived me of such a dilemma.
CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D): Thank you..for taking her.
CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D): You may leave us.
CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D): Do not be afraid sweet thing. I am to take you to a good life. The life you were born to.
LADY MARY: Elizabeth Murray, bring yourself back here this very moment!
LORD MANSFIELD: What in God's name have you done!!
LADY MANSFIELD: She...she is black.
CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY: She is my blood.
LADY MARY: But she IS black!
LORD MANSFIELD: A detail you chose NOT to share.
CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY: Uncle? You assured me!
LORD MANSFIELD: (fury) Captain Sir John Lindsay, do you find me a fool? She is a MULATTO!
CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY: I have no wife to take her...In a few hours I am to captain a voyage to the Indies on a longitude experiment. (strained) From there, who knows!!! It is not in my gift to question the King and his Royal Navy.
LORD MANSFIELD: You keep in mind my position..? My reputation...?
CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY: Sir...
LORD MANSFIELD: Then have some sense of propriety boy...and understand what you are asking.
SIR JOHN LINDSAY: Her mother is dead! My wishes may not be orthodox but they ARE necessary!
LORD MANSFIELD: How do we raise her...?
SIR JOHN LINDSAY: I beg you, uncle...love her - as I would, were I here. (sadly) And ensure that she is in receipt of all that is due to her as a child of mine.
LADY MANSFIELD: That is simply impossible.
SIR JOHN LINDSAY: What is right can never be impossible.
LADY MANSFIELD: What has she been named?
SIR JOHN LINDSAY: She is Belle...after her mother. Dido Elizabeth Belle...Lindsay.
LORD MANSFIELD: She takes your name?
SIR JOHN LINDSAY: I am not ashamed.
LADY MARY: We cannot have another Elizabeth in the household.
LADY MANSFIELD: We...we will call her Dido. (off Lindsay's nod) Good Lord, she is thin. Mary, find her something to eat.
SIR JOHN LINDSAY: Little Belle - sweet child... (weak smile) My wish is to keep you...keep you with me...but a ship...it is no place for one so precious as you. (pause) In these walls, yours will be a life equal to my blood.
SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D): You will not understand in this moment, but hold this in your heart...you are loved...Just as I loved your mother.
ELIZABETH: Are you...a nee-gro?
ELIZABETH (CONT'D): Are you what they call `a negro?' I heard them talking.
LADY MARY: Questions, questions, Elizabeth! Tis a most irritating trait you and your father share.
ELIZABETH: Papaa M?
LADY MARY: No your blood papaa. Sir David Murray. You should not insist on always speaking your mind, you know. You will end up an old maid with only your own company for entertainment!
ELIZABETH: Like you, Aunt Mary? That is what the maids say?
LADY MARY: You little....
LORD MANSFIELD: Captain Sir John Lindsay. (off her reaction) Do you recognise him?
LORD MANSFIELD: D'you see here...? This..this is your grandfather, Sir Alexander Lindsay of Evelick.
LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D): I am here too....do you see?
LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D): Yes...I am William Murray, First Earl of Mansfield.
LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D): (carefully) Now...do you see this man? He is my nephew...do you understand...? (off Dido's nod) ...your uncle - Sir David Murray.
DIDO: Elizabeth's papa.
LORD MANSFIELD: You are a sharp little one. He is The Seventh Viscount Stormont... (beat. Almost to himself) ...to inherit everything that we are standing on when I am gone.
LADY MANSFIELD: Born on English soil?
LORD MANSFIELD: Impossible. Any match her..'other origins' may attract would surely disgrace her and the family rank.
LADY MANSFIELD: And when we are no longer here? No husband - who will take care of her?
DIDO: Bette! No...no surprises Bette!
LADY MARY: (shrieking) Girls! Will you refrain from shrieking like the...bless-ed French!
REVEREND DAVINIER: ...for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth. So saith Christ the Lord. Amen.
CONGREGATION: Amen.
REVEREND DAVINIER: Hymn no. 76.
LORD MANSFIELD: I have reason to speak with you alone, Dido.
DIDO: Have I wronged you, Papaa?
LORD MANSFIELD: You have done no such thing.
LORD MANSFIELD: I have not past experience in the ways of breaking grave news to you.
DIDO: (quiet, shock) I thought I should one day have the opportunity to make his better acquaintance.
LORD MANSFIELD: Yes.   I know.
ELIZABETH: Two thousand pounds a year?
ELIZABETH (CONT'D): Then you are an heiress! He has left you your fortune!
ELIZABETH: He must have loved you, Dido.
DIDO: He did not know me.
ELIZABETH: My father's new wife wishes him to leave me not a thing, and he obliges her.
DIDO: Then it is her cruelty you should lament, Bette, not his stupidity.
ELIZABETH: I think he might have loved me more if Mamaa had not died.
DIDO: (pained) I...I think love must be a very complicated thing.
ELIZABETH: Dido - with such a dowry you may marry into any good family you wish.
LADY MARY: We shall receive visitors for dinner.
ELIZABETH: Visitors? Who ever bothers to visit us here?
DIDO: Or leave... except the dead!
LADY MARY: Once again, Dido?
DIDO: Beds...Aunt Mary. We should prepare some extra beds... in case our visitors are to stay...
ELIZABETH: May we wear the new silks?
DIDO: I will do your hair, Bette. Oh say we may wear them, Aunt Mary.
LADY MARY: You will not be dining with us, Dido.
DIDO: (hurt) Yes of course. But I may join after dinner, may I not?
LADY MARY: Yes. Such are the rules, and you know them well.
DIDO: She is a most disagreeable... hideous, old maid - I hate her!
LORD MANSFIELD: You do not! She is only managing the dictates of the household
DIDO: Papaa...how...how may I be too high in rank to dine with the servants and too low to dine with my family?
LORD MANSFIELD: Dinner with guests is a formal proceeding, Dido - we simply cannot impose the disregard of those formalities upon visitors.
DIDO: But...Papaa, am I not..'wealthy', now...an heiress? Surely that changes matters...
LORD MANSFIELD: (softly) My dear...I wish it were so simple. Finances may go some way - but Society has a habit of disregarding even one of their own, when opportunity provides.
DIDO: (stung) Of course...(trailing off)
LORD MANSFIELD: BUT after dinner...when formality is of less consequence...well your presence can raise no defendable objections. (off her sadness)
LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D): Dido, you know the rules of propriety. Far better than Elizabeth, if I am frank.
DIDO: As you wish, sir.
LADY MANSFIELD: Dido!...
ELIZABETH: There you are. I have been searching for you!
LADY MANSFIELD: (to Dido) What a wretched countenance!
LADY MARY: She deplores my authority. What am I in this household, if not the `observer of rules'?!
ELIZABETH: I would rather dine with Dido!
LADY MANSFIELD: What a great pity
LADY MARY: Indeed.
LADY MANSFIELD: Our young gentlemen guests shall miss you, Elizabeth.
ELIZABETH/DIDO: Young gentlemen?
LADY MARY: Very good connections.
LADY MANSFIELD: And most agreeable by all accounts!
LADY MARY: Close your mouth and understand: There shall be no discussions tonight in any languages other than English! No whisperings in gentlemen's ears - not in Latin, Italian...and certainly not French!
JAMES ASHFORD: What excellent French! Though I have not an idea of what you said.
ELIZABETH: I said...`Your hands have the suggestion of a sensitive man'.
LADY ASHFORD: I must say, the entire country barely breathes awaiting your judgement on this appeal. Terrified you shall destroy England, no doubt. I know Lord A is. He does wonder though, what can be taking you...so long?
LORD MANSFIELD: (mild condescension) The law, Lady Ashford. It is to be interpreted - not merely administered.
LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D): Your husband of all people knows this.
LADY MARY: My brother is not a man of rash instinct.
LADY MANSFIELD: For that we are all grateful.
LADY ASHFORD: What a lot of fuss over dead cargo.
LORD MANSFIELD: It is a fuss over the bread and butter of a great many in these isles. A great many, Lady Ashford.
DIDO: Wimbridge!
WIMBRIDGE: Miss Lindsay?
DIDO: There are poachers wandering...!
JOHN: Good evening to you. I am John Davinier, I..I believe I may have disturbed a lady of this house...
JOHN (CONT'D): Ah...she is there. (calling out to her) Please forgive me...though you barely gave me a chance...
DIDO: Sir, I do not believe we have been introduced!
JOHN: Indeed. I...I... (to Wimbridge, feeling foolish) Please inform the lady of my apologies for startling her. I took advantage of the back fields, by way of a short-cut to deliver this to Lord Mansfield... from my father.
WIMBRIDGE: Sir?
JOHN: Reverend Davinier.
WIMBRIDGE: Of course, sir. I will see that he gets it immediately...
DIDO: You shall not interrupt him at dinner, Wimbridge!
WIMBRIDGE: Immediately - after dinner, sir.
JOHN: Yes, of course...thank you.
JOHN (CONT'D): (to Wimbridge, awkward) Good night.
WIMBRIDGE: Good night, sir.
LORD MANSFIELD: Dido...my dear.
LADY ASHFORD: (whispers to her sons) Good Lord - the negro! She really is...
JAMES ASHFORD: (quietly disturbed) ...a lady.
OLIVER: Capital!
LADY ASHFORD: I hadn't expected her to look so...black.
OLIVER: Mamaa, did you not listen to the rumours when you were spreading them?
LORD MANSFIELD: May I present to you the second of my nieces - Miss Dido Lindsay.
OLIVER: A pleasure, Miss Lindsay.
ELIZABETH: (sotto - re. James) He is the eldest - to inherit the entire Ashford fortune. He is also to inherit from his uncle - a healthy man, who shows little sign of departure.
DIDO: How do you know?
ELIZABETH: Lady Ashford herself. She seems rather despondent at her brother's robust constitution.
DIDO: He has much to recommend him. And a second fortune in life should please any wife.
ELIZABETH: Dido! You are not to be a coquette with him! You already have your fortune!
DIDO: Are you suggesting I now condescend to a gentleman without means, Bette?! What should good society think of us!
OLIVER: She is intriguing, is she not?
JAMES: I find her repulsive.
OLIVER: I suppose she is...if you find a most rare and exotic flower so. She is quite something to behold.
ELIZABETH: (flustered, to DIDO) Good Lord! They are appraising me!
JAMES: One does not make a wife of the rare and exotic, Oliver. One samples it on the cotton fields of the Indies...
OLIVER: So far, when it is right at my door?
JAMES: ...Then finds a pure ENGLISH rose to decorate one's home.
LADY ASHFORD: Is she `OUT'??
LADY MANSFIELD: (embarrassed) Not quite.
LADY MARY: (awkward) Any day now.
LADY ASHFORD: You will refrain from any intercourse with the negress. (beat) Lord and Lady Mansfield may find it fascinating to have a Lady Mulatto running around their household, but I will not have one running around mine!
OLIVER: She is an heiress.
LADY ASHFORD: Although exceptions can be made.
OLIVER: It is said that her father left her a rather vast fortune.
LADY ASHFORD: I mean to say, if that is your inclination.
OLIVER: She is rather soft on the eye - I have thought no further Mamaa.
LADY ASHFORD: From where did you receive your information?
OLIVER: Her sister-cousin has a rather fast tongue.
OLIVER (CONT'D): And what of you Miss Lindsay? Are we to hear you play tonight?
DIDO: Well... (deferring to her father) Papaa...?
OLIVER: Oh do not be selfish with your good fortune, m'lord!
LADY ASHFORD: This will be most interesting!
LADY MARY: She has never played in company!
LADY ASHFORD: (conceding) She is...most accomplished.
LADY MANSFIELD: (with deep satisfaction) Hers was a most diligent governess.
LADY MANSFIELD: The liberty of asking her to play! And when he can have no better intentions towards her.
LADY MANSFIELD (CONT'D): Can he??
LADY MANSFIELD (CONT'D): ...His family name will, no doubt, entice her to take him seriously.
LORD MANSFIELD: She must not delude herself. Such decisions are not hers to make.
LADY MANSFIELD: Then spell it out to her! Before she renders herself...sport to some `gent' of cruel promises!!!
LORD MANSFIELD: She has no reason. Hers is an inheritance that renders her free of the usual inducements to marry.
LADY MANSFIELD: Well, that, at least, is true, (burdened, grave) Indeed, it is Elizabeth who needs to secure her bread and butter.
ELIZABETH: A portrait? Are you sure?
DIDO: Yes...Aunt Mary has confirmed it.
ELIZABETH: Good Lord. How...truly wonderful.
DIDO: But...but...
ELIZABETH: (becoming exasperated) But what, Dido?
DIDO: Papaa...should he not have wished to SEE me before deciding?
DIDO (CONT'D): (to Lord M) I am sorry...I did not know you...
LORD MANSFIELD: (dry) Mr Davinier, I believe you have already had the pleasure.
JOHN: (ironic) In...some way - yes. (to DIDO) Miss Lindsay.
LORD MANSFIELD: Decide what?
DIDO: If he should...should WANT to paint me!
LORD MANSFIELD: The man is to be paid a fortune. What is there to decide?
DIDO: But...
LORD MANSFIELD: Dido, you are to simply sit still. Not a challenging task!
DIDO: (anxious) Next...next to Elizabeth...?
LORD MANSFIELD: As you always are - right beside one another.
JOHN: Should...should not any lady be flattered to be such a subject?
DIDO: How should any male know the ways of a lady when he has not even mastered the ways of a gentleman?
JOHN: Quite! Though one should be forgiven for thinking he was in the presence of a lady - when she is, in fact, still a juvenile!
DIDO: Papaa, may we do this in private!
LORD MANSFIELD: Not now, no! You may return the books to the library.
DIDO: Papaa...!
LORD MANSFIELD: Upon her husband's death a widow may receive....
JOHN: ...her marriage portion and inheritance at once. She has forty days to leave her husband's home...
LORD MANSFIELD: Hummm... (contemplation) Yours are grand ambitions.
LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D): What is the purpose of the law in your eyes, Mr Davinier?
JOHN: To... to provide certainty where there might otherwise be none.
LORD MANSFIELD: Example.
JOHN: The Zong ship and those drowned.
LORD MANSFIELD: It is one of the few trades acceptable to a gentleman.
JOHN: I am no member of the nobility - I have little, but...where my father relies on the bible, I...I wish to rely on the law courts.
LORD MANSFIELD: You aspire to the judiciary?
JOHN: One day...yes...m'lord. I wish to make the laws not only administer them - for that...that is how I may truly change this world. I mean to say, make it... a better place.
LORD MANSFIELD: Noble if not pompous! A country lawyer, you may make - perhaps! If you pay every regard to what you are taught - but you have neither the rank nor finances for any more!
JOHN: (tentative) If I may, m'lord - neither did you!
LORD MANSFIELD: I beg your pardon?
JOHN: Well...as a fourth son, you had rank but not the income to pay for your qualification to the Inns.
JOHN (CONT'D): Without the sponsorship of Lord Foley and William Hamilton...the English courts may not have benefited from your brilliance - and the title, Lord Chief Justice could not be yours today...M'lord.
LORD MANSFIELD: You believe you are worthy of such considerations? Such are your capabilities?
JOHN: That I do not know, M'lord. I have not yet been afforded those considerations...but I know a country life does not suit me.
LORD MANSFIELD: The Reverend has requested I take his son into my tutorage, Dido. (Beat) What do you think?
JOHN: Thank you for your gracious support.
DIDO: I neither spoke for or against you - since neither is my place.
JOHN: Silence speaks volumes.
ELIZABETH: Papaa's new student.
JOHN: Indeed!
DIDO: Mr Davinier, my cousin, Elizabeth.
JOHN: A pleasure.
DIDO: (to John) Papaa has never taken a pupil, you realise?
ELIZABETH: Someone to keep you company while you take Papaa's dictation, Dido. (to John) Truth is, there have been more of your sex at Kenwood this week, than I've previously seen in all my entire life!
JOHN: Hopefully we have not disappointed!
ELIZABETH: On the contrary!
DIDO: Mr Davinier, what...what is the importance of the Zong... why is the case before Papaa's court, the supreme court...?
JOHN: Well... (he struggles, tentative) It is a cargo ship.
DIDO: I...I am aware of that.
JOHN: A human-cargo ship.
DIDO: Oh. You said those who were drowned.
JOHN: It lost most of its slaves before arriving at its destination. (hesitant) Drowned - by the crew on the captain's order.
DIDO: But...why?
MAID: Miss, your supper is served now in the ladies' parlour.
DIDO: Thank you.
LADY MANSFIELD: Mr Davinier, will you be joining us for dinner?
JOHN: I..er...I thank you, Madam, but I am promised to the company of my aunt this evening. She has recently moved to the cottage at Belsize.
LADY MANSFIELD: Of course - as you wish.
JOHN: Permit me to ask, why you do not dine with your family - ever?
DIDO: That is not correct.
JOHN: Forgive me...but twice now I have seen...I have seen you separated from the gathering.
JOHN (CONT'D): I am confounded.
DIDO: And well you might be - when the son of clergy is permitted to the table before a lady of the house.
JOHN: Is that a reminder of my place, Miss Lindsay?
DIDO: No. It's a statement of mine!
JOHN: (he pats his animal) There is much speculation on your decision. Anticipation seems to be turning to panic, m'lord.
LORD MANSFIELD: I cannot disagree.
JOHN: One hundred and thirty two drowned on route from Africa to the West Indies. Your ruling could bring the slave trade to its knees - entirely destroy an economic foundation of these lands. (off Mansfield) Is that pressure not maddening, m'lord?
LORD MANSFIELD: Justitia fiat, ruat coelum, Mr Davinier - Let justice be done, though the heavens may fall.
JOHN: The insurance claim states, the slaves were thrown overboard for the safety of the ship - that there wasn't sufficient water for the cargo and crew to survive the rest of the voyage.
LORD MANSFIELD: It does.
JOHN: Then, if I am correct, the case hangs on...
LORD MANSFIELD: ...IT HANGS on `Absolute necessity'. If the cargo was spoiled...
JOHN: Cargo?
LORD MANSFIELD: If the killing of the..'negros' was truly `necessary' in order to save the ship - as the captain contends.
JOHN: But...is that where it hinges?
LORD MANSFIELD: The ship's journey was thwarted by impossible weather conditions - what should have been weeks became months! What once appeared enough water, may not have been!
JOHN: I am sensible of this, m'lord...
LORD MANSFIELD: Then do you know what a hundred thirsty slaves are capable of? I can tell you no man happily disposes of his cargo, even in the face of rebellion! (Off John's silence) So now tell me - were you to dock at port with barely a piece of merchandise left to trade - what would you do?   Swallow financial ruin - or claim your due from the insurers.
JOHN: With due respect... I should question, whether 'human' life should have been insurable as cargo - at all.
LADY MARY: A gentleman rather like him once paid me much interest.
ELIZABETH: Mr Davinier?
LADY MANSFIELD: (matter of fact.) Really, Mary?
LADY MARY: Do not look at me like that! It was my Mamaa who intervened. I thought he had a very great sense of duty. Overly kind at times but...
DIDO: (gently) But...what, Aunt Mary?
LADY MANSFIELD: HE is engaged, you know?
LADY MARY: Engaged!
ELIZABETH: Is he?
LADY MANSFIELD: Mr Beresford's daughter.
ELIZABETH: The carriage-maker! He might have set his sights a little higher!
ZOFFANY: To the window, Miss Lindsay
DIDO: Wait...
JOHN: I...I was curious...
DIDO: Quite a task - to sit for so many hours...(beat)... Congratulations! I learned of your..your match..yesterday.
JOHN: Thank you.
DIDO: I appear the only one to have just learned of this affair?
JOHN: Perhaps yours is a life less concerned with such matters.
DIDO: Why do you judge me so?
DIDO (CONT'D): It is a fact that I have contemplated on the matter for many hours, and I...I do not think the slaves could have been drowned in the way you say.
JOHN: Are you at utter disconnect from everything?!
DIDO: Mr Davinier...please. Tell me. Tell me what you know!
DIDO (CONT'D): (earnest) Do not render me your amusement.
JOHN: I can only tell you what I believe.
DIDO: (trying to understand) And what...what is that?
JOHN: The slaves were intentionally drowned, that is not in question. Chained! Thrown into the waters - chained together as one.
JOHN (CONT'D): They were diseased - worth more as dead insured merchandise, than as alive spoiled goods. (stark) The captain hoped it would `pay' to kill them.
JOHN (CONT'D): Miss Lindsay....?
DIDO: But the insurers are appealing.
JOHN: Yes. They are challenging the decision of the lower court - refusing to pay for murdered slaves.
DIDO: Thank you.
DIDO: (whispers) Papaa.
ELIZABETH: There you are!
ELIZABETH (CONT'D): We are requested. You - drawing room. I, relegated to the ladies' Palour!
LADY MANSFIELD: We are to attend London for the Season.
DIDO: We are to finally `come out'??
LORD MANSFIELD: (clarifying) Elizabeth is to come out.
DIDO: But why?
LORD MANSFIELD: You understand the ways of this world for a female, Dido. Elizabeth has no income. When all this is gone to her father, I have nothing to leave her.
ELIZABETH: Oh!
DIDO: And me?
LORD MANSFIELD: Dido, you are well taken care of - Of this, you are well aware.
ELIZABETH: But she is not merely my cousin, Mamaa, she is my sister. I cannot attend London without her!
LORD MANSFIELD: You may attend London together to keep Elizabeth company and save the pain of a few weeks separation.
LADY MANSFIELD: Lord knows I will need you both to keep each other out of trouble.
DIDO: Papaa...
LORD MANSFIELD: You are not to be denied, Dido.
DIDO: Papaa, please!
LORD MANSFIELD: These are the keys to the house. They have hung at the waist of your aunt for the last thirty years.
DIDO: (horrified) No! I am not Lady Mary. I am not an unwanted maid!
LORD MANSFIELD: Lady Mary is too old to continue in charge of the house.
LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D): You may assume her duties on your return. A most respectable position for an unmarried Mansfield Lady.
DIDO: Are...are you punishing me?
LORD MANSFIELD: Punishing you!! Dido, you are most cherished. Most loved. Why ...why would you say such a thing?
DIDO: Because...
DIDO (CONT'D): Because ...
LORD MANSFIELD: Because what?
ELIZABETH: I am sorry, Dido. So very sorry.
LORD MANSFIELD: You told her they were wantonly drowned.
JOHN: Because they were! Those slaves were diseased - some were already dying - yes. But it was essential they die ON the journey or they would not come under insurance consideration! Neither too, if they had expired of their diseases - That is why they were killed - this we all know!
LORD MANSFIELD: You have entered my home and utterly taken advantage of the confidential matters afforded you.
JOHN: These `matters' have been for public consumption for months. Miss Lindsay is no child...no.. fool!
LORD MANSFIELD: (incandescent) Her precious care is in my hands and I will decide when she is ready for such realities. Not the son of a vicar! A vicar who, incidently purchased his living from me!
JOHN: I shall gather my belongings.
LORD MANSFIELD: Do so!
JOHN: Your Lordship, a question?
LORD MANSFIELD: WHAT, Mr Davinier!
JOHN: As the mere son of a vicar - I wonder whether the value you extend to your very precious mulatto niece - well I wonder if it amounts to MORE...or LESS than the thirty pounds insurance the traders are asking for each life they murdered?
JOHN (CONT'D): Good day, M'lord.
LORD MANSFIELD: Mr Davinier.
LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D): A word to the wise. Find yourself in her vicinity again, and you will rue the day you cast eyes on me.
ELIZABETH: John Davinier is leaving very early today!
ELIZABETH (OOV): Do you think I may see Mr James in town?
DIDO (O.C.): Perhaps.
ELIZABETH: I could fall in love with such a man, Dido.
LADY MARY: Love?
DIDO: (whispers) Bette, you could feel no such sentiment for you should either end poor or... broken hearted.
ELIZABETH (O.C): Aren't you quietly relieved?
DIDO: Relieved?
ELIZABETH: That you shan't be at the caprice of some silly Sir and his fortune! (off Dido's silence) The rest of us haven't the choice! Not a chance of inheritance if we have brothers and forbidden from any activity that allows us to support ourselves.
ELIZABETH (CONT'D): (c'est la vie) We are but their property.
LADY MANSFIELD: Light the fires for dinner, will you, Thomas.
DIDO: You are so beautiful, Bette. I hope your match is the most wonderful of all gentlemen.
MABEL: Some bed socks for you, Miss Murray, Miss Lindsay. It's not as warm as we hoped tonight
ELIZABETH,: Thank you Mabel...How kind.
MABEL: Can I help you with that, Miss Lindsay?
DIDO: Mabel, I am fine - thank you!
MABEL: You must start from the ends, miss.
MABEL (CONT'D): My Mam taught me, see?
LADY MANSFIELD: Promise me you will change that vulgar teal paint, if you ever become lady of this home. It is positively wanting, Elizabeth.
MAID: Lady Mansfield, LADY MARY and their nieces, Madam.
LADY ASHFORD: Ladies.
LADY MANSFIELD: Lady Ashford.
LADY MANSFIELD (CONT'D): And the gentlemen? Mr James?
LADY ASHFORD: (reassuring) Here, of course. Very little could have prevented him, knowing that Miss Murray would visit today.
LORD ASHFORD: Lord Mansfield's infamous Mulatto. No wonder our `Lord Chief Justice knows not whether he is coming or going! Not your usual game, Oliver.
LORD ASHFORD (CONT'D): She can not know your thoughts unless you offer them to her.
LORD ASHFORD (CONT'D): The ladies Mansfield! As sweet on the eye as the freshest flowers in bloom.... (off Lady M's laughter) What is in those glasses?
LADY ASHFORD: Grenadine syrup...
LADY MARY: And port!!
LADY MANSFIELD: Which has gone to my head already!
ELIZABETH: Oh Dido look - Mr James has made me a boat and it has capsized.
DIDO: What a dreadful shame.
OLIVER: (to DIDO, earnest) For you.
DIDO: Thank you.
OLIVER: Miss Lindsay, would you do me the honour of taking some air with me, some time?
JAMES: Don't you care what people will say
ELIZABETH: What is that to mean Mr James? What should anyone say?!
JAMES: That he should compromise a lady's reputation by stepping out with her - scarcely having made her acquaintance!
OLIVER: I think you are a great deal too anxious, brother. We should merely take a turn around Vauxhall.
DIDO: I should be delighted, Mr Oliver! Most delighted.
ELIZABETH: Are you really to defy Papaa?
LADY MANSFIELD: (re. Dido with Oliver) I am not at ease with this. Lord Mansfield would be most aggrieved.
LADY ASHFORD: Oh it can do no harm. This is simply two families, enjoying a day together.
LADY ASHFORD (CONT'D): Though surely...IF a desirable match were a ... certain... possibility your dear husband could have no objections, could he?
OLIVER: Well I did not think I would ever find a lady who was not to be conquered or ignored...Until you.
DIDO: Ah now how do I know this is not just another tactic in your battle to conquer?
OLIVER: See how my heart beats.
OLIVER (CONT'D): I am utterly taken with you, Miss Lindsay.
DIDO: Despite...such pronounced protestations from your brother?
OLIVER: He cannot overlook your mother's origins, as I do. Foolish. Why should anyone even pay her regard when your better half has equipped you so well with loveliness and privilege.
DIDO: What a lovely sound.
OLIVER: You are unrelentingly cultured. Come, let's find it!
LADY MANSFIELD: People will think she has no family!
LADY ASHFORD.: People will think they are courting!
LADY MARY: Let her enjoy his society.
OLIVER: I might only have dreamed of these moments, at one time.
DIDO: Really? You are much of the conqueror Mr Oliver.
JOHN: Miss Lindsay.
DIDO: (flushed) Mr Davinier. How...how nice to see you.
JOHN: And you, Miss Lindsay.
DIDO: Forgive me - Mr Ashford, may I present to you...Mr Davinier. (She smiles awkward)
DIDO (CONT'D): He is the son of our Vicar at Hampstead, and was..well, almost father's pupil...
OLIVER: A clergyman! (an `off' smile) Good day, to you...sir.
JOHN: Sir. (beat) My regards to your family, Miss Lindsay.
DIDO: Elizabeth and Mamaa are here... in fact.
JOHN: (dismayed) Miss Lindsay, you are alone!!
DIDO: I did not have the chance to see you before you left...Mr Davinier ...to convey my apologies.
JOHN: Apologies...?
DIDO: Your pupilage. Father would never have ended it...you...you never would have had to leave Kenwood were it not...
JOHN: He would make mine a living hell, were he to know of us speaking.
JOHN (CONT'D): Forgive me.
DIDO: What are you doing here in London Mr Davinier?
JOHN: I am under a third cousin - a solicitor, here. Nothing more than petty disputes between unsavoury landlords and debauched tenants, but I cannot discount it.
DIDO: Not what you wished for.
JOHN: I haven't given up on The Inns. Nothing worth having in life comes easily.
DIDO: (flushed) Where are my manners? I trust the future Mrs Davinier is well.
JOHN: Very well...thank you.
DIDO: I have tried to keep up - with the Zong. These past weeks.
JOHN: (agitated) Tis pitiful! Such inability to simply know what value to put on another's life.
DIDO: (bitterly) What price, a worthless Negro.
JOHN: (frustrated) You utterly misunderstand me. I am saying that no man may have the value of that of cargo!!! Human beings cannot be priced, since we are priceless!! Freemen and slaves alike!
JOHN (CONT'D): (enthused) I am with others here. We are all students in law - applying pressure on the insurance companies to refuse from here on to insure slaves on any ship. A simple clause.
DIDO: But that would require a change of law. I know nothing but...
JOHN: A change in law - something the insurance companies can lobby for IF they can be persuaded to band together. (softly,) We may only be students, but...change is most always precipitated by the young. (shrugs - poignant) Someone has to have the courage. How can we expect to be civilised if we live in a barbaric world.
JOHN (CONT'D): It is the utter injustice...the industrial slaughter of so many.
DIDO: No. It is more than that. It's the shame of a law that would uphold a financial transaction upon that atrocity.
JOHN: That is indeed the truth.
DIDO: I have never heard anyone speak like you.
JOHN: Nor I, you, Miss Lindsay.
JOHN (CONT'D): You must return. They will be anxious. Should I follow to see you safely.
DIDO: No we cannot risk it.
JOHN: Good bye, Miss Lindsay. (he pauses) I suspect, we will never see each other again.
DIDO: Good bye, Mr Davinier.
JOHN: Miss Lindsay?!! (tentative) We...commune at the Coaching Inn - Kentish Town...most evenings..
DIDO: Quite.
OLIVER: I did not dare return to Lady Mansfield without you.
DIDO: (relieved) I..I am terribly sorry. I thought I saw the others, I went after them....and found myself lost.
LADY MANSFIELD: It's almost dark!
LADY ASHFORD: Look, here are James and Miss Murray.
ELIZABETH: I do hope you know how well I think of you.
JAMES: As I do you.
ELIZABETH: Then I hope, Sir, you plan to honour your attentions...as not to would leave me looking... quite foolish.
JAMES: And I should not call myself a gentleman!
LADY ASHFORD: Say nothing! This has all been for the good of the future, I assure you!
LADY ASHFORD (CONT'D): Elizabeth is a determined spirit.
LADY MANSFIELD: She is.
LADY ASHFORD: She will need a gentleman who can temper her. Quite a task.
LADY MANSFIELD: (to Lady Ashford) Do I sense that an address is finally to be made?
LADY ASHFORD: She is an exquisite girl... (with relish) And...since there is no male heir and...it will therefore fall upon Elizabeth and her husband to eventually inherit all of Kenwood and its lands...
LADY MANSFIELD: Lady Ashford, may I...
LADY ASHFORD: ...I realise there will be no end of worthy addresses to consider.
LADY ASHFORD (CONT'D): My dear? Lady Mansfield, what is it?
LADY ASHFORD: (disgusted) Without an inch of property, or shilling to her name!
LADY ASHFORD (CONT'D): Your situation can attract so much better, James. She brings nothing but name. A real lady is blessed with SO much more.
OLIVER: (sardonic) Do you hear that, James? A lady's good breeding alone will not do!
LADY ASHFORD: (to Oliver) Your brother needs a wife who will bring him further land! LOTS!... if he is ever to exert more political influence than your father has.
JAMES: But what of her own father?
LADY ASHFORD: The Seventh Viscount Stormont is a scoundrel. Ensconced in Vienna with the girl's vicious step-mamaa and his new offspring - who I am told is to inherit EVERYTHING.
LADY ASHFORD (CONT'D): I must say, pen-ni-less! Thankfully her cousin is not. It is true that on each occasion I lay eyes upon that girl, she becomes more beautiful.
JAMES: She has the colouring of a farmer.
LADY ASHFORD: James, we do not talk about that, any longer.
JAMES: Is this really the very best you aspire to, Oliver? To introduce some woman of obscure birth into the family lineage?
LADY ASHFORD: James - you are my first boy - blessed by law to inherit your father's wealth. Be sympathetic to your brother. Like the unfortunate Miss Murray - a good family name and empty pockets will only get him so far!!
LADY MANSFIELD: Good heavens, Lord Mansfield has arrived a day early!
LADY MARY: (calls out) Mabel! Freshen the flowers!
DIDO: (facetious) Is Mabel a slave?
LORD MANSFIELD: I beg your pardon?
DIDO: Is-Mabel-a-slave!
LORD MANSFIELD: She is free and under our protection.
DIDO: (twice as facetious) O! Like me!
ELIZABETH: Hardly, Dido!
LORD MANSFIELD: And paid a very respectable wage.
DIDO: How is the fraud appeal Papaa?
LORD MANSFIELD: Fraud?
DIDO: The marine insurance. It is a Fraud case, is it not?
LORD MANSFIELD: That would depend on to whom you may speak.
DIDO: To cull your `cargo'? To do it solely to claim insurance because it was too diseased to achieve a good price at market? If not fraud, then what?
LORD MANSFIELD: Do you speak on my behalf, Dido?
LADY MANSFIELD: Oh will you please stop!
LADY MANSFIELD (CONT'D): This is a vulgar subject to be discussing at breakfast
LADY MARY: I learned yesterday that Mr Davinier is in town.
LORD MANSFIELD: Makes sense. Dido is beginning to sound very much like him.
DIDO: Excuse me.
LORD ASHFORD: I had the pleasure of laying eyes on your adopted girl.
LORD MANSFIELD: (facetious) Which one?
LORD ASHFORD: You have raised a lovely young lady...And, though I understand she is kept under interesting rules, She raises questions.
LORD MANSFIELD: Spit it out.
LORD ASHFORD: Her introduction to society comes at a key time in the insurance appeal. Parliament is nervous that your `family situation' will colour your judgement.
LORD MANSFIELD: I will neither be pressured from the inside - or the outside.
LORD ASHFORD: (calm) You are the highest judge in the land.
LORD ASHFORD (CONT'D): In you, they see a man who is of the persuasion and position to bring down the major trade of our time and the commercial health of this country. Some will say, next to our king, you are the most powerful man in England. And the same will ask how you, our Chief Justice can be fair?
LORD MANSFIELD: How? RULES are in place to dictate how we live - were that not the case, I would not have had the mandate to give shelter to my nephew's child.
LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D): She is his blood - MINE! And rightfully had entitlement to grow up on the family estate. (aggrieved) The parliamentarians may challenge me - let them! I can tell you all, if the law supports the Zong's slave owners as strongly as Murray blood runs through Dido Belle's veins - make no mistake - the insurers will be forced to pay up!
LORD ASHFORD: (softly) I believe you.
LORD ASHFORD (CONT'D): I have reason to speak with you on another matter.
LORD MANSFIELD: Oh?
LORD ASHFORD: (tentative) I have a wish to seal the bond between the Ashford and Mansfield names. It would, however, require some relaxing of your most stringent rules, I must add!
LORD MANSFIELD: Is that so?
LORD MANSFIELD: I have had reason to speak with Lord Ashford.
LADY MANSFIELD: And I to Lady Ashford. (beat) Are we in agreement?
LORD MANSFIELD: We are. (long beat) You once asked me, who would look after her when we are gone. Money is no substitute for a man's protection. I cannot deny her a match so suitable.
ELIZABETH: Whatever did happen in the end, Aunt Mary? With your gentleman friend.
LADY MARY: He never married. Cousin Marjorie wrote me last year, that he had died after a long illness.
ELIZABETH: Oh Aunt Mary...
MABEL: Pardon me. Mr Ashford is here for you, miss.
DIDO/ELIZABETH: Which Mr Ashford?
MABEL: O excuse me! Mr Oliver, for you, Miss Lindsay.
LADY MANSFIELD: You need worry about nothing. Your Papaa has been dealt with.
OLIVER: Hello, Miss Lindsay.
DIDO: Mr Oliver.
OLIVER: I do hope my reason for being here will bring you as much happiness as it brings me.
OLIVER (CONT'D): I think...well, I know...that we make a rather good match. (he pauses) Father has purchased me a commission in the navy - as colonel - Is that not the rank your blood father first purchased?
DIDO: (anxious) Yes. Indeed it is.
OLIVER: So I feel my career is now set. All that remains...
OLIVER (CONT'D): I can not offer you a title, Miss Lindsay..for the next `Lady Ashford'...well that title must fall to my brother's wife... (huge,nervous breath) What I am trying to say is, I can without doubt, offer you ALL that is due to `Mrs Oliver Ashford' and...and I trust that this would be acceptable to you. (he hesitates) Since...it would very much be my privilege...my honour, if you would agree to become my wife.
LADY MARY: I cannot see...!
LADY MANSFIELD: Shooosh!
ELIZABETH: What are you doing?
LADY MANSFIELD: Quiet, Elizabeth!
DIDO: Good Lord, Mr Oliver! Your ...your wife? Mrs Ashford?!
DIDO (CONT'D): (swallows hard.) ...I cannot... (she pauses) I cannot...think of anything ...more wonderful!
LADY MANSFIELD: (overjoyed) She has agreed! O...
ELIZABETH: Agreed?
DIDO: Mamaa, we are engaged!
DIDO (CONT'D): It is a good thing, is it not, Mamaa?
LADY MANSFIELD: (whispers, poignant) You are my heart - from the moment I saw you. I only want you to be happy.
ELIZABETH: Dido...was there any message for me?
DIDO: No, Bette (beat) But..I am sure it won't be long.
ELIZABETH: What does it feel like Dido? To be engaged?
DIDO: (unsure) Perfect, Bette - pefect.
DIDO: Papaa.
DIDO (CONT'D): Thank you.
LADY MANSFIELD: We are to make many calls today, Elizabeth. Acquainting oneself with the most eligible gentleman is not light business.
ELIZABETH: Should we not wait a day or two - for Mr James?
LADY MARY: Elizabeth - some advice.     Wait for no man, dear!
LADY MANSFIELD: Will you join us, Dido? (no response) Dido?
DIDO: I..I am terribly light headed this morning, Mamaa. I should like to take rest if it would not displease you.
LADY MANSFIELD: Oh dear! Unwell? And just as we are to announce your news!
DIDO: Harry! Harry!
DIDO (CONT'D): Harry, I need your help. I need you to take me somewhere.
HARRY: Alone, Miss?
DIDO: I shall not be alone, I shall be with you. (off Harry, reticent) Please - Harry. If you don't take me, I shall be forced to go alone.
HARRY: Mr Davinier?
JOHN: Harry?
JOHN: Miss Lindsay!
JOHN (CONT'D): Mr Davinier.
JOHN: I didn't expect...! Are you to come inside?...Are...?
DIDO: No...It would be dangerous.
JOHN: (feeling foolish) Yes. Indeed.
DIDO: Oh Mr Davinier...I am so proud of you. I am so proud of what you are doing and...achieving.
JOHN: No. We've achieved little....
DIDO: At least thirty per cent of insurers are with you! It is a start. It is a real start.
DIDO (CONT'D): I have something to show you.
DIDO (CONT'D): It is said all of the ship's papers have been `lost'... but...here...I found these in Papaa's library.
JOHN: What are they?
DIDO: Papaa's notes on the ship's log. It seems the First Mate has come forward with it - one Mr Stubbs. I could not find the log itself, but look at Papaa's markings - See the map positions - From December 29th, Captain Collingwood and his men directed the ship past no less than eight ports where, you see.... (she points to map) ...there was every opportunity to stop and replenish the ship's water supplies.
JOHN: Good Lord!
DIDO: And they did not! They either ignored the possibilities, or they were never in need.
JOHN: This...This is remarkable.
DIDO: Is it? Perhaps if you made these facts known, Mr Davinier
JOHN: But this places you in an impossible position with Lord Mansfield.
DIDO: What is the alternative?
JOHN: Walk with me, Miss Lindsay. The back of the Inn has the canals, (he laughs) Nobody but blind drunks.
LORD MANSFIELD: Where is everybody, Mabel? The carriages are gone.
MABEL: Lady Mansfield and Miss Murray are out calling, your lordship.
LORD MANSFIELD: And Dido also?
MABEL: Erm...I believe so.
LORD MANSFIELD: Well is she, or isn't she?
MABEL: Yes. She is, M'lord.
DIDO: Papaa would rather I see no ill, as though by ignoring it, it some how escapes me - perhaps by position but not...not by blood
JOHN: (conciliatory) The fault was never with you.
JOHN (CONT'D): (unsure) Miss Lindsay?
DIDO: Just as in life, we are no better in paintings...
JOHN: You were afraid.
DIDO: Afraid?
JOHN: To be painted - to be painted beside Miss Murray (off her discomfort ) And I ridiculed you. (swallows hard) I feel ashamed.
DIDO: Do not feel ashamed. (she observes him) Elizabeth said something when we arrived in London. She said: (recounting) we are but their property.
JOHN: Whose?
DIDO: Gentlemen's. We women are but the property of gentlemen. That is the way it is, in law and in life, is it not?
DIDO (CONT'D): And it came into my head that I have been blessed with freedom twice over? As a negro and as a woman?
JOHN: I suppose you have, yes!
DIDO: Or have I? ((her mind ticks over) Must not a lady marry, even if she is financially secure? For who is she, without a husband of consequence? (she ponders) It seems silly - like a free negro who begs for a master!
JOHN: Unless she marries her equal. Her true equal - A man who respects her.
DIDO: I remember my Papaa's eyes. They were kind, gentle... a little like yours...
JOHN: Mine?
DIDO: (embarrassed) I mean...in colour. Grey. (long beat) He showed me much love, though I knew him only a few hours.
JOHN: That is terribly moving. (off her reaction) What of your mother?
DIDO: She is a ghost in my life - present in my reflection, in each scowl I receive, yet I know very little of her than the colour she has given me.
JOHN: (moved) Then at the least, you know she was beautiful.
DIDO: I had never felt it.
JOHN: Had?
DIDO: I am to marry, shortly - Mr Ashford.
JOHN: Oh!
DIDO: He is amiable and of good family.
JOHN: Is it...what you want?
DIDO: The alternative is to replace Lady Mary in her responsibilities at Kenwood.
JOHN: But she is a spinster.
DIDO: Papaa did not trust I could achieve a match that might raise my rank - or even equal it.
JOHN: You...are above reducing yourself for the sake of rank.
JOHN (CONT'D): I pray he would marry you without a penny to your name - for that is a man who will truly treasure you!
JOHN (CONT'D): I will take you back to your coach.
DIDO: Is anyone home, Mabel?
MABEL: Lord Mansfield. (Dido's heart plummets) I said you were out with Lady Mansfield and Miss Murray
ELIZABETH: Urghhh! What if I shall never find someone so...so incomparably suitable...and wealthy?!
DIDO: What if he is suitable but you do not feel...`yourself' with him?
ELIZABETH: Oh Dido! He understood me. (beat) And whenever...whenever... he looked at me...I somehow felt better in this world...
ELIZABETH (CONT'D): I am convinced his affections were growing...and I feel certain of my own love.
DIDO: Oh Bette, stop it! It is NOT love!!
ELIZABETH: Dido! You stop it, won't you? You know no more of love than I myself, do you?! (deliberately pointed) Do you Dido?
DIDO: No.
ELIZABETH: Then what better right do you have to name what I am feeling than me?
LADY MANSFIELD: How charming. Is that not charming, Elizabeth? And tell me, are you an only son?
GENTLEMAN 1: I have six brothers, madam.
LADY MANSFIELD: SIX! Goodness!...all..?
GENTLEMAN 1: ...all older, madam, yes.
LADY MANSFIELD: Is that not a most fascinating display?
BARONESS VERNON: Oh how dreadfully wonderful Lady M. Your girl is a picture...an utter picture! With her...'intended'?
LADY MANSFIELD: Indeed, Baroness Vernon.
BARONESS VERNON: (re. ELIZABETH) AND I see the other does not give up...so terribly endearing!
BARONESS VERNON (CONT'D): Now has she met Mr Willoughby...
BARONESS VERNON (CONT'D): A very eligible widower - Three thousand yearly and no heir...yet!
BARONESS VERNON (CONT'D): Mr Francis, Mr Smith...!!! You must meet the Mansfield girl! (She mouths) Still available!!
ELIZABETH: (anxious) Mamaa, Mr Vaughan approaches.
LADY MANSFIELD: Now I have checked and he has no London home, but I have good information he achieves an income no less than four thousand a year!
MR VAUGHAN: Miss Murray. Lady Mansfield.
MR VAUGHAN (CONT'D): I trust your stay in London is proving pleasant, Miss Murray.
ELIZABETH: (earnest) Oh most certainly.
MR VAUGHAN: Miss Murray, I wonder, if you might permit me to call upon you at home, sometime?
ELIZABETH: Oh!
MR VAUGHAN: With her Ladyship's permission?
LADY MANSFIELD: I shall make arrangements.
LADY ASHFORD: A pity Lady Mansfield and I could not do business on James and Miss Murray.
LADY MARY: A greater pity you rejected her.
LADY ASHFORD: Let us not dwell on the unfortunate. Oliver and Miss Lindsay are a blissful match. Tell me, when exactly does she receive her inheritance?
JAMES ASHFORD.: Miss Lindsay. Not Husband hunting, are we? (off Dido's disdain) Good Lord, I forgot - you have ensnared my brother. Now is he to share his dining room with you, as well as his bed??
DIDO: Oh, Mr James, your manners are as poor as your brother's finances.
JAMES: And you are foolish enough to marry him. I on the other have no better use for your impoverished cousin!...(beat)...Though she does make for rather amusing sport!
DIDO: That is painful, sir.
JAMES: Have you never been manhandled?
DIDO: It is not in my repertoire to keep company with beasts.
DIDO (CONT'D): How dare you? HOW DARE YOU!
JAMES: With ease.
JAMES (CONT'D): You will destroy us. You will destroy the entire order of our family.
LADY ASHFORD: Oliver has been searching for you!
LADY MANSFIELD: Are you unwell, my dear?
ELIZABETH: Oh!..Mr James!
ELIZABETH (CONT'D): Lady Ashford, you had not mentioned Mr James was to attend!
LADY ASHFORD: Surprisingly.
JAMES: Ladies. (off Dido's reaction) Miss Murray.
JOHN: I had never imagined myself to be married. But my aunt is determined. It is true that if one were to count, I had not even been acquainted with Miss Beresford on three occasions.
DIDO: Is she not terribly disappointed that you will not return to Hampstead?
JOHN: (ironic) my Aunt?
JOHN (CONT'D)JOHN: I doubt Miss Beresford has anymore wish to marry me than I her. I should rather make a nuisance of myself alone in London, than in an unwanted marriage in Hampstead...
JOHN: Were you a curious child?
DIDO: Completely. Elizabeth, always asked the questions for me... then took blame for the impropriety when in fact she was protecting me! Dear, dear Bette.
DIDO: ...I find myself unable to sleep. Papaa is to finally speak in a few days and...well...
JOHN: It is quite extraordinary ...but I fear...I fear despite persuasive argument...your Papaa has not been moved. (despondent) I am not certain he is ready to go against the traders - they are some of the most powerful in these Isles - theirs are the finances that hold up England, after all. The enemies of any man who stood against the trade would be vicious.
DIDO: And yet if he does...stand up...IF he speaks the words and condemns the trade...The Lord Chief Justice of England...it may be impossible for the slave laws of England and its colonies to remain absolute. Is that correct?
JOHN: That...that is a fact.
ELIZABETH: I have heard nothing from him, since Vauxhall, Dido. I was certain an announcement was to be made any day...that he meant it this time!
DIDO: Then he is not a man of his word.
DIDO (CONT'D): I will help you find the kindest most wonderful of husbands. (off Bette's sadness) And I shall ask Papaa to use a portion of my inheritance for your dowry.
ELIZABETH: You would do that? For me?
DIDO: Bette, anything for you!
ELIZABETH: Dido...
ELIZABETH (CONT'D): I have been of the mind these last few days...that it is my little means that has delayed James in making his approach.
DIDO: I think you may be right.
ELIZABETH: Then I cannot thank you enough.
DIDO: Bette...?
ELIZABETH: I will ask Papaa to write immediately to Lady Ashford.
DIDO: No!
ELIZABETH: No?
DIDO: James Ashford is not kind. He is not a man to give your life or dowry to.
ELIZABETH: Then your gift comes with conditions.
DIDO: No!
ELIZABETH: What then?
DIDO: I am trying...trying to make you see. He is not... appropriate!
ELIZABETH: Appropriate? The brother of the man you are to marry is not `appropriate' for me?
DIDO: He does not desire you, Bette! At least, even if he does, you would regret such a mistake. (off Bette's silence) He...he laid his hands on me, Bette - in the most un-gentlemanly fashion.
ELIZABETH: Why should you say such a thing?
DIDO: He hurt me.
ELIZABETH: You are a liar!
DIDO: Why...why would I lie to you?
ELIZABETH: I don't know - but do you not see? Have you never been able to see? He would never touch you...!
DIDO: Bette...
ELIZABETH: You are beneath him!
DIDO: I am beneath him??
ELIZABETH: Yes. You...you are...
DIDO: What! Tell me! What am I, Bette?
ELIZABETH: ...You...you are....(courage leaves her)...You are illegitimate!!
ELIZABETH (CONT'D): Have you never wondered why you are not permitted to eat with our guests?
DIDO: My mother and father never married - you are correct. But my father acknowledged me as his child. (beat) It is yours who refuses to legitimise your position, Bette - that is why you are poor! And that is why it is not me who is beneath Mr James, Bette. It is not me!
MABEL: (worried whisper) Miss Lindsay. Are you out again?
DIDO: (terrified) Papaa...?
LORD MANSFIELD: This man's ambitions include you. You will endure shame and risk your position for a man without name, who will sully yours and drag your reputation to the gutter!
JOHN: (bitter and humiliated) I take great offence in your summation of my character without ever even taking a moment to know me. Where is your right?
LORD MANSFIELD: ...I have EVERY right...!
JOHN: ...No! That you will never have! Not until you cease from judging the entire world as those above and those below and begin to see people as PEOPLE! Human beings, who think and feel no more or less than you do!
LORD MANSFIELD: I know there is a lady in Belsize who is waiting to be your wife.
JOHN: No! I have an ambitious aunt in Belsize, who like you, assumes reputation and fortune are all that life depends on, and despises love as though it were the devil's own creation!
LORD MANSFIELD: Love? You claim love....??
DIDO: NO! STOP! Papaa, you must stop!
JOHN: Yes...yes I love her! I love her with every breath I breathe.
DIDO: Go John.   You do not deserve this.
DIDO (CONT'D): Captain Sir John Lindsay would never have behaved like this.
LORD MANSFIELD: Captain Sir John Lindsay would never behave like this because he was never HERE!...You are destroying your possibilities with the only gentleman who will consider you. (searching her, hard) Is that what you want?
LORD MANSFIELD: Arrogant...parasite! HE is filling her with worthless ideals. He wants to `make the world a better place'!...
LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D): He is laughing at us! His childish campaign simply adds to my already rampant ridicule in the gossip pamphlets and now...! As though he were some kind of...saint, immune from reproach!
LADY MANSFIELD: You said something identical, once.
LADY MANSFIELD (CONT'D): That you wanted to change the world! Quite some time before you entered your chambers, of course. Defiant, principled...driven. (off Lord M)
LADY MANSFIELD (CONT'D): Desperate to seal your position among the establishment but always a little too radical for them.
LORD MANSFIELD: I never broke the rules.
LADY MANSFIELD: Did you not? You simply became powerful enough to make new ones. (off his silence) I always felt you already loved me when I gave you my hand. Not that you said it but... something in the way you looked at me.
LADY MANSFIELD (CONT'D): That we were a good match - that was of no doubt...But I am not sure I could have married a gentleman without that...`thing' in his eye...without knowing - privately - that my heart stopped a moment each time he looked at me
LADY MANSFIELD (CONT'D): It is possible that even you cannot fight change, my darling... And sometimes you cannot fight it because you are a part of it.
LADY MANSFIELD (CONT'D): Do you love her?
LORD MANSFIELD: As though she were created of you and I...(poignant)...And that is why I simply do not want to see her diminished.
LADY MARY: The niece of the Marquess of Winchester. Mr James Ashford is to marry the niece of the Marquess of Winchester.
LADY MARY (CONT'D): I am reading it here.
LADY MANSFIELD: (sardonic) That shall render your future mother-in-law ecstatic, Dido.
ELIZABETH: Don't you dare say a word.
DIDO: I won't.
ELIZABETH: Why! Why do they ALWAYS do that!!
DIDO: Who, Bette?
ELIZABETH: Men! They leave and never come back!
ELIZABETH: I saw you with him, that day.   At the pleasure garden.
DIDO: You said nothing.
ELIZABETH: I wanted you to tell me. To trust me.
DIDO: I should have.
ELIZABETH: You know, if I had your choice, I would choose...the man I loved (off Dido, sad) I simply hope he is worth it.
LADY ASHFORD: I am not in the habit of requiring explanation more than TWICE! But on this occasion, you will have to forgive me.
LORD MANSFIELD: (burdened) Lady Ashford there is little point in repetition...
LADY ASHFORD: Then let me be clear that I have understood. Your charge - your mulatto charge...
LADY MANSFIELD: (fiercely protective) That is enough!
OLIVER: (to Lady Mansfield) Is it not true enough, your ladyship?!!
LADY ASHFORD: ...whose unfortunate circumstances of birth, we chose to forgive - has decided she no longer wishes the match with my son - a gentleman and an officer.
OLIVER: Why, Miss Lindsay?
LADY ASHFORD: (poignant and pained) Do you feel I have any lesser need to ensure my child's wellbeing and future than you?...(beat)...Does she still have a tongue?
DIDO: I have a tongue, Madam. Though yours explains well enough why I may not marry your son...beat)... You view my circumstances as unfortunate, though I cannot claim even a portion of the misfortune of those to whom I most closely resemble.
DIDO (CONT'D): My greatest misfortune would be to marry into a family who will carry me as their shame - as I have been required to carry my own mother.
DIDO (CONT'D): Her apparent crime, to be born negro, and mine - to be the evidence. (beat) Since I wish to deny her no more than I wish to deny myself, you will pardon me for wanting a husband who feels `forgiveness' of my bloodline is both unnecessary and without grace.
DIDO: Why did I, slave, beyond my lot aspire..
LORD MANSFIELD (OOV): It will hang at Kenwood.
DIDO: Will it?
LORD MANSFIELD: Why should that surprise you?
DIDO: Why should it not?
LORD MANSFIELD: What are you reading?
DIDO: Poetry. A gentleman named Thomas Day. He speaks of a slave who agreed to marry a free woman. A voice to people...people like my mother - who do not have one.
LORD MANSFIELD: You find yourself in such writing?
DIDO: I don't know that I find myself anywhere. I have no place that I may claim.
LORD MANSFIELD: What is it that you want, Dido? What precisely are you searching for? I enabled every rule of heritage so that you could know exactly where you belong. Yet little appears enough for you!
DIDO: Papaa, you enabled every rule, but you had to overlook just as many to raise me within good society. And what if there were not a rule Papaa? What if that rule that allowed you to take me did not exist? Would you have returned me to the slums?
DIDO (CONT'D): You are courageous. When it comes to the matters you believe in, society is inconsequential. You break EVERY rule when it matters enough. Papaa, I am the evidence. (OFF the painting) This painting...is the evidence.
LORD MAYOR: Look at them - For and against at each other's throats! How on earth did the damn quakers find their way into here!..(beat)..You are a brave man, negotiating these quarters on the eve of your judgement.
LORD MANSFIELD: You did not become Lord Mayor through being a coward.
LORD MAYOR: Finally you are to speak, then. If England is destroyed we shall blame you!
JOHN (OOV): ...But religion cannot be the only guardian of our morality.
YOUNG MAN 1: Of course not - there is self- responsibility?
JOHN: And failing that does the law not have a duty?
JOHN (CONT'D): Do the bench and parliament not have a duty to uphold and create the laws, to set the precedents that progress our morality, not retard it! If not to protect us from others, then to protect us from ourselves! Laws that allow us to diminish the humanity of anybody, are not laws - they are frameworks for crime.
JOHN (CONT'D): A constitution can never be finite - surely as humanity evolves so too must its laws. And frankly I really do not care if you as an individual are without character or conscience - But a land whose laws contain neither - whose laws sanction not control the barbarous among its citizens - that is a country whose hope is lost.
LORD MANSFIELD: Why does it matter to you so?
JOHN: M'lord..! It..it is a misuse of the clause. It is not for human lives. It is for goods.. Chattel...
LORD MANSFIELD: (factual) It is for property!
JOHN: I HAVE SEEN YOUR NOTES!! If they wanted water they could have had it!
LORD MANSFIELD: Dido.
JOHN: If you find for the traders, you will be formalizing in law the concept of insuring `human' cargo.
LORD MANSFIELD: That is correct!...(to his driver)...Drive!
JOHN: Then know that when you are gone, your legacy will be to have left Miss Lindsay in a world that says she may be worth more dead, than alive.
LORD MANSFIELD: She is not a slave.
JOHN: By the very grace of God!
LORD MANSFIELD: This is not about Miss Lindsay.
JOHN: Of course it is! It's about all of us. It's about everything... everything that is important!
LORD MANSFIELD: Mr Davinier, the world is a devastating place. You must learn to protect your emotions if you are to prevent matters of both law..and love from devastating you.
LADY MANSFIELD: Smooth your dress, young lady!
MR VAUGHAN (OOV): Lady Mansfield...Miss Murray...
LADY MANSFIELD: Mr Vaughan, how kind of you to come.
ELIZABETH: I have thought of nothing else but showing you Aunt Mary's chrysanthemums, Mr Vaughan.
MR VAUGHAN: What a pleasure, Miss Murray.
ELIZABETH: You too Mamaa.
HARRY: NO! Never again!
DIDO: Fine! Then step down and allow me to take the reigns.
HARRY: Had I known you were to be such trouble, I'd `ave driven off before Captain Sir John Lindsay bought you to my carriage!
CLERK: Silence in the court!
LORD MANSFIELD: Whether the `jettison clause' of Marine Insurance Law may be brought to bear in this appeal. This is the question. That is, first: whether the slaves were drowned as an anticipatory act. An act to avoid the disease caused by their
LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D): journey, killing them once on shore, and at their destination...depriving the slave owners of any compensation.
LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D): Or secondly: whether they were `jettisoned' as cargo! To save captain and crew from certain death, when the extended journey threatened shortage of drinking-water. (steely eyed) Let me be clear, loss of water on a ship constitutes a singularly dangerous affair - insurrection of thirsty and hostile slaves at its extreme - and an impossible task to share diminished water reserve, among all those living, at best. Each implies severe threat to the lives of the seamen. In such circumstances our law is transparent and equivocal - the jettisoning of enslaved cargo ...IS legal! (he spells it out) And in these circumstances, combined with unavoidable loss of water, our laws leave the ship-owners securely within their rights to make a claim ...and behoves the insurers to pay losses.
DIDO: No!
LORD MANSFIELD: The ship's owners chose a tight `packing fashion' to transport the slaves...A popular fashion of transportation that is known for causing death and disease.
LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D): This choice of laying the slaves tightly together is undertaken at the Captain's own risk. In the event that over packing renders an avoidable lack of drinking water on board a protracted journey, such a decision may be viewed as simple `bad management' on a
LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D): Captain's part, and further, weigh as his own risk. An extended journey - one in which the destination is overshot may also be viewed as the captain's own mismanagement.
LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D): It is not legal...to discharge lives from a ship into the waters, to prevent those lives dying on land, and to facilitate insurance compensation. Whether they be the lives of horses... or human beings ...slaves or otherwise - It is not legal, neither is it right.
LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D): Further, the claim of shortage of water is illegitimate shown by the evidence put forward. To my mind, it is clear a fraud has been committed in claiming insurance on slaves who were...drowned solely for financial gain.
LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D): It is my opinion, that the state of slavery is so odious a position that nothing may support it. This case has displayed with searing clarity the depravity of any such nation whose choice is to practice it. You may be certain that I have laboured over my judgement and statements today and am in full understanding of all of the ramifications. Justice be done,though the heavens may fall.
LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D): I find in favour of the insurers and overturn the decision of the lower court. I order a retrial.
CLERK: All rise!
DIDO: You may not blame Mr Davinier ...My attendance today is absolutely at my own volition ...for matters which concern me.
LORD MANSFIELD: I am fully aware, Dido.
JOHN: M'Lord...I am inspired by your decision today. We will not go backwards from here.
LORD MANSFIELD: (burdened) History will judge if your optimism is warranted...(beat)... You are a man of conviction.
JOHN: I am trying to be.
LORD MANSFIELD: Then your efforts are not in vain.
LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D): I have not changed my mind. She is to marry a gentleman.
DIDO: And Mr Davinier is not a gentleman?
LORD MANSFIELD: He is...indeed...Dido. (he speaks carefully) And that is why he ought to have a job befitting one.
DIDO: (a whisper - defiant) My affections are with him, Papaa. I wish for nothing... nothing, if not to be his wife.
LORD MANSFIELD: If you would Mr Davinier, I would like you to attend my chambers in the morning. There are matters I would like you to assist me with.
JOHN: Your Lordship?
LORD MANSFIELD: And if you think it a good idea...I wish to facilitate your entry to the Inns of Court.
JOHN: (tentative) That is to serve my qualification to The Bar?
LORD MANSFIELD: Indeed...(humbled)...Capabilities such as yours are clearly deserving of such considerations.
JOHN: I..I think it a very good idea, sir.
JOHN (CONT'D): Can it be true?
DIDO: Of course. He sees what I see. His words were as clear as...
JOHN: No! That your feelings for me are so? That you would be my wife..? (off her reaction, ) Because, I cannot conceive of a life without you...and if...if such were all that were before me, Miss Lindsay, then my heart would never beat the same again.
DIDO: It is not. It is not all that is before you Mr Davinier... (begins sobbing) I love you...for all that you are, and with all..all that I am.
