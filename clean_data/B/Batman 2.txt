BATMAN 2: Screenplay By Sam Hamm
COP: What the hell -- ?
COP WITH MIKE: Yeah, you heard me.  Snowmobiles! (pause) So what do we do?  Chase 'em on foot??
COP I: ...That was
COP I: ...Merry Christmas.
COP II: Gift-wrapped and everything.
GORDON: After a high-speed chase -- over $750,000 in precious jewels were recovered intact by the police force -- working in concert with Batman.
GORDON: I would like to stress -- that while this city enjoys a special relationship with Batman -- (louder) -- we do not condone vigilantism -- (practically screaming)
SEKOWSKY: And hey!  Where does this -- (BLEEP; expletive deleted) -- Gordon get off calling us ? We're not breakin' any laws.  We're a group of concerned citizens, that's all -- just like Batman.
WOMAN IN CROWD: You people are nothing but hoodlums!
SEKOWSKY: Hey, lady -- we're out here on patrol riskin' our necks to protect old biddies like you. (into mike) If this lame-o Gordon could do his job -- SEKOWSKY (on TV) We're provin' that the spirit of Batman is alive in this city.  We're gonna take back the streets!
ALFRED: Sir?  -- MASTER BRUCE??
BRUCE: I'm not deaf, Alfred.  I hear you.
ALFRED: I took the liberty of preparing tea. (indicating tbe monitors) I take it you've been watching the news?
BRUCE: Yeah...lot of crazy people in this world.
ALFRED: I should inform you...Christmas is approaching, and we've received our annual solicitation from the Fireman's Toy Fund. (eyeing the equipment) If I may inquire...?
BRUCE: Oh, yeah.  Watch this.
ALFRED: Most ingenious, sir.  What exactly
BRUCE: What does it look like?
ALFRED: To the untrained eye, sir, it looks remarkably like...the skeleton of an umbrella.
BRUCE: Good guess, Alfred.  That's exactly right.
ALFRED: Splendid, sir, and if I may say, I'm glad you're putting your time to such productive use. (beat) Now -- the Toy Fund.  Our contribution last year was a half-million dollars...
BRUCE: We can do better than that.
ALFRED: Then there's the foster-parents program... the Gotham homeless crusade... ALFRED (cont.) Is something troubling you, sir?
BRUCE: Yeah...the holidays, I guess.  Always gets me thinking about... (he changes the subject) And to tell you the truth, I'm a little -- concerned about Vicki.
ALFRED: Miss Vale, sir...?
BRUCE: Yeah.  I've been thinking about it lately. Thinking about it a lot... (gravely; shaking his head) ...and I still can't figure out what to get her for Christmas.
GUARD: Up and at 'em, Pengy.  -- Pengy? GUARD (cont.) Boniface...
PAROLE OFFICER: You want to return the money you stole.
BONIFACE: Intact.  The map will show you where it's buried.
PAROLE OFFICER II: Why this sudden change of heart?
MR. BONIFACE: Gentlemen, I want my debt to be repaid in full.  I want to be a part of civilized society! (oozing sincerity) Prison life is not for me.  The guilt, the fear, the constant shame...one meets a disturbingly low class of people.
PAROLE OFFICER II: Sure, but -- forty-two million dollars??
WARDEN: His record's clean.  Thirteen years without an incident.
ATTORNEY: I'd like to point out, my client's put his time to good use.  A student of ornithology...articles published in several respected journals...
MR. BONIFACE: Birds, yes.  My only source of solace.
PAROLE OFFICER: In light of this rather extraordinary gesture, I see no reason not to endorse your application for parole.
BONIFACE: Thank you, sir.  You won't regret it.
MR. BONIFACE: --
T-BONE: Shit, Pengy.  I let 'em
MR. BONIFACE: Hermione.  My canary.  It's the dead of winter!
T-BONE: They were all cooped up.  With you leaving and all -- seemed like the humane thing to do.
MR. BONIFACE: I see.  -- You might as well have this.  I won't be needing it...
T-BONE: Well, thanks, Pengy.  No hard feelings. (chuckling to himself) Y'know, I'm gonna miss that pudgy little ass of yours.
MR. BONIFACE: You won't miss it long.
FRICK: Welcome back, Mr. Boniface.
PENGUIN: Mr. Frick.  Mr. Frack.  Our years of planning are about to pay off.
PENGUIN: I take it they found the money all right?
FRACK: We buried it exactly as you specified.
PENGUIN: How much have we got left?
FRICK: Let's see -- an initial capitalization of 42 million and change, compounded over thirteen years, at an annual return of just under sixteen percent --
PENGUIN: Fine, fine.  How
FRICK: Seventy-nine million.  -- Excluding the sum we buried.
PENGUIN: Speaking of burials...
VICKI: Guess what, Alfred.  I think I found a present for Bruce. VICKI (cont.) Skis.  -- Don't let on, okay?
ALFRED: He won't hear a word of it from me.
VICKI: He's such a nightmare to shop for.  -- What do you get him year after year, Alfred?
ALFRED: I find you can't go wrong with surveillance equipment.  Let me put this under the tree...
VICKI: Not so fast.
ALFRED: Why, Miss Vale -- !
VOICE FROM BEHIND: What's all this?
VICKI: Don't look.  It's your present.
BRUCE: What'd you get me?  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?
VICKI: I'm going to give you the happiest Christmas you've ever had.
VICKI: Homeless. (beat) I was just down here Tuesday.  Seems like there's more every day. VICKI (cont.) Christmas time.  And they say there's over a thousand people living in the park already.
BRUCE: -- Yeah.
VICKI: They're already razing the tenements and SRO's downtown.  These people don't have anyplace else to go. (beat) If the city starts selling off the park...
BRUCE: -- Yeah.  I guess I'll pass on dessert.
VICKI: Bruce, you do a lot more than most people even dream of.
BRUCE: Sure.  Comes off the top of my taxes --
VICKI: That's not what I meant.
BRUCE: -- What I "do" doesn't come close to the root of the problem, Vicki. (long pause) I'm just a Band-Aid.
VOICE FROM BEHIND: Bruce!  It's been ages!
BRUCE: Randall.  You remember Vicki.  -- How's the construction business?
SHAW: The park tower?  All systems go. can get the junkies and winos cleared out... (a big grin) Not too late to get in on the deal.
BRUCE: I'll think about it.
SHAW: Say, Walter Barrett's due back from Europe.  We should all get together at the club. (clapping him on the shoulder) Nice to see you again,  Miss Veal.
VICKI: What a pig.
BRUCE: I've known him since he was seven years old.  He was a pig then too.
VICKI: Now he wants to gobble up the (shivering) Bruce -- isn't there something you can do about people like that?
BRUCE: What, tie him up with a bat-rope?
VICKI: No, you idiot.  I meant
RED BERET I: We were on patrol.  Saw the whole thing.
JOGGER: I was attacked.  Three men in ski masks --
COP I: And these two broke it up?
JOGGER: These two??  They ran like rabbits.  I never saw anybody take off so --
RED BERET II: Hey!  Somebody had to go for the cops.
COP II: You.  SHUT UP, all right?? (to the JOGGER) Lady, who was it that bailed you out??
JOGGER: A just came out of nowhere and -- tore into 'em. (shaking her head) It was so quick I didn't even see his face.
RED BERET I: Dumb shit.  Shouldn'ta been jogging in the park at night anyway. (sullenly) Look around you.  It's fulla bums.
BRUCE: Nice outfit.
RED BERET I: Piss off, geek.
ANCHORWOMAN: ...and tomorrow, the city's power elite will be turning out in force to greet millionaire industrialist Walter Barrett, who returns to Gotham after a five-year stay in Europe...
RICKY: Yo.  Ricky here.  What's the haps? RICKY (cont.) Midnight.  No sweat.  See you then.
SELINA: Well.  "Ricky," is it?
RICKY: How'd you know that?
SELINA: I heard you on the phone.  Talking to your girlfriend.
RICKY: Girlfriend?  No, no.  That was
SELINA: If you've got time for a little pleasure ...maybe you'd like to buy me a drink.
RICKY: Jeez -- they look almost real.
SELINA: Why wouldn't they be?
RICKY: You'd have to be crazy.  Nobody'd wear the real thing to a dive like this.
SELINA: Oh, they're real, all right.  So are these. SELINA (cont.) Weren't we going to have a drink?
DOCK GOON I: Where's that goddam Ricky?
DOCK GOON II: Probably out gettin' laid.  And here we are freezin' our balls off...
BOAT THUG I: You pick.
LIEUTENANT: It's pure.
CHIEF GOON (O.S.): Let's do it.
BOAT THUG I: Hold it.  Let's see the money.
BOAT THUG I: Go after it.  Get the money.  GO!!
BOAT THUG I: Soltar las amarras!  -- CAST OFF!!
PUNK: Murcielago.  MURCIELAGO!!
FRICK: Mr. Boniface?  Your...visitor has arrived.
PENGUIN: Thank you, Mr. Frick.  Show her in.
PENGUIN: Ah, Miss Kyle!  At last we meet.
SELINA: At last we meet.  -- Pigeons?
PENGUIN: Yes, they're common birds -- dirty, stupid, unattractive -- but they're very obedient, and they do crap on people's heads.  May I? PENGUIN (cont.) I see your reputation was not exaggerated.
SELINA: I've located the others.  All but one. (shivering) I'm surprised you don't catch pneumonia -- !
PENGUIN: My normal body temperature is ninety-two degrees.  Germs find me inhospitable.
SELINA: I see why they call you the Penguin.
PENGUIN: They may call me that...but rarely more than once.  Champagne? PENGUIN (cont.) My dear.  Here's to the second biggest crime in the history of Gotham City.
BULLOCK: It wasn't about the drugs.  Whoever it was left thirty kilos sitting on the docks. JULIO (filter) Un silueta negra -- con colmillos, y garras -- el demonio.  El murcielago.
GORDON: What's that he keeps saying?
BULLOCK: "Murcielago."  -- Bat.
GORDON: Nonsense.  That dock looked like a slaughter-house.  Batman's never committed murder.
BULLOCK: We did find this in his back pocket.
POLICEMAN: Commissioner?  We've got Barrett.
BARRETT: Fine welcome.  These storm troopers of yours dragged me away from my coming-home party! (beat) I'd like to know the meaning of this --
GORDON: I'd like to know how thirty kilos of pure cocaine wound up concealed in your personal effects.
BARRETT: Gordon -- I come from one of the oldest and most influential familles in Gotham. If you plan to accuse me of smuggling drugs, be my guest. (long, menacing pause) I'll have your badge before you leave this room.
GORDON: Book the son of a bitch.
BARRETT: I believe I'm still entitled to a phone call.
SHAW: Come on!  Let's move it!  We're an hour behind as it is!!
SHAW: Jesus Christ, that's Bruce Wayne's bimbo!
HARDHAT: Phone call, Mr. Shaw.  Guy said it's urgent.
SHAW: Hold the ball.  I wanna hear it crash.
BARRETT: It's me, Randall -- Walter Barrett.  I want you to call my attorney.  That was my shipment they busted up last night.
SHAW: Jesus, Walter, I -- (suddenly puzzled) Why are you calling me??
BARRETT: It's worse than that.  Somebody took my raven.
SCHULTZ: Great stuff, but we're looking at a shitfight with our beloved publisher.  He and Shaw... (crossing his fingers) Old money sticks together.
VICKI: I'd sure like to know what shook him up so.  He was out of there like a scared rabbit...
WILK: Got a blind tip from downtown.  You know that massacre on the docks?  Batman.
EDITOR: Whoa!  Is this on the level?
WILK: Cops even got a note.  "Those who feed on the soul of Gotham will suffer my wrath!" (grinning; to VICKI) Sounds like your pal's cranked it up a notch.
VICKI: Seen the late edition?
ALFRED: I'm afraid so, Miss Vale.  Master Bruce is sequestered in the cave. ENVIRONMENTALIST (on TV) Walter Barrett's no saint.  His factories have been dumping poison into the air and water for years.  If he is mixed up with drugs... PUNDIT (on TV) That's not the issue.  The issue is, do we entrust our public safety to some...masked vigilante.  Does Batman have a license to kill?
ALFRED: Ah, the public.  Dishearteningly fickle. MIKE SEKOWSKY (on TV) Yo, here's the tip, man.  Drug dealers are scum.  If Batman did wax these punks...SO WHAT?  They deserved it!  End of discussion. GORDON (O.S.; filter) Anyone could've written that note.
CITY OFFICIAL I: And I suppose anyone could've taken out a boatload of armed thugs.  A dozen men, Jim -- murdered in cold blood --
GORDON: Before we forget, Batman's saved hundreds of lives!
CITY OFFICIAL II: He's still a vigilante.  We don't know who he is, where he comes from, why he does it...
CITY OFFICIAL I: Street punks are one thing, Jim.  This is Walter Barrett -- a personal friend of mine!
CITY OFFCIAL II: You've gotta bring him in, Jim -- at least for questioning.  It would sure help if we could get that mask off...
BRUCE: Ladies and gentlemen...I've been framed.
COP: One-delta-niner -- 10-80 on Riverview north-bound at 33rd -- 10-78, repeat
10-78.: VOICE ON RADIO (filter) 10-4, one-delta-niner -- that's a 10-37, repeat 10-37.  Backup on the way.
BATMAN: Evasive.
WOMAN: It's a fake.
SHAW: Hmm.  It cost me a half a million dollars. You're sure?
WOMAN: Absolutely.  You see, I...happen to know where the real one is stashed.
SHAW: I guess you'd know.  I have some "friends" in the art world.  They say that -- for certain hard-to-get items -- you're the one to call.
WOMAN (O.S.): How flattering.
SHAW: They say for the right price...you could steal Michelangelo off the Sistine Chapel Wall.
WOMAN (O.S.): Mr. Shaw.  Do you believe everything you hear?
SHAW: Oh, I'm not one to judge.  I admire people who take what they want.  I'm just curious how you do it.
SELINA: I find that the old methods work best.
SHAW: Hey, what are you doing -- ?
SELINA: You're very inquisitive.  You'll just have to be disciplined.
SHAW: You know, I've...I've never really done this kind of thing before.
SELINA: I think people should indulge their fantasies.  Don't you?
SHAW: Hey, what are those -- what are you --
COP: Hey.  You see what I saw...?
BULLOCK: It's Randall Shaw.  Torn to ribbons.  -- We just made Batman up on the roof.
GORDON: Oh God.
VICKI: Please, just one.  It's important for people to see what's happening.
HOMELESS MAN: They don't want to see us, lady.  They just want us gone -- out of sight, and out of mind. (mumbling as he wanders off) Get worse before it gets better.  It always does.
VICKI: you.  I --
KID: Twenty.
VICKI: What?
KID: Twenty bucks.
VICKI: ...Who
KID: Dick.
WOMAN'S VOICE: Now Hecate.  You don't want that scrawny little bird --
PENGUIN: Do you want me to wring that creature's neck?
SELINA: You try it, I'll do the same to you. (as he grumbles; bemused) I saw him, you know.
PENGUIN: Saw who?
SELINA: Batman.  He was
PENGUIN: (sputtering wildly) Are you sure it was him?  What did he do?
SELINA: He stood on a roof and watched me.  He didn't realize I'd seen him.  I don't think he knew quite what to make of me. (smiling) But he was definitely interested.
PENGUIN: This scheme of yours is backfiring.  We don't need him on our tails.  Do you know how much money is at stake here?
SELINA: Money isn't everything. (casually) What's the point if we can't enjoy ourselves?
VICKI: Six-on-one, and he took 'em all out...then vanished into a drainage pipe -- right next to the statue of General Wayne.
BRUCE: My illustrious great-grandfather.  Think it's the same kid we heard about?
VICKI: Must be.  He reminded me of
BRUCE: -- You (snatching up a paper) Your boss is calling for Gordon's resignation -- unless he brings Batman in for questioning...
BRUCE: I need a good PR man.
NEWS VENDOR: Hey, pal -- you buyin' or borrowin'?
VICKI: That's what happens when you go after the rich and powerful.
BRUCE: Hey, it and powerful --
VICKI: Maybe it's almost...good.  In a weird way. I mean, Shaw, and Barrett -- if people like that were really scared, maybe they'd -- VICKI (cont.) Hey, I'm late for work.  You can read that later.
BRUCE: Quiet.  I'm looking for a personal ad. BRUCE (cont.) "Tall, Dark And Handsome -- You saw me on the roof 12/16.  I was in black; you were too."
VICKI: Is this some kind of bad joke?
BRUCE: It's her.  That is. (reading aloud) "I jumped a bus into Gotham Park hoping you'd follow, but you were too shy..."
VICKI: What does she want -- a date?
BRUCE: She's trying to contact me.  Says she's gonna leave me another ad...
PROVOST: Close the door. (waiting for her to calm down) Your story isn't news.  With Shaw dead --
VICKI: But the project's still going ahead!  If attacking homeless people in the park isn't news, I'd like to know what is --
PROVOST: There's a cape -- killing off Gotham's most prominent citizens!  That's news. (beat) I've known Randall Shaw all my life.  His family is in mourning.  And it just so happens I don't believe in slandering the dead.
VICKI: Mr. Provost -- how much money do you have tied up in the Park Tower project?
PROVOST: Vicki...I'm going to forget you made that remark.  For the sake of your job, I suggest you do the same.
REPORTER I: Mr. Barrett!  Any comment on the arraignment?
REPORTER II: Is it true bail was set at two million dollars?
ATTORNEY: Stand back!  My client has nothing to say at this time!
BARRETT: It's time we called an emergency meeting of the Raven Society.  Get back to me... BARRETT (cont.) Damn pigeons.
DRIVER: Just washed it, too.
ALFRED: The Fluegelheim called again, sir.  They want to know if you'll be attending the opening of the new Egyptian exhibit.
BRUCE: ANCHORWOMAN (on TV) -- and, citing new evidence in the so- called string of "millionaire murders," Police Commissioner J.T. Gordon today swore out a warrant for the arrest of Batman. (beat) We go now live to Mike Sekowsky, spokesperson, Order of the Bat.
SEKOWSKY: Jeez!  Talk about
BRUCE: Well, Alfred, it's official.  I'm a wanted man. (beat) "New evidence"...I've gotta find that woman.  Did you check the personals?
ALFRED: Who's there?
GORDON: Jim Gordon, Alfred.  I've got to see Bruce.
ALFRED: Mr. Wayne will see you, sir.
GORDON: Sorry to bother you.  Bruce -- I'll get right down to it.  You knew Shaw and Barrett --
BRUCE: I saw them occasionally.  We all sat on the board of the Fluegelheim...
GORDON: Did you have any...dealings with them, or --
BRUCE: No.  I never liked the way they did business.
GORDON: The thing is, Bruce, you're all lumped together in the public mind -- the Five Families of Gotham, that sort of thing -- and, uh... (taking a card from his pocket) Harrison Provost got this in the mail.
BRUCE: Then Batman
GORDON: Batman or a damned good imitation.
BRUCE: Well.  He's changed tactics, hasn't he.
GORDON: Shaw, with his high-rises -- Barrett, a druglord, major polluter -- they weren't exactly model citizens.  Who knows, it could be some crazy social-conscience kind of thing.
BRUCE: You mean he's going after...the root of the problem.
GORDON: Let me know if you get one of these. We'll put all our resources at your disposal.
BRUCE: Changed my mind, Alfred.  I'll be dropping in on the Fluegelheim after all.
VICKI: What is it?
BRUCE: I just had a weird sense of
TIPTREE: Harrison -- we really ought to warn Bruce. We owe him that much. PROVOST (cont.) The man's a space cadet.  Let him look out for himself. (as BRUCE arrives; cheerfully) Why, Bruce!  What a delightful surprise.
BRUCE: Good to see you two.  Looks like the Five Families are suddenly down to three. (looking around) In fact, if somebody dropped a bomb on this room right now --
PROVOST: Is that your idea of a joke, Bruce?
BRUCE: Not at all.  Commissioner Gordon seems to think we should all be hiring bodyguards.
BRUCE: Thing is, I can't imagine why Batman would be after us.  Can you?
SELINA: You two look like you need a drink.  -- And is this who I think it is?
PROVOST: Selina Kyle -- Bruce Wayne.
SELINA: Our absentee board member!  I've been wanting to meet you forever.
TIPTREE: Selina's the new Curator of Antiquities. She brought the Temple over block by block --
SELINA: You two won't be terribly upset if I borrow Bruce for a moment, will you? SELINA (cont.) Major contributor.  -- I always seem to wind up in charge of fund-raising...
BRUCE: I can't imagine why.
SELINA: Tax year's almost over, you know.  I hope we can count on your usual generous donation. (indicating PROVOST and TIPTREE) Someone's got to set an example for those two tightwads.
BRUCE: They're proccupied.  This string of murders --
SELINA: I asked them if they'd consider including us in their wills. (chuckling to herself) They didn't seem a bit amused...
SELINA: -- and this is my good friend Bastet, the Egyptian Cat Goddess.
BRUCE: I think we've already met.  -- This is quite an expedition you've put together.
SELINA: I'm glad you think so.  I have to say, Bruce -- you're not at all what I expected.
BRUCE: Sorry to disappoint you.
SELINA: Oh, it's not that.  Not at that I'd always heard you were...
BRUCE: What?
SELINA: Oh...sort of a...
BRUCE: No.  Come on.  What?
BRUCE: Oh.  Selina Kyle -- my friend Vicki Vale.
SELINA: The photographer.  I've seen your pictures in the Gazette.
VICKI: The
SELINA: Oh, that's right.  The What an original dress!
BRUCE: Selina supervised the reconstruction of the temple.  Brought it back from Egypt... stone by stone.
VICKI: Really.  She must be (to SELINA) How'd you get to be in charge of a huge project like this?
SELINA: It was easy.  I slept with the Pharoah. SELINA (cont.) Excuse us, won't you, sweetheart?  We have some boring museum business to talk about. SELINA (cont.) I.  Short leash.
BRUCE: Pull in the claws, okay?  She's really terrific.
SELINA: I'm sorry, Bruce.  Sometimes I get a little...aggressive, you know? (handing him a card) Look, I need to talk to you.  Come by sometime.  I'll give you the private tour.
BRUCE: Wait.  Let me explain about Vicki --
SELINA: I understand.  Anyone who's that protective must have a pretty good reason for it.
VICKI: How's "business"?
BRUCE: Relax, okay?  I like you better.
VICKI: If you're looking for your fellow millionaires, they left some time back.
PROVOST: Don't worry about that.  I've had the office swept for bugs.  No one's listening...
TIPTREE: It's just so -- unfair.  I mean...it was over a century ago.  It's not like we're responsible. (hollow-eyed) How could he know?  How could Batman know about the Raven Society??
PROVOST: Who knows and who cares.  The point is, it's happened... PROVOST (cont.) I'm clearing out of the country, and I'm taking the raven with me.  I suggest you do the same.
PROVOST (O.S.): I'll tell you how to reach me.  And don't repeat this to anyone.
SELINA: He's just another rich idiot. (chuckling to herself) The odd thing is, he didn't seem a bit concerned.
PENGUIN: Then he is
SELINA: He lives in some big sprawling manor. I'll have to get inside, scope it out... see where he's got the raven stashed.
PENGUIN: How do you plan to do that?
SELINA: How do you think!
FRICK: It's Mr. Provost, sir.  He's planning to embark on an unscheduled Christmas vacation.
PENGUIN: Good!  That should save us a trip to the bank.
BRUCE: What have we got here?
SELINA: Mummified cats.  Bastet's sacred animal. They were buried by the thousands at Bubastis.  -- Oh, careful! SELINA (cont.) Canopic jars.  In the process of mummification, the internal organs were buried separately. (pointing to each jar in turn) Lungs -- stomach -- liver -- intestine --
BRUCE: You're in a gruesome line of work.
SELINA: Keeps me interested.  And that's not easy to do...
BRUCE: This one I know.  It's a gryphon, right?
SELINA: Very good.  A mythical demon, half-bird, half-lion...sweeping down from the sky to deliver retribution and justice.
BRUCE: Poor guy.  Birds and cats -- you wouldn't think the two halves would cooperate.
SELINA: Only under certain circumstances. (beat) I'm really glad you came, Bruce.  I was afraid I'd given you the wrong impression. Or maybe it was the right impression.
BRUCE: What was it you wanted to talk to me about?
SELINA: Your mean, everyone says you've got a fabulous -- SELINA (cont.) Mainly I just wanted an excuse to see you again.  Does she know you're here -- Vicki?
BRUCE: No.
SELINA: It must be strange.  Having all that power, and money -- never really knowing if that's what people are attracted to.
BRUCE: What are you attracted to?
SELINA: I think you're a little bit nuts. (beat) I think you're a little -- bored with your life.  Having everything you want.  No variety, no...danger.  And every once in a while you need to take a risk.  Shake it all up.
BRUCE: How?
SELINA: Maybe by...coming here today. SELINA (cont.) That's one thing I can give you, Bruce -- danger -- a little something you can't get at home.
SELINA: Are you okay?
BRUCE: Is there a BRUCE (cont.) Get it away!
SELINA: Poor thing.  You're allergic!
BRUCE: Yeah, cats...ever since I was a kid... (snorting and weeping) Look, I'd better get some fresh air. Maybe another time, okay...
PROVOST: Open this in an hour.  Phone my wife and tell her where to meet me. (to the GUARDS; edgily) No trouble on the way, I take it?
LEAD GUARD: No sir, Mr. Provost.  We came straight from the bank vault.
GUARD II: 'Copter should be just touching down. We'll have you safely out of here in no time.
GUARD II: We'll check the stairs.  See you on the roof.
PROVOST: No -- my private elevator.  It's safer.
GUARD: No way.  They don't pay us enough to tangle with Batm--
PROVOST: What is it??  What's happening??
GUARD: generator's kicked in.  It's just an electrical problem.
GUARD: There.  See?  It's moving.  We're
PROVOST: It's going down.
GUARD: Okay, Mr. Provost -- I'm gonna have a look through the trap door.  But I need you to help me.  Okay?  You have to help.
GUARD: Probably just some bird that's gotten in the shaft.  Now calm down.  You'll have to give me a boost. GUARD (cont.) Okay, help me out...steady...
PENGUIN: Mr. Provost?  If you want to get out of that car alive, I suggest you follow my instructions to the letter. PENGUIN (cont.)
SHUT UP IN THERE.: You should see a cord hanging just behind you.
PROVOST: Yes -- yes, I see it -- PENGUIN (V.O; filter) Tie the cord to the handle of your box. PENGUIN (V.O.; filter) When you're done, I want you to give two sharp yanks on the cord.
PROVOST: Who are you??  Why are you
PENGUIN: Well, Mr. Provost, I guess you could call me an irate reader.  And to be perfectly frank -- I'm doing this because I hate Garfield.
PENGUIN: Going down!
CROWD: Ten!  Nine!...
CROWD: ...Three!  Two!  One!
NEWS VENDOR: Hey!  No!  I aleady got a --
CATWOMAN (O.S.): Some people just can't take discipline. (beat) Go ahead.  Finish 'em off...
CATWOMAN (O.S.): You might as well.  You're going to get blamed for it anyway.
CATWOMAN (O.S.): Oh, come on, angel.  You know you want to. (purring loudly) Besides -- I want to see how you do it!
BATMAN: Who are you?
CATWOMAN: My, aren't we frisky tonight.
CATWOMAN: I should tell you -- I've got nine lives to play with -- and you've only got one...
CATWOMAN: Did I tell you I invited company?  -- Keep 'em busy, angel, I've gotta scat.
PENGUIN: Look at that, boys -- they together!!
CATWOMAN: Ooh.  Where have you
CATWOMAN (O.S.): Nevermore.  Nevermore!
CATWOMAN: Cute, huh!  I think it'll look nice over the fireplace.  Maybe you can drop by and see it sometime. (demurely) I hope you won't think I'm too... aggressive or anything, but I find you very attractive. CATWOMAN (cont.) It's just so hard to meet interesting men these days.  Don't you think so? (sighing) I have trouble with relationships.  Men find me intimidating...kind of predatory, you know?  Really I'm not.  Really I'm just playful... CATWOMAN (cont.) Don't laugh!  I'm trying to open up to you! CATWOMAN (cont.) I always seem to fall for the wrong guys. You know...most men are rats.
CATWOMAN: you to walk all over them and then they whine when you do it.  Once you've had your fun there's not much you can do but kill them. (beat) But you seem different.  I mean, you obviously understand about dressing up... that saves a lot of explaining.  I think people should indulge their fantasies, don't you?
CATWOMAN: So I think I'll let you live.  Cute boys like you are hard to find... (standing up) 'Bye, angel.  I'll be thinking about you.
CATWOMAN: Gee...I'm
DRIVER: What the hell is
TRAFFIC COP: Awright, what's the problem here? (spotting BATMAN) Jesus.
PATROLMAN: Good God.  Cowan -- get to the car -- radio the commissioner!!
TRAFFIC COP: Is he dead?  What do we
PATROLMAN: The mask.  Get the mask off.
TRAFFIC COP: Some kinda seam here on the neck...
TRAFFIC COP: DON'T SHOOT, you idiot.  The
BULLOCK: Hell of a mess up here, Commissioner. We'll have to go in on foot...
RED BERET I: This is wack, man.  Nothing ever happens around here anymore.
DICK: It's MINE!
COP: Dumb son of a bitch!!
ALFRED: Commissioner Gordon called.  He wants to install a full contingent of police guards here at the manor -- in round-the-clock shifts -- to protect you from Batman.
BRUCE: Great.  What'd you tell him?
ALFRED: I told him that since you you'd require no protection from Batman.
ALFRED: In future, sir...I strongly advise against trying to fly off twenty-story buildings.
BRUCE: It's just a few bruises.
ALFRED: body.
BRUCE: I'm getting too old for this line of work. (beat) Cops placed me at the scene of the crime -- that weird kid of Vicki's saw my face --
ALFRED: I shouldn't worry overmuch.  I doubt the two of you move in the same circles.
BRUCE: -- and I got the living shit knocked out of me by a woman.
ALFRED: Sir -- such outmoded sexist attitudes are quite unbecoming.
PLAINCLOTHESMAN: Mailman's coming.
GORDON: Anything suspicious!
COP: Nothing yet.  Christmas cards and bills.
BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERT (V.O.): Commissioner -- ?
BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERT: It's a fruitcake.
GORDON: ...Have it analyzed.
POLICEMAN: Mrs. Tiptree?  The car's here.
LITTLE GIRL: I don't wanna go to Grandma's.  I wanna stay here with Daddy.
MRS. TIPTREE: She's got a nice tree just like ours, honey.  Daddy'll be up as soon as he can.
LITTLE GIRL: She's old.  She doesn't even have cable.
LITTLE BOY: What about our presents?
TIPTREE: Don't worry.  I'll bring 'em up with me. We'll open 'em when I get there.
GORDON: Sorry, folks, but we'd better move along.
MRS. TIPTREE: Kids?  Tell your Daddy goodbye...
TIPTREE: They'll be safe, won't they?
GORDON: As safe as we can make 'em. (beat; sternly) It would help if you could give us some small hint what this is all about.
TIPTREE: I told you.  I...
GORDON: You have no idea what was in that box that Provost had delivered from the bank. GORDON (cont.) All right, Mr. Tiptree.  Merry Christmas.
TIPTREE: Hello...?
VOICE ON LOUDSPEAKER: Mr. Tiptree?  Andy here.  Listen -- we've got a chance to grab a good-sized block of Atlantic Teledyne at twenty-six and an eighth --
TIPTREE: Not today, Andy.  Let's talk after New Year's.
SELINA: English accents are (beat) You have the most beautiful silver hair! SELINA (cont.) Bruce!
BRUCE: Selina.  What are
SELINA: I wanted to see your things, remember? And I got tired of waiting for you to call me back. (gesturing toward ALFRED) He's adorable.  How long have you had him?
BRUCE: You heard about Harry Provost.
SELINA: It's incredibly awful.  It got me a little worried. (sidling up closer) I hate to think of something happening to you.
BRUCE: Same here.
SELINA: It's odd, though.  Danger, the thought of suddenly dying -- in a weird way it gets you sort of...aroused.  Don't you think?
SELINA: Bruce, this is (indicating a suit of armor) Malaysian -- ?
BRUCE: Not bad.  Sarawak warrior caste.
SELINA: It's like -- everything in here is another little piece of your mind.  I was right about you. (turning to face him) Promise, okay?  Promise you'll show me every inch of this place.
ALFRED: The police have no files whatsoever on Selina Kyle.
BRUCE: London...Cairo...Belgium...
ALFRED: What exactly are you --
BRUCE: Her credit card records. (looking up) Every major art theft in the last five years -- she's been on the scene or close to it.
ALFRED: You mean she's some sort of -- collector? A...cat burglar, or --
BRUCE: Could be.  Museum curator, authenticator -- she's got the perfect cover for it. (beat) What would she want with that stupid raven?
ALFRED: Raven, sir?
BRUCE: That's what the Catwoman took from Provost.  A little raven statuette, about so big... (shaking his head) But it couldn't have been that valuable.
ALFRED: How very odd. (long pause) I'm sure it's nothing, but --
BRUCE: What, Alfred?
ALFRED: Your father had a raven, sir.  A small statue of the very sort you describe.  It used to sit on his desk.
BRUCE: What happened to it?
ALFRED: After your father's...demise, Mr. Tiptree came to the house and asked if he could have it.  As a keepsake.  I saw no harm... (shrugging) That was thirty years ago.
BRUCE: Wait a minute.  Mr. Tiptree?
ALFRED: father.
BRUCE: What are you looking for -- Batarangs?
TIPTREE: Bruce!  Come on up. (to the COPS) I want to talk to Mr. Wayne alone.
BRUCE: I brought you a Christmas present.  Sorry about the wrapping -- the police made me open it.
TIPTREE: ...I'm afraid I don't have anything for you.
BRUCE: I think you may have something that belonged to my father.
TIPTREE: -- You know? TIPTREE (cont.) It'll all be over tomorrow.  One way or another, it'll all be over. (looking up; despondent) I've decided, Bruce.  I'm gonna give him the last two ravens.  He's already got the others.
BRUCE: What are you talking about?
TIPTREE: Batman.  I don't know how he found out, but --
BRUCE: here.
TIPTREE: Didn't you ever wonder where it came from, Bruce?  All the privilege, all the power ...all the money? (beat) The ravens are a...a kind of map, Bruce. The key to an incredibly vast fortune.
BRUCE: Whose fortune?
TIPTREE: Gotham City's.
TIPTREE: In 1880 the Gotham City Treasury was looted.  It was a fantastic operation -- perfect military precision.  The robbers made off with milllons in gold and silver bullion...
TIPTREE (V.O.): The city was going under.  Bankrupt... until five rich men stepped in to bail it out.  In exchange they took the land rights, the mineral rights, the service contracts --
BRUCE: The Five Families.
TIPTREE: Our ancestors.  They carved it up and ran it into the ground. In five years they were rich beyond imagining. (pause) We've just been following in their footsteps.  And in all this time no one's ever suspected --
BRUCE: -- that they were the ones behind the robbery?
TIPTREE (O.S.): They had five ravens made.  Five ravens which -- combined -- would reveal the location of the treasure they'd stolen. (beat) But they never touched it.  They never needed to.  It's still there to this day.
TIPTREE: The ravens, and the passed down through generations.  Father to son... (shaking his head) Your father -- died before he could tell you.
BRUCE: So they stole his piece of the puzzle.
TIPTREE: Yeah.  I've got it, Bruce, and I'm going to hand it over.  He's right, you know. We've all been feeding -- feeding on the soul of Gotham... BRUCE (cont.) I don't believe you, Elliott.  My father was a decent man -- an honorable man.  He would never have taken part in a scheme like this.
TIPTREE: It wasn't his doing, Bruce.  It was --
BRUCE: fortune was based on a crime -- a crime against the city... (violently) Reputation or not, he would've tried to --
TIPTREE: out for you?!? TIPTREE (cont.) He was a decent man.  He was an honorable man.  That's why they had him killed.
TIPTREE: They killed him...to protect their secret ...and now the bill's come due.  Now the bill's come due.
ALFRED: Thank you, yes, everything's fine.  I'll expect your next call in an hour. (hanging up; to VICKI) The police are becoming an awful nuisance.
VICKI: I feel so awful for him, Alfred.  There must be something we can do.
ALFRED: I realized long ago -- that there are places in Mr. Wayne's heart which no one will ever penetrate --  or share. (pause) He loves you, Miss Vale.  But in certain ways he will always be alone.
BRUCE (O.S.): ...Thanks for the testimonial.
BRUCE: Tiptree's planning some kind of rendezvous with 'Batman.'  I think Batman ought to be there when it happens.
ALFRED: I see, sir.  When shall we expect you back?
BRUCE: Get your cap.  You're driving.
STAKEOUT COP I: Shit -- that's Tiptree!!
COP: Mr. Tiptree!  What the hell are you --
COP: We've gotta get back to the radio.
BRUCE: According to this, he's directly
ALFRED: The subway, sir?
BRUCE: Yeah.  Take a right.
BRUCE: He's slowed down.  Looks like he's under the park.
ALFRED: How do you propose to get down there, sir? We can't have Batman strolling up to buy a token.
BRUCE: I know another way in. (beat) Step on it.  They're down there waiting for him.
TIPTREE: I've cooperated.  I've done everything you said.
PENGUIN: Open the case. PENGUIN (cont.) ...Two ravens?
TIPTREE: The other one is Bruce Wayne's. (trembling) He doesn't know anything about this. You've got what you want.  There's no need to --
TIPTREE: My family.  You won't --
PENGUIN: We'll certainly take your unexpected generosity into consideration.
TIPTREE: (shielding his eyes) You're not Batman.
PENGUIN: No.  I'm his brother-in-law -- Birdman. Now move out.
CATWOMAN: That
PENGUIN: So sorry to spoil your two ravens.  We've got a complete set!
CATWOMAN: What??
PENGUIN: Yeah!  They're in the suitcase --
PENGUIN: Haven't you got anything else to think about? (mopping sweat from his brow) I'm hot.  That was exhausting.
CATWOMAN: No pain, no gain!  -- Suck it up.  We're not out of here yet.
PENGUIN: Now.  Give each raven a quarter-turn.
CATWOMAN: What happens now?
PENGUIN: I don't know.  That's all...! PENGUIN (cont.) We've been TRICKED!  It's a HOAX!  It's a --
CATWOMAN: No.  It's a
PENGUIN: about the treasure, eh...? (handing her the map) Look at this.  It's right under Wayne Manor.  It's been there all along! PENGUIN (cont.) Looks like some kind of cave.
VICKI: No, no -- don't try to get up -- you're hurt. VICKI (cont.) It's all right.  You're safe.  You can stay here as long as you need to.
DICK: I don't belong here.  You can't keep me here.
VICKI: It's "Dick", isn't it?  Or do you prefer "Richard"?
VICKI: "R" -- for Richard, right?  See, all your things are here... (staring at the costume) What is it, some kind of gymnast's outfit?
DICK: It's none of your business.  What is this, some kind of home?
VICKI: No, not pool -- tennis court -- you can have anything you want.
DICK: Tennis court?!  -- Lady, you're rich.  How the hell would you know what I want?
DICK: I'm not staying.  You can't
BRUCE: I can make you. BRUCE (cont.) Come on.  Wanna go at it? (no response) Look, kid -- like it or not, you're my guest -- and long as you're here you might as well enjoy it. BRUCE (cont.) Will you two be okay in here?
ALFRED: What do you propose to do with him, sir? Keep him in the room for the rest of his life?
BRUCE: I don't know, Alfred.  I've got other stuff to worry about.
ALFRED: The child is hurt, sir.  At the very least we should attempt to locate his parents.
BRUCE: He hasn't got any parents.
ALFRED: How do you know that, sir?
BRUCE: ...I know.
ALFRED: Sir -- it's Miss Kyle.
SELINA: Well!  Tall, dark and handsome.  Are we still on for tonight?
ALFRED: Is this necessary, sir?  After all...it Christmas eve.
BRUCE: Stuff'll knock out a moose, much less a cat.
ALFRED: I don't like to see you going out on a date...unprotected, sir.
BRUCE: She'll be ready for Batman -- but not for me. (turning to go) It's the only way, Alfred.  I've got to take her out tonight.
SELINA: You're early.  I'm afraid I'm not quite dressed. SELINA (cont.) If you're looking for my bondage gear, it's at the cleaners.
BRUCE: Christmas eve.  No tree?
SELINA: No presents.  I've been a bad girl this year.
BRUCE: I'm surprised you kept this date.  I thought you would've lost interest by now.
SELINA: What makes you say that?
BRUCE: You've got what you want, don't you?
SELINA: I do (smiling) We've had this date for a long, long time.
BRUCE: How much is it going to cost me?
SELINA: What?
BRUCE: ...To get the ravens back.
SELINA: You're the oddest man I've ever met. (moving in on him) Let's talk later, Bruce.  I've got kind of a short fuse...
SELINA: Did I hurt you?  Just relax -- you'll start to enjoy it. SELINA (cont.) Bruce, you look faint.  It must be the cats.
BRUCE: What di-- what did you d--
SELINA: I guess I've...gotten under your skin.
ALFRED: Everything's fine, thank you.  We'll talk in an hour.
PENGUIN: Try his mag card.
FRICK: Look at this.  He's a pillhead.
VICKI: Ohh.  Am I glad to --
VICKI: What did you
SELINA: First-time jitters, I guess.  Everything was going great, and then...he just went limp as a noodle.
PENGUIN: You'd be the butler.  Why don't you come on down and attend to your guests?
ALFRED: Mr. Wayne.  Is he -- ?
PENGUIN: You know how it is.  Some guys just can't hold their egg nog.
PENGUIN: I should explain the occasion of our visit.  There's a treasure underneath this house -- and I don't plan to leave until you tell me how to find it.  Now who's going to talk -- Miss Vale?
VICKI: I don't know what you're talking about.
PENGUIN: The there? VICKI (cont.) I don't know!  I swear, I would tell you --
PENGUIN: Then maybe you'd like to tell me.
ALFRED: You're no more than a common thief.
PENGUIN: Wrong, you old idiot.  I happen to be a very uncommon thief. (beat) Are you going to tell me, or does Miss Vale get an early present this year?
ALFRED: I...don't...know...
PENGUIN: Then go ahead, Mr. Frick... tree.
SELINA: Wait! (crossing over to VICKI) We don't know how to get down there yet. We may need her when Bruce wakes up. SELINA (cont.) Besides -- I want this one for myself.  So pretty...I'm going to give her a brand new face for Christmas.
PENGUIN: Why don't you two tie up our host?
PENGUIN: It's all so plush and tasteful, isn't it? Just the sort of setting in which I've always imagined myself. PENGUIN (cont.) I see.  You think I'm vulgar.  You think I'm...nouveau.
ALFRED: I think you're a dirty little man with a --
PENGUIN: See, boys, that's old money talking. After a while, they actually start to believe they've earned all this. (smirking) I don't mind.  Someday I'll be old money too -- when the statute of limitations runs out.
SELINA (O.S.): Hey!  -- Guess what I just found. SELINA (cont.) Christmas cookies!
PENGUIN: Let's spread out and see what we can find. (to FRICK and FRACK) You two -- keep an eye on our friends here.  Give me a yell the minute Wayne comes to.
FRICK: Better check it out. FRICK (cont.) What is it?  What's going on??
FRACK: Some kind of security system --
DICK: Can you
BRUCE: Library -- got to get me to the library --
PENGUIN: What is that ungodly racket?
FRACK: A security alarm.  It went off in the kitchen.
PENGUIN: My God!  Is someone
BRUCE: Alfred...
DICK: I'll go back.
BRUCE: I can't...get down there...without you.
PENGUIN: What an extraordinarily stupid thing to do.
VICKI: SHUT UP.  Help me with him.
PENGUIN: You and I had better check the ground floor and see what's going on.  Mr. Frick -- do you think you'll be able to manage this pair?
FRICK: Yes sir.
PENGUIN: Oh, good.  That PENGUIN (cont.) Where's Wayne???
PENGUIN: Check the grounds!  The shape he's in, he can't have gotten far.
BRUCE: -- as soon as he gets to the East wing. Wait for my signal.  You know what to do. BRUCE (O.S.; filter)
DICK: Here.  You might need it.
ALFRED: Thank you, Master Dick.  And...
VOICE FROM BEHIND: Do you really think we're SELINA (cont.) I tawt I taw a puddy tat...!!
SELINA: You know, I've got a great recipe for Sliced Bitch --
SELINA: I love a good old-fashioned catfight -- but this is pissing me off.
SELINA: HERE, kitty kitty kitty...HERE, kitty kitty...
SELINA: So this is where you earn your keep.
SELINA: Mmm!  Frederick's of Gotham?
SELINA: Not so loud, honey!  The neighbors'll get the wrong idea. (laughing) Santa's coming.  Time for all good girls to go to sleep...
BATMAN: Miss me, "Angel"?
SELINA: Okay -- let's do it, huh?  You and me... all the way this time.
VICKI: Come on.  We'll be safe in the cave.
VICKI: Come on.  Come with us.
DICK: No.  I can still help...
PENGUIN: Such primitive entertainment. PENGUIN (cont.) So Bruce equals Batman.  It seems I've discovered two treasures! (an evil smile) Don't move.  I'd be only too happy to shoot you both.
PENGUIN: The Gotham City Treasury.  It's about to be stolen twice.
ALFRED: Don't be absurd. You'll never be able to get it out of here.
PENGUIN: Oh, I'll manage somehow.  You two are my guarantee of that. (nudging VICKI with the gun) Let's have a look, shall we?  You go first.
SELINA: It could've been so nice -- you and me -- if only you weren't so screwed up.
BATMAN: It's over.  I don't want to hurt you any more.
SELINA: Tell me something -- one thing.  If you don't enjoy all this...why do you do it? SELINA (cont.) I'll never understand men.
BATMAN: Nine lives.
CATWOMAN: I can't move.  I can't move. CATWOMAN (cont.)
DON'T LOOK AT ME!!: Do me, baby...do me now...that's what I want.  Please?
BATMAN: No.
CATWOMAN: COME ON.  Don't stop now.  FINISH ME OFF. (almost weeping with pain) Son of a bitch.  You're all alike...
DICK: You should've done it, man.  You should've killed her.
BATMAN: There's a radio in the cave.  We'll send for help.
PENGUIN: Ah, the illustrious Mr. Wayne.  Look at you now.  Whatever would your friends say? (smiling) You've been an exceptionally congenial host -- but I must ask you to back off.
PENGUIN: No sudden moves.  It's a long way down.
GORDON: ...and then Batman showed up?
BRUCE: He saved all our lives, Jim.  I can't say for sure, but I'd bet she's the one behind the murders.
GORDON: God -- I pray you're right. (beat) One thing before we go, Bruce.  Who's the kid?
BRUCE: Oh, that's Vicki's little cousin.  He's in town for the holidays.
GORDON: Well, he picked a hell of a time to visit. (turning to go) Merry Christmas, Bruce.  Good luck cleaning this place up.
VICKI: What are you going to do with all that gold?
BRUCE: I dunno.  Might be a good start on a place to live -- for some people who don't have one.
VICKI: It's Christmas.
BRUCE: Yeah.  Maybe you should -- open your present.
VICKI: Oh, Bruce, presents doesn't matter.  None of it matters.  We're all safe.  We're together.
BRUCE: ...You might as well.
