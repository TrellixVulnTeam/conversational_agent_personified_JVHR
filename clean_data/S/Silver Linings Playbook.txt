SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK: Written by David O. Russell (Based on the novel by Matthew Quick)
PAT: What, are you kidding me? Sundays? I love Sundays. I live for Sundays. The whole family's together. Mom makes braciole. Dad puts the jersey on. We're all watching the game. Yeah, it drives me crazy, and yes, I was negative.
PAT (CONT'D): You didn't even know that I loved it, Nikki, but I did. I just didn't appreciate it, or you, before." There is a knock at the door.
PAT: I lost all that. I blew it. But you also blew it. We can get it back. We're gonna get it back. It's all gonna be better now. I'm better now and I hope you are, too. And I'm
GONNA APPRECIATE--": Another knock at the door. Pat ignores it.
PAT (CONT'D): Hey, I'll be there in a minute, okay?
PAT: I'll be there in a minute. Pat returns to his speech.
PAT (CONT'D): That's true love. See glimpses of Pat's room: mayonnaise jar filled with water, black trash bag strewn on the bed, handwritten sign taped to Pat's wall, "EXCELSIOR".
DANNY: Yeah, that's when I had long hair. People say I talk about my hair too much.
DANNY (CONT'D): And it was just the way I wanted it, but he cut it back too far. He cut this side back too far trying to even it up. I didn't tell him to do that. I said, "Just cut it the way you cut it...."
PAT: Once you get in the right frame of mind, I think anything's possible. I think we get, we so often get caught in this state of negativity and it's a, it's a poison like nothing else.
DOLORES: I don't want him to get used to the routine here. Eight months is already long enough.
PAT: Hey, Mom. Can we give Danny a ride to North Philly?
DOLORES: What? I don't understand.
PAT: Mom, no, it'll be fine. It'll be fine.
DANNY: I guess everybody's leaving today! Hello, Mrs. S. An honor to finally meet you. Pat told me all about you, how God made you rich in character, and you're the mighty oak that holds the household together, and not to mention the lasagna you make on game day when the Birds play.
PAT: Danny was in for assault because of crystal meth and alcohol.
DANNY: Bad combination.
PAT: Yeah. On top of an anxiety disorder.
DANNY: That was when I was an X-ray technician with my ADD and my anxiety. I had a lot of access to medication and I took advantage of it. That's when my hair was long, too. But my hair only grew when I was older. When I was younger, my hair didn't grow because my brother...
(TO PAT): Remember I told you about my brother, he had a Jheri curl, and I couldn't get a Jheri curl because my hair didn't grow long enough. I was so jealous of my brother...
(TO DOLORES): He's obsessed with his hair.
DOLORES: (into cell phone) Hello?
(TO DANNY): It looks great now.
DANNY: You like it?
PAT: It's good now.
DOLORES: (into cell phone) Yes, it is.
DANNY: (as Pat touches hair) Wait, you're going the wrong way!
DOLORES: (into cell phone) What? Are you sure about that? I'll bring him back right away.
DOLORES (CONT'D): You lied to me, Pat. Danny's not allowed to leave.
PAT: All right, Mom, just hold on a sec.
(VOICE OVER): Let's just talk about this.
PAT: Mom, just listen--
DOLORES: Don't tou-...
DOLORES: ...-ch the steering...
(VOICE OVER): ...wheel!
DOLORES: Pat, this whole thing was a mistake.
PAT: I'm sorry, Mom. You okay?
DOLORES: I am out on a limb for you with the courts right now.
DANNY: It's my fault. Pat didn't know. Pat didn't know. He's my friend, so he was rootin' for me.
DANNY (CONT'D): I'm havin' a disagreement with the hospital, but we're working it out. Take me back to the hospital, but take Pat home, he's fine. Trust me. You'll see, he's fine. It's my fault.
PAT: Mom, can we stop at the library? I wanna read Nikki's entire English high school syllabus.
PAT (CONT'D): Mom, it's a good thing. I'm remaking myself.
RANDY: Come on, tell me that one.
RANDY: You know something? It's nothing new. Your team does that all the time. They get close...
RANDY (CONT'D): ...and then they blow it. They got an inferiority complex.
RANDY: Because we are, we're America's Team.
RANDY: What's more American than a cowboy?
RANDY: What?
RANDY: Benjamin Franklin?
RANDY: You mean the guy with the...
RANDY: ...little glasses and the long scraggly hair?
RANDY: If he wasn't on the hundred dollar bill, nobody...
RANDY (CONT'D): ...would even know who he is.
RANDY: I didn't even touch `em. Why are you--, don't blame me.
RANDY: No, I don't touch them. As a matter of fact, I don't know why you need so many. Hey, there she is! Look how beautiful!
RANDY: Hey.
PAT: (awkward, unsure) Mm-hmm.
PAT: It's right here.
PAT: You still got yours?
DOLORES: Well, he's ready. Look at him.
PAT: You didn't tell Dad you were picking me up?
DOLORES: Don't worry about that.
DOLORES: The court said yes. Don't worry.
PAT: Yeah, and the court said--
PAT: Dad, relax. The court said it's fine, okay? Let it go.
DOLORES: Don't worry.
PAT: Dad, I'm in there because of the court. That's the agreement that we made months ago. It was a plea bargain with the courts. The lawyer, he instructed me, he said that what we should plead that, and then I would serve eight months and then I'd get out.
DOLORES: It's all under control.
PAT: Thank you. So what are you doing with yourself?
PAT: How you gonna pay for it?
PAT: From your bookmaking?
PAT: Mom told me. Outside.
DOLORES: I did not. No, I didn't.
PAT: You just told me outside, Mom, what are you talking about? Five minutes ago, we were walking up the stairs, you said, "Don't say anything, but Dad lost his job and he's bookmaking."
(TO PAT): Everything's fine, Patrick. I'm more concerned about you than anything else.
PAT: Good, Dad. Good.
PAT: What am I gonna do? I'm getting in shape, I'm getting trim, I'm getting really fit for Nikki. I'm gonna read Nikki's teaching syllabus and get my old job back.
PAT: Let me tell you something. You don't know anything about my marriage, okay, Dad? All right? Our marriage...we're very, very much in love, okay? Just like you two.
PAT: What are you doing, Dad? You know what? Excelsior. Excelsior.
PAT: It means you know what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna take all this negativity and use it as fuel and I'm gonna find a silver lining, that's what I'm gonna do. And that's no bullshit. That's no bullshit. That takes work and that's the truth.
PAT: What the fuck?!
(YELLING): Stupid fucking book!
(YELLING): I just can't believe Nikki's teaching that book to the kids. I mean the whole time -- let me just break it down for you -- the whole time you're rooting for this Hemingway guy to survive the war and to be with the woman that he loves, Catherine Barkley...
DOLORES: It's four o'clock in the morning, Pat.
PAT: ...and he does. He does. He survives the war, after getting blown up he survives it, and he escapes to Switzerland with Catherine. But now Catherine's pregnant. Isn't that wonderful? She's pregnant. And they escape up into the mountains and they're gonna be happy, and they're gonna be drinking wine and they dance -- they both like to dance with each other, there's scenes of them dancing, which was boring, but I liked it, because they were happy. You think he ends it there? No! He writes another ending. She dies, Dad! I mean, the world's hard enough as it is, guys. It's fucking hard enough as it is. Can't somebody say, "Hey, let's be positive? Let's have a good ending to the story?"
DOLORES: Pat, you owe us an apology.
PAT: Mom, for what, I can't apologize. I'm not gonna apologize for this. You know what I will do? I will apologize on behalf of Ernest Hemingway, because that's who's to blame here.
PAT: I was reading.
PAT: I'm gonna go run now.
PAT: I'll fix it when I get back.
DOLORES: Get in the car, Pat. You have to go to therapy.
PAT: I don't wanna go to therapy.
DOLORES: You have to go. It's part of the deal. You can't live with us and not go.
PAT: Is that song really playing?
RECEPTIONIST: We have music sometimes.
PAT: That song is killing me. Could you please turn it off?
RECEPTIONIST: I can't.
PAT: What do you mean, you can't?
RECEPTIONIST: I don't have the controls. I'm sorry, I--
(INTERRUPTING)): Did Doctor Timbers put you up to this? Is there a speaker here?
PAT (CONT'D): Is, is the speaker here?
PAT (CONT'D): I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay...I'm sorry. I'll fix all this, okay?
PAT: That was a messed up thing you did, Doctor Patel. That's a messed up thing. I'm sorry, but that's....
PAT: Yeah, well, Cliff, that's not the way you're supposed to meet people, okay? Why don't you write that down in your, I don't know, your little book you write stuff down in.
PAT: Bravo. It's a trigger. I'm not gonna take any meds, I should just tell you that right now.
PAT: No, I'm not gonna take any medicine. It makes me foggy--
(INTERRUPTING): No, you will have to take medication.
PAT: I don't want any meds, Doctor. Look, I am not the explosion guy, okay? My father is the explosion guy. I'm not that guy. He got kicked out of that stadium he beat up so many people at Eagles games, he's on the exclusion list. I had one incident.
PAT: But I'm ready. I'm ready to take responsibility for my side of the street. She just needs to take responsibility for hers.
PAT: What's hers? Are you joking? Let's go back to the incident. I come home from work after I
(VOICE OVER): I left work early -- which I never do, by the way, but I got in a fight with Nancy, the high school
PAT: ...principal. I come home and what's playing but the song from my wedding. The song that you so charmingly played out here today for us. That's playing and I don't think anything of it. Which is odd, `cause I should have.
(VOICE OVER): I come home, what do I see? I walk in the door and I see underwear and pieces of clothing and a guy's pants with his belt in it, and I walk up the stairs, and all...
PAT: ...ll of a sudden I see the DVD player, and on the D-...
(VOICE OVER): ...-VD player is the CD and it's playing our wedding song, and then I look down and I see my wife's...
PAT: ...panties on the ground and then-
(VOICE OVER): ...I look up and I see her naked in the shower...
PAT: ...and I think, "Oh, that's kinda sweet, she's in the shower. What a perfect thing. I'm gonna find her and maybe I'll go in there. We never-...
(VOICE OVER): ...fuck in the shower anymore. Maybe today we will." I...
PAT: ...pull the curtain back and there's the fucking history...
(VOICE OVER): ...-teacher with tenure.
PAT: And you know what he says to me?
(VOICE OVER): "You should probably go." That's what he says to me.
PAT: So yeah, I snapped. I almost beat him to death. But now I get fucking chastised for it? I'm parallel to my father? I don't think so.
PAT: Yeah, about a week before the incident, I called the cops and I told them that my wife and the history guy were plotting against me by embezzling money from the local high school, which wasn't true. It was a delusion. And we later found out from the hospital that's because I'm, uh...
PAT: Yeah. With mood swings and weird thinking brought on by severe stress, which rarely happens, thank God. And then the shower incident happened and that's when everything snapped, so I then realized that, oh, wow, I've been dealing with this my whole life. And without any supervision I've been doing it all on my own with no help and basically I've been white-knuckling it this whole time.
PAT: Yeah. It's a lot to deal with, especially when you don't know what the hell is happening, which I do now. Sort of.
PAT: I can't, Mom. I can't.
DOLORES: I will call them. They'll come for you.
PAT: Why would you do that? You wouldn't do that. Why would you call them?
PAT: I don't, I don't feel good when I'm on them, Mom. I don't feel good. I'm so much clearer without them. Mom, they make me bloated. I don't like the way it makes me look.
DOLORES: You've gotta take your medication.
PAT: Come on, I'm doing it with my physicality. I've been workin' out, that's what I'm doin'.
DOLORES: Why are you wearing a garbage bag?
PAT: To sweat.
PAT: I don't believe in juju, Dad.
PAT: All right, all right.
PAT: For a second. I'll watch the beginning of the game.
DOLORES: He says you're good...
DOLORES (CONT'D): ..luck, honey.
PAT: What's that in your hand?
PAT: Handkerchief?
PAT: That's OCD. That's crazy.
DOLORES: I'm making crabby snacks and homemades.
PAT: I'm the reason? I don't think so.
(INTO TELEPHONE): Yeah, Tommy, Tommy, yes, yes. I got your whole sheet. Yeah. No, no...
PAT: Mom.
(INTO TELEPHONE): ...I'm just confirming. I'm just confirming. Okay.
RICKY: Can I do..an interview for a school project on mental illness?
PAT: Who's that? That's not Rick D'Angelo, is it?
DOLORES: That's him.
PAT: Is he the guy who's having the problem?
DOLORES: Yeah, that's the one.
PAT: No, you shut the door in his face. I'm going for a run.
DOLORES: Pat, don't look for Nikki!
DOLORES: Pat!
DOLORES: Don't look for Nikki!
PAT: Ms. Meckers!
NANCY: Oh, God! Oh, God! NANCY HURRIES to avoid him.
PAT: Nance! This is my lucky day! Look at you working on a Sunday!
PAT (CONT'D): How are you? Hey.
NANCY: What are you doing here?
PAT: I just came by to say hi, to let you know I'm ready to come back to work.
NANCY: You shouldn't be here.
PAT: I'll work full-time, half-time. I'll sub, I'll work history, whatever you want.
PAT (CONT'D): Here, let me give you a hand. I'm sorry. I'm being rude.
NANCY: I got it.
NANCY (CONT'D): I got it. I got it.
PAT: Let me ask you something. Let me just ask you something. Does Nikki still work here?
NANCY: You know I can't tell you that. But Doug Culpepper is still here.
PAT: Why would you tell me that? You know he broke up my marriage. What, are you being, a troublemaker?
NANCY: You know, you look good. Did you lose a lot of weight?
PAT: I did, yeah. I did. Thank you.
NANCY: Get away from me! Get away!
PAT: I'm better. I just want to let you know, I'm better now. Okay? I'm better. I feel good. I feel so good. Look at my eyes. Look at my eyes. Look at how clear they are.
PAT: I'm not a complainer anymore. I'm a positive guy. Okay?
NANCY: You just have to give it some time.
PAT: Yes.
NANCY: You know, a lot went down. People will get over it. It'll be all good. It'll work out.
PAT: Yes! It will be!
PAT (CONT'D): I'm gonna take that as a silver development, Nancy! A silver development! That's a silver lining!
NANCY: Good luck.
PAT: Ronnie! Pat.
(LAUGHS): There he is! He's back!
PAT: Hey.
RONNIE: Welcome home.
PAT: Thank you.
RONNIE: Welcome back, man.
PAT: Yeah, I'm out.
RONNIE: Yeah? You're out out?
PAT: Uh-huh.
RONNIE: Cool, man. Wow, you lost a lot of weight. I almost didn't recognize you.
PAT: Thank you.
RONNIE: I'm sorry I didn't visit you in the hospital. You know, work's out of control, you know, she had the baby. I'm really glad you're back. I missed you. I really need someone to talk to. You gotta come see the baby. She's beautiful. And Veronica wants to make dinner for you.
PAT: Congratulations on the baby, but I'm not buying the invitation.
RONNIE: 'Cause you think Veronica still hates you?
PAT: I know Veronica still hates me.
RONNIE: That's not true.
PAT: Yes, it is. Nikki always said that "Ronnie's wife keeps his social calendar where she keeps his balls, in her purse."
RONNIE: That's not true.
VERONICA: Ronnie! What are you doing?
RONNIE: Okay, it's a little true. But if you think she still hates you, you're wrong because why would she tell me to invite you to dinner? Hmm?
VERONICA: Did you invite him?
RONNIE: Yes.
VERONICA: Well, can he make it?
RONNIE: I don't know yet! (to Pat) Can you make it next Sunday?
PAT: Sure.
RONNIE: I'll see you next Sunday.
PAT: Now, you guys are still in touch with Nikki, right? Does Veronica still talk to Nikki?
RONNIE: Yeah.
VERONICA: Get in here, please. I need you.
RONNIE: Okay.
PAT: I have very, good news, everybody. Very good news.
PAT: Things are looking up.
PAT: You know what, I knew why they invited me over. I knew it.
PAT: Oh, no way!
PAT: No way, Dad. You mean, Doug Culpepper?
PAT: Wait just a minute.
PAT: What are you doing?
PAT: Give me the phone. Dad, this is my life. Dad.
DOLORES: Pat!
(TEARFULLY): Don't talk to me like that.
(VOICE OVER): I got...a call asking to...
OFFICER KEOGH: ...check on this house. Pat Solatano?
PAT: Yeah.
OFFICER KEOGH: Yeah? Missus Solatano, Mister Solatano, I'm Officer Keogh. I work this beat. Look, I heard about the restraining order. And I heard you went to your old house and the school. It's not okay. I've been assigned to your case, so you're gonna be seeing a lot of me. Do yourself a favor. Respect the restraining order, okay? Five hundred feet.
PAT: Yeah, Dad, I know.
OFFICER KEOGH: If you need anything...my card.
PAT: Since when do cops have cards?
PAT: Nikki's waiting for me to get in shape and get my life in order, and then she's gonna be with me. And that's better than any medication.
PAT: Let me say something, I gotta say something.
PAT: This is what I believe to be true. This is what I learned in the hospital. You have to do everything you can, you have to work your hardest, and if you do, if you stay positive, you have a shot at a silver lining.
PAT: Hey, my friend Ronnie's having this party on Sunday night and it's like a real hoity-toity thing and his wife, Veronica's a real stickler for.... I don't know, my mom got this Gap outfit she wants me to wear, but I wanna wear a jersey that my brother, Jake, got me from the Eagles.
PAT: DeSean Jackson.
PAT: Well, that settles that.
RONNIE: Pat! What are you doin'?
PAT: I gotta go, man.
RONNIE: Why?
PAT: I can't stay, come on. I made a mistake, I shouldn't have worn this.
RONNIE: Dude, you're fine. I like that jersey. I wish I was wearing that jersey.
PAT: I feel like an idiot.
RONNIE: Are you comfortable?
PAT: Veronica's not gonna like it.
RONNIE: Get over here.
PAT: Plus you got a tie on.
RONNIE: Don't worry about it, you're the guest of honor. You come however you wanna come.
PAT: Really?
RONNIE: Get over here.
RONNIE: DeSean Jackson's in the house!
VERONICA: You mean rookie of the year?
RONNIE: Yeah.
(TO BABY): DeSean Jackson? DeSean Jackson? (noticing Pat) Oh, you wore a jersey to dinner.
RONNIE: Isn't it awesome?
VERONICA: Not for dinner.
RONNIE: Look, he got us flowers.
VERONICA: Oh, that's sweet. (to Pat) That's sweet, Pat. That's lovely.
RONNIE: And wine.
PAT: Hey.
VERONICA: Hey.
RONNIE: Check this out. We just redid the whole thing.
PAT: Wow!
PAT (CONT'D): Tremendous. Tremendous.
RONNIE: Isn't it great?
PAT: Tremendous.
RONNIE: Yeah, man, I'm, I'm thinking of redoing it again.
PAT: Why?
RONNIE: Because.
PAT: Gotta be making a lot of paper to do that.
RONNIE: Yeah, we're doing all right, man. I can't complain.
PAT: Isn't the market down, though?
RONNIE: It is down, but you know, she wants more, so I'm giving her more, man.
PAT: Hey, you know my dad lost his pension.
RONNIE: I'm sorry, man.
PAT: Yeah.
RONNIE: A lot of people. My uncle, too.
PAT: Really?
RONNIE: Yeah, but you know what? No disrespect, it's not personal, but this is the time to strike.
RONNIE (CONT'D): You start snapping up commercial real estate -- cheap -- flip it over, you flip it over and that's when you make the money. But the pressure...it's like....
PAT: You okay?
(WHISPERING): I'm not okay. Don't tell anybody. Listen to me. I feel like I'm getting crushed and--
(WHISPERING): Crushed by what?
(WHISPERING): Everything. The family, the baby, the job, the fucking dicks at work, and it's like, you know, like I'm trying to do this, (Ronnie reaches for his throat, mimicking trying to breath) you know, and, and, and I'm like...suffocating.
PAT: Holy shit.
RONNIE: You can't be happy all the time.
PAT: Who told you you can't be happy?
RONNIE: It's all right. You just do your best, you have no choice.
PAT: That's not true at all.
RONNIE: You just can't.
PAT: Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie!
RONNIE: I hope you're okay with Veronica's sister coming over. You okay with that?
PAT: Who?
RONNIE: Veronica's sister.
(IN UNISON): Tiffany.
PAT: Tiffany and...Tommy?
RONNIE: Yeah. Just Tiffany.
PAT: What happened to Tommy?
RONNIE: He died.
PAT: Tommy died?
RONNIE: Cops die.
PAT: How'd he die?
RONNIE: Please, don't bring it up.
PAT: No, how did he die?
TIFFANY: How did who die?
RONNIE: Hey, Tiffany! This is Pat. Pat, my sister-in-law Tiffany.
PAT: You look nice.
TIFFANY: Thank you.
PAT: I'm not flirting with you.
TIFFANY: Oh, I didn't think you were.
PAT: I just see that you made an effort and I'm gonna be better with my wife, I'm working on that. I wanna acknowledge her beauty. I never used to do that. I do that now. `Cause we're gonna be better than ever...Nikki. Just practicing. How'd Tommy die?
PAT (CONT'D): What about your job?
TIFFANY: I just got fired, actually.
PAT: Oh, really? How?
PAT (CONT'D): I mean, I'm sorry. How'd that happen?
TIFFANY: Does it really matter?
VERONICA: Baby, how's it going?
RONNIE: Great, great.
VERONICA: Everyone having fun? We're gonna go on a tour now. We're gonna go on a tour now.
(TO PAT): Let's go see the house.
RONNIE: Come on, let's go for the tour.
RONNIE: (motions to Pat) Come on.
VERONICA: Guess what it is.
PAT: Oh, it's a television.
TIFFANY: It's a computer screen.
RONNIE: Nope.
VERONICA: Just keep going, keep going, keep going.
PAT: It's a brick oven, it's a brick oven.
TIFFANY: It's a light. It's a...
VERONICA: Ooh, ooh, warmer, warmer, warmer.
TIFFANY: ...it's a drawer at a morgue where they pull out dead bodies and shoot them with formaldehyde.
VERONICA: Don't think so hard, don't think so hard.
PAT: Where would the dead body...where would the body go, though? `Cause the outside of the--
(ANNOYED): It's a joke!
VERONICA: It's a...fireplace.
TIFFANY: In the middle of the wall?
VERONICA: We have a port in every room. Gimme an iPod. Who, who doesn't have an iPod?
PAT: Well, I don't have an iPod. I don't even have a phone. They won't let me make any calls. They think I'm gonna call Nikki.
RONNIE: Don't worry about it. Don't focus on that.
PAT: I would call Nikki.
RONNIE: I'm actually gonna give you one of my iPods. I have an old one.
VERONICA: Gimme your iPod.
VERONICA (CONT'D): Give it to me. Thank you, baby, thank you.
TIFFANY: Of all the rooms there are iPod ports in, I'm happy you brought us into the bathroom.
VERONICA: Look, look, look.
VERONICA (CONT'D): I can play music for the baby in any room.
PAT: Can you play "Ride the Lightning" by Metallica?
RONNIE: Pat was a history sub at the high school, Tiffany. Ask him about any president, he knows 'em all.
PAT: Here's a fun fact. You know where the term "OK" comes from?
VERONICA: No. No, I don't.
RONNIE: Where?
PAT: Well, Martin Van Buren, the eighth president of the United States of America, is from Kinderhook, New York...
VERONICA: Oh.
PAT: ...and he was part of a club, a men's club, called Old Kinderhook. And if you were cool, you were in the club, they'd say, "That guy's OK." `Cause he was in the Old Kinderhooks.
RONNIE: Really?
PAT: Yeah. Pretty cool, right?
RONNIE: That's interesting.
VERONICA: You know, Tiffany's been doing this dance thing for years and she's real good at it. She's gonna be competing at the Ben Franklin Hotel.
PAT: Oh, really? My wife loves dance. Nikki loves dance.
TIFFANY: Why do you have to talk about me like that?
VERONICA: I'm just bragging about you. Can't I brag about my little sister?
TIFFANY: Don't talk about me in the third person.
VERONICA: Please, gimme a break.
TIFFANY: I'm right here.
VERONICA: Just be nice. Just be nice.
PAT: Wow, wow, wow. Fascinating.
TIFFANY: Sorry. I don't wanna be mean.
VERONICA: I know. I know, I know.
(TO PAT): What meds are you on?
PAT: Me? None. I used to be on Lithium and Seroquel and Abilify, but I don't take them anymore, no. They make me foggy and they also make me bloated.
TIFFANY: Yeah, I was on Xanax and Effexor, but I agree, I wasn't as sharp, so I stopped.
PAT: You ever take Klonopin?
TIFFANY: Klonopin? (Chuckling) Yeah.
PAT: Right?
TIFFANY: Jesus.
PAT: It's like, "What? What day is it?" How about Trazodone?
TIFFANY: Trazodone!
PAT: Oh, it flattens you out. I mean, you are done. It takes the light right out of your eyes.
TIFFANY: God, I bet it does.
TIFFANY (CONT'D): I'm tired. I wanna go.
VERONICA: No. No, no, no, no. We haven't, we haven't even finished the salad yet, or the duck. I made the Fire and Ice cake.
TIFFANY: I said I'm tired. (to Pat) Are you gonna walk me home or what?
PAT: You mean me?
TIFFANY: Yeah, you. Are you gonna walk me home?
PAT: You have poor social skills. You have a problem.
TIFFANY: I have a problem? You say more inappropriate things than appropriate things. You scare people.
PAT: I tell the truth. But you're mean.
TIFFANY: What? I'm not telling the truth? Veronica and Ronnie are very uncomfortable.
RONNIE: Um, maybe I should drive them home separately?
VERONICA: You can drive them both home. Now.
TIFFANY: Stop talking about me in third person.
VERONICA: You can take Tiffany home first.
TIFFANY: You love it when I have problems. You love it, Von, because then you can be the good one. Just say it.
VERONICA: No...
VERONICA (CONT'D): ...I don't. I don't. I just wanted to have a nice, I just wanted to have a nice dinner.
TIFFANY: Oh, God.
VERONICA: What is your problem?!
TIFFANY: Nothing's my problem! I'm fine. I'm tired and I wanna go. (to Pat) Come on, are you ready? Pat stands.
VERONICA: You really, you really wanna go right now?
TIFFANY: Yes, I really wanna go! It's been great.
RONNIE: Okay, guys, the baby is sleeping!
TIFFANY: Sorry. I don't wanna wake up the baby. Bye.
RONNIE: Sorry, man.
TIFFANY: This is me.
TIFFANY (CONT'D): Listen, I haven't dated since before my marriage so I don't really remember how this works.
PAT: How what works?
TIFFANY: I saw the way you were looking at me, Pat. You felt it, I felt it, don't lie. We're not liars like they are. I live in the addition around back, which is completely separate from my parents' house, so there's no chance of them walking in on us. I hate the fact that you wore a football jersey to dinner because I hate football, but you can fuck me if you turn the lights off, okay?
PAT: How old are you?
TIFFANY: Old enough to have a marriage end and not wind up in a mental hospital.
PAT: Look, I had a really good time tonight and I think you're really pretty, but I'm married, okay?
TIFFANY: You're married? So am I.
PAT: No, that's confusing. He's dead.
PAT (CONT'D): Wait, what?
PAT (CONT'D): What's happening?
PAT (CONT'D): Oh, my God. Hey.
DOLORES: Are you okay? Ronnie called. Hey, is that make-up on your shirt?
PAT: I don't know, Mom.
PAT: When am I gonna get a phone?
DOLORES: Pat!
(WHISPERING): Mom!
(WHISPERING): I can't find my wedding video. Mom, wake up.
(WHISPERING): What is it?
(WHISPERING): Where's my wedding video? Led Zeppelin continues.
PAT: I looked in here, but this is all your sewing shit up here, for your sewing and everything. Did you put it up here?
DOLORES: What about in your father's study?
PAT: (shouts O.S.) Dad, not now!
PAT: Would you put it in here? It makes no sense for you to put it in here.
PAT: He's got all his Eagles videos and not one video of my wedding!
PAT (CONT'D): Is it here? I mean....?
DOLORES: It's probably in the attic.
PAT: It feels to me like you wanna hide my wedding video.
DOLORES: Please stop yelling!
PAT: I'm not yelling, Mom, I'm just frustrated because I should have my fucking wedding video!
DOLORES: Pat! Pat!
(SPIRALING): I looked over there! I already looked all over there!
DOLORES: Calm down, Pat.
(YELLING): I'm not calming down! I don't give a fuck who hears, I'm not calming down! Anybody can wake up! I'm not ashamed of it! I'm not ashamed of it! Let the whole neighborhood wake up! I...
DOLORES: Pat! Stop it!
(YELLING): ...don't care!
(YELLING): Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
(YELLING): No, Mom!
PAT: (yelling and crying) I want it! It-...
(YELLING): Hey!
PAT: (yelling and crying) It's my wedding! It's my wedding video!
(YELLING): Pat!
(YELLING): Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
(YELLING): I can't watch my wedding video, but I CAN hear the fucking song in my head, goddamn it! He grabs his head, to stop hearing the wedding song.
PAT (CONT'D): Mom?
(YELLING): What the fuck you doing?! You...
PAT: Mom?
PAT: No, no, no, no, no!
(YELLING): Stop it!
PAT: Get off me, Dad!
DOLORES: Stop hitting him!
(SCREAMING): Stop hitting him!
(CRYING): I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
OFFICER KEOGH: Police!
OFFICER KEOGH: There are a lot of reports from your neighbors, we got a lot of phone calls.
PAT: Nikki is being manipulated and controlled. You have to talk to her.
OFFICER KEOGH: Hey, sit down.
DOLORES: It's a medication problem, but he's fine now.
OFFICER KEOGH: Oh yeah? He's fine now? You wanna send him back to Baltimore? We know all about the explosion at the psychiatrist's office.
DOLORES: What?
PAT: What explosion? No. Cliff is lying, that's not true. He's not allowed to talk about that.
DOLORES: Jesus Christ, who's that?
RICKY: Is this a bipolar episode?
RICKY: Someone, help me! Help me!
PAT: You can't tell Nikki about this, Officer.
OFFICER KEOGH: Look, I gotta make out a report.
PAT: No, no! No!
OFFICER KEOGH: She can see it by law.
DOLORES: Hey!
OFFICER KEOGH: Sit down.
PAT: No, no, no, listen, sir.
RICKYY: He's chasing me! This guy's chasing me! Help me!
OFFICER KEOGH: Sit down!
PAT: I'm sorry. I could just write you a letter and you could just let me have five minutes, explaining how much better I'm doing.
OFFICER KEOGH: There's a court order against you -- five hundred feet. Listen to me!
(TO ROSALIE): I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
PAT: ...this is not a reflection of where I'm at. You can't...please, you can't tell her any of this You can't tell Nikki about this.
OFFICER KEOGH: You need to pipe down.
DOLORES: Who was at the door?
PAT: Who was that, Dad?
OFFICER KEOGH: Good luck. I gotta write this up.
PAT: Come on, don't write it up! I don't want her to see this!
(RUNNING): Hey!
(RUNNING): What the hell?
TIFFANY: What happened to your face?
PAT: Weight lifting accident.
TIFFANY: That sounds like bullshit. Why'd you run by my house? Did our little conversation get you upset last night?
PAT: Hey, this is my route, okay? Just back off.
TIFFANY: This is my neighborhood. You just ran by my house.
PAT: I like to run by myself, okay?
TIFFANY: Me too.
PAT: (stops and turns) Hey, I like to run alone! Will you stop?
TIFFANY: What?
PAT: Okay? I'm running here!
TIFFANY: Me too!
PAT: Well then, why don't you run somewhere else? There's a fucking ton of roads to run in! What are you trying to do?
TIFFANY: I like this road. This is my neighborhood.
(SIGHS): Oh, come on, please!
TIFFANY: Calm down, crazy.
TIFFANY (CONT'D): Hey!
PAT: What the fuck?!
PAT (CONT'D): I'm married!
TIFFANY: So am I!
PAT: What the fuck are you doing? Your husband's dead!
TIFFANY: Where is your wife?
PAT: You're crazy!
TIFFANY: I'm not the one that just got out of that hospital in Baltimore.
PAT: I'm not the big slut!
(BREATHES HEAVILY): I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
TIFFANY: I was a big slut, but I'm not anymore. There's always gonna be a part of me that's sloppy and dirty, but I like that, with all the other parts of myself. Can you say the same about yourself, fucker?! Can you forgive? Are you any good at that?
PAT: Let me just set the record straight about last night. Hurting my mother was a mistake and I hate myself for it, and I hate my illness and I want to control it. My father, on the other hand, had no trouble slapping the shit out of me last night, which I did not return `cause I could've killed him and I didn't. He's sixty-five years old. You don't think I could've beat the shit out of him? I mean....
PAT: Yes, last night was a mess. Okay? And I think he probably just tried to do his best.
PAT: Yeah, but that's easier said than done.
PAT: Yeah, Excelsior. Listen, I have a letter I want you to give Nikki, okay?
PAT: Why?
(SIGHS): What good are you, man?
PAT: Oh, I don't know, because I'm married and I haven't seen my wife in eight and a half months?
PAT: Not bad, Doctor Jones. But I don't think I'm gonna blow it with Nikki because Tiffany's a slut.
PAT: After the dinner at Ronnie's, she said, quote, "We can go to the back house and you can fuck me as long as we turn the lights out." Unquote. And she still wears her wedding ring. So she's a loyal, married-to-a-dead-guy slut.
PAT: She said she's not a whore anymore, but she likes that part of herself along with all the other parts of herself and can I say the same?
PAT: Is that....? You're asking me, you're really asking me that question?
PAT: With all my crazy sad shit? What, are you fucking nuts?
PAT: No, not the books.
TIFFANY: Hey!
PAT: How do you know when I run?
TIFFANY: I wanted to clarify something. I just want us to be friends. (Pat doesn't answer) Did you hear what I said? (Pat doesn't answer still) Why are you giving me such a hard time?
PAT: No, I'm not giving you a hard time.
TIFFANY: I don't know how to act with you when you do this shit.
(WINDED): You wanna have dinner at this diner?
TIFFANY: Pick me up at seven thirty.
PAT: Happy Halloween.
TIFFANY: Hi.
WAITRESS: Here you go.
TIFFANY: Thank you.
PAT: I'm gonna have a bowl of your Raisin Bran.
TIFFANY: Tea.
WAITRESS: Be right back.
PAT: You look nice.
TIFFANY: Thanks.
WAITRESS: Raisin Bran. Milk.
TIFFANY: Thank you.
PAT: You want to share this?
TIFFANY: Why did you order Raisin Bran?
PAT: Why did you order tea?
(CHEWING): Because you ordered Raisin Bran.
PAT: I ordered Raisin Bran because I didn't want there to be any mistaking this for a date.
(CHEWING): It can still be a date if you order Raisin Bran.
PAT: It's not a date. So how's your thing going -- your dancing thing?
TIFFANY: It's good. How's your restraining order?
PAT: I wouldn't actually call the restraining order "my thing," but getting back with Nikki is, and I've been doing pretty well. Except for a minor incident at the doctor's office.
TIFFANY: And the so-called incident with the weights.
PAT: Yeah. That was a thing with my parents. I wish I could just explain it all in a letter to Nikki because it was minor and I could just explain it and let her know that I'm actually not out of control and that I'm actually doing really well.
TIFFANY: I can get a letter to Nikki. I see her sometimes with my sister.
PAT: It would be so amazing if you could get a letter to Nikki from me.
TIFFANY: I'd have to hide it from Veronica. She's not into breaking the law, which this letter would definitely be doing.
PAT: But you would do it?
TIFFANY: I'd have to be careful. I'm already on thin ice with my family, you should hear how I lost my job.
PAT: How did you lose your job?
TIFFANY: By...having sex with everybody in the office.
PAT: Everybody?
TIFFANY: I was very depressed after Tommy died. It was a lot of people.
PAT: We don't have to talk about it.
TIFFANY: Thanks.
PAT: How many were there?
TIFFANY: Eleven.
PAT: Wow.
TIFFANY: I know.
PAT: I'm not gonna talk about it anymore.
TIFFANY: Okay.
PAT: Can I ask you one more question? Were there any women?
TIFFANY: Yes.
PAT: Really?
TIFFANY: Yes.
PAT: What was that like?
TIFFANY: Hot.
PAT: Jesus Christ. Was it like...older women, a sexy teacher who wants to
TIFFANY: Made me sit on her lap and do things? Yeah.
PAT: What? You sat on her lap?
TIFFANY: Mm-hmm.
PAT: She told you what to do?
TIFFANY: Mm-hmm.
PAT: Oh...my God. Nikki hated when I talked like this. Made me feel like such a pervert. Maybe we should change the subject.
TIFFANY: I don't mind it.
PAT: You don't, do you.
TIFFANY: No. But then people were getting into fights in the parking lot at work, and in the bathroom...and the boss called me in to his office and tried to pin it all on me. So I accused him of harassment and then they fired me, sent me home and put me on some meds.
PAT: I get it. The song that was playing when my wife...was in the shower with the history teacher...
TIFFANY: I heard about that.
PAT: ...it was my wedding song and when I hear it, I go kinda crazy. Sometimes I hear it when it's not even playing.
TIFFANY: Wow.
PAT: Yeah. So they put me on medication, which I feel ashamed of.
TIFFANY: Yeah.
PAT: So I know.
TIFFANY: You do.
PAT: I just gotta get a strategy, you know?
TIFFANY: Me too.
PAT: We'd better get back to the letter.
TIFFANY: Yeah, let's get back to the letter.
PAT: What if you told Nikki when Veronica was in the bathroom?
TIFFANY: Yes. Yes, that could work. I love that.
PAT: Oh, my God, I'm gonna go home and write the letter right now.
TIFFANY: Can I at least finish my tea?
PAT: Wait, what?
TIFFANY: My tea. Can I finish it?
PAT: Wait a minute. Did Veronica tell Nikki about our dinner? Why would she do that? Was it a test?
TIFFANY: I kinda got that feeling, yeah.
PAT: Goddamn it. I knew it. It was a test. How did I do? I think I did pretty well.
TIFFANY: Yeah, she said you were cool, basically.
PAT: "Basically"? Was I some percentage not cool?
TIFFANY: No, she said you were cool, but you know.
PAT: No, I don't know.
TIFFANY: Sort of how you are. It's fine, relax.
PAT: What do you mean? How am I? What does that mean?
TIFFANY: Sort of like me.
PAT: "Sort of like you"? I hope to God she didn't tell Nikki that.
TIFFANY: Why?
PAT: Because, it's just not right, lumping you and I together, I mean, it's just wrong. And Nikki wouldn't like that. Especially after all the shit you just told me.
TIFFANY: You think that I'm crazier than you.
(SCOFFS) (CHUCKLING): Because, well, we're different, I
TIFFANY: Oh, my God. Ugh. You're killing me. You know what? Forget I offered to help you. Forget the entire fucking idea. `Cause that must have been fucking crazy because I am so much crazier than you.
PAT: Keep your voice down.
TIFFANY: I'm just the crazy slut with a dead husband!
TIFFANY (CONT'D): Forget it!
PAT: Shut the fuck up.
TIFFANY: Fuck you!
TIFFANY (CONT'D): You shut the fuck up!
PAT: Tiffany! Hey! Tiffany!
WAITRESS: Slow down, Raisin Bran.
PAT: Hey, come on. Look, I don't think you're crazy, all right?
TIFFANY: Yes, you do.
PAT: No, I don't.
TIFFANY: You told your therapist that you were in a superior mental illness category, didn't you?
PAT: What? Hey, calm down! Hey--
TIFFANY: Just leave me alone!
PAT: Can I just explain myself, please? I didn't want Nikki to think that I was associated with that kind of sexual behavior because I've never done anything like that, okay?
TIFFANY: You may not have experienced the shit that I did. But you loved hearing about it, didn't you? You are afraid to be alive, you're afraid to live. You're a hypocrite. You're a conformist. You're a liar. I opened up to you and you judged me. You are an asshole. You are an asshole!
TIFFANY (CONT'D): Get off of me! (yelling) Get off! You're harassing me!
PAT: Hey, hey!
(YELLING): He's harassing me!
PAT: Shut up!
TIFFANY: Get off!
(TO PAT): Take it easy. Dude, relax.
PAT: Bro, get off of me.
(YELLING)): He's harassing me!!
PAT: Hey, hey, stop, stop. Stop, all right?
PAT (CONT'D): Hey, get off of me! Shut up, shut up.
PAT (CONT'D): Stop it.
PAT (CONT'D): Hey, hey, hey, get off me!
OFFICER KEOGH: What are you doing? Come on. What are you doing? What are you doing to these kids?
PAT: I didn't, I didn't, I didn't-- TIFFANY WATCHES IN THE CROWD OF HALLOWEEN TEENS. Softens.
TIFFANY: It's the kids! [Walks to Pat and Officer Keogh]. He didn't do anything, it was all the kids. Officer Keogh turns to push the crowd back.
OFFICER KEOGH: (walks crowd back) Let's go, clear out, nothing going on here.
TIFFANY: You gonna go your whole life scared of that song? It's just a song. Don't make it a monster. She leans close to Pat's downcast face.
TIFFANY (CONT'D): There's no song playing. There's no song. Breathe, count backwards from ten. That's it. Pat breathes, listens to her. Calms himself. Song stops. Tiffany's face stays close to his.
TIFFANY (CONT'D): That's it. There you go. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
PAT: I'm sorry.
TIFFANY: I took it too far.
PAT: I'm sorry.
OFFICER KEOGH: (pulls her away) Hey, is he messing with you?
TIFFANY: No, no. No, this was just a joke. This is a joke I started.
OFFICER KEOGH: There's a restraining order on this guy.
TIFFANY: I know, I have a stupid sense of humor.
OFFICER KEOGH: That's not a good thing to do.
TIFFANY: Well, I'm fucked up. What can I tell you? I'm sorry.
OFFICER KEOGH: You're Tommy's widow, right?
TIFFANY: Yes, I'm Tommy's crazy whore widow, minus the whore thing for the most part.
OFFICER KEOGH: You're a funny girl. You wanna get a drink sometime?
PAT: She doesn't, she doesn't do that anymore.
PAT: I'm sorry about what I said in the diner.
TIFFANY: I know. I know you didn't mean it.
PAT: I didn't mean it at all.
TIFFANY: I know, you say shit you don't mean all the time.
PAT: All the time.
TIFFANY: I'll still give your letter to Nikki, don't worry. TIFFANY WALKS THE DRIVEWAY TOWARD HER GARAGE. Pat watches her go.
PAT: Wow. I really appreciate that, Tiffany.
(WALKING AWAY): I know you do.
PAT: You do?
(DISHEARTENED): Yeah, sure.
PAT: I'll see you tomorrow? With the letter?
RANDY: I'll bet I know what happened if only one is missing. Either Dolores or Pat needed an envelope and one of `em took it. That's the only answer.
DOLORES: Maybe we should call the FBI.
PAT: Dad, I borrowed one of your envelopes. I hope that's not a
DOLORES: "Do not go in my study or I will eat you!"
RANDY: Dolores, you are so beautiful!
(TO RANDY): Stop that! Hey, hey, hey, stop, stop, stop!
(TO PAT): Listen, a lot of envelopes go in and out of my office every day after games with a lot of cash in `em. So show some respect for what I do.
PAT: Yeah, I know. I saw two-seven-four. I just wanted to tell you the number.
PAT: But the envelope was empty. I'm sorry, you were sleeping. I didn't want to wake you, but I needed an envelope.
DOLORES: Be nice. It's game day! I'm makin' crabby snacks and homemades.
PAT: Yeah, come on, Dad, be nice. Come on, she's making crabby snacks and homemades. Come on, Dad!
DOLORES: He's very happy.
PAT: I'm happy.
PAT: Isn't that a good thing?
PAT: Am I taking the right dose? Of course I am.
PAT: No, if I was taking that, I'd be on the floor, Dad.
PAT: Dad, I can't. Look, I'm ready to go.
PAT: Wait, you mean OCD, superstitious time?
RANDY: Come on, your dad needs a winner. Help him out.
PAT: I can't.
DOLORES: What are you up to, Pat?
PAT: Nothing, come on.
DOLORES: What's in the envelope?
PAT: Guys, I'm beating the song! I'm on the scoreboard! I'm playing down field! I feel great!
PAT: Tiffany!
PAT (CONT'D): Hey, how you doin'? Is Tiffany here?
TIFFANY'S MOTHER: What do you want with her?
TIFFANY'S FATHER: Is that another creep? What do you want, creep? Just beat it.
PAT: Whoa, no, no, no. No, I'm married.
TIFFANY'S FATHER: Oh, great, a married creep.
PAT: I'm her friend.
PAT (CONT'D): We go running. Have you guys not seen us? I took her to the diner.
TIFFANY'S MOTHER: She's not here.
JORDIE: Hi, guys. How's it going? Hey. Is Tiffany home?
TIFFANY'S MOTHER: Go away.
JORDIE: I know her. I know her, we've dated. We still date.
PAT: What are you doing here?
JORDIE: I've called her, I've texted her.
PAT: Do you know this guy?
JORDIE: I still haven't heard back. We used to work together--
TIFFANY'S FATHER: Just get the hell out of here...
JORDIE: I just wanted to give you my card to give to her.
TIFFANY'S FATHER: Another rude creep.
PAT: Listen to what he's saying. Listen to what he's saying.
JORDIE: What's he saying?
PAT: He's saying you're being rude.
JORDIE: How am I being rude?
PAT: Oh, you know. You know. Come on. Sometimes it's okay with girls like this, they wanna have fun and
PAT: --it's not because they got a broken wing, and they're hurt, and they're an easy target. And in this case, in this particular case, I think that wing is being fixed.
PAT: And you gotta make sure it gets mended. And you're gettin' in the way of that right now, okay? Because she's sensitive and she's smart, she's artistic. This is a great girl and you gotta be respectful of that. Come on.
PAT (CONT'D): Let me walk you down to your car. You're a better guy than this. I can see it in your eyes.
JORDIE: She just texted me!
PAT: Hey! Hey, wait a second! What are you doing? What happened? How come you weren't outside? What the hell's going on?
TIFFANY: I can't, I can't do it.
PAT: What do you mean, you can't do it? You can't do what?
TIFFANY: I can't give the letter to Nikki.
PAT: Tiffany, what are you talking about? What do you mean you can't give the letter to Nikki?
TIFFANY: Because what am I getting in return? What are you doing for me?
PAT: You said! You said if I wrote a letter, you'd get it to Nikki.
TIFFANY: I know.
PAT: That was the set-up.
TIFFANY: Because I do this time after time after time, I do all this shit for other people and then I wake up and, and I'm empty, I have nothing!
PAT: What are you talking about? You seem like you're a tough girl to me. Why don't you just do things on your own?
TIFFANY: I always get myself in these fucking situations. I give everything to other people and nobody ever, I never -- I don't get what I want, okay? I'm not my sister. Pat takes this in.
PAT: Alright, well, ask for you. What can I do for you?
TIFFANY: I can't do it.
PAT: Tiffany, what do you want me to do?
PAT (CONT'D): Think of something.
TIFFANY: There's this thing.
PAT: There's a thing, okay. What kind of thing?
TIFFANY: It's a thing, it's a thing. It's a, it's a dance thing.
PAT: It's a dance thing, all right.
TIFFANY: It's a competition thing at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel. Tommy would never do it with me and I missed it every single year.
PAT: Well, Tommy's dead, so he's not gonna fucking do it.
TIFFANY: Would you please!
PAT: I don't have a filter when I talk.
TIFFANY: Can we have one conversation without you reminding me that my goddamn husband is dead? My God.
PAT: Yes, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay, I'm sorry.
TIFFANY: But I can only do it if I have a partner...and now I'm about to miss it for another year.
PAT: Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm not gonna fuckin' dance with you. What are you talking about?
TIFFANY: What, your schedule is so busy? "Grapes of Wrath" and watching football with your dad?
PAT: Tiffany, I'm not gonna do a dance with you.
TIFFANY: All right, then I'm not giving her your fucking letter.
PAT: Wait a second! But you promised you would do this.
TIFFANY: Think about it.
PAT: Well, I already did do something for you, you know.
PAT: I took care of that jerkoff that was in front of your house.
TIFFANY: What? Jordie?
PAT: Let me ask you something. Do you call him when you're lonely?
PAT (CONT'D): That encourages him, Tiffany. You shouldn't do it.
TIFFANY: Couldn't you say the same about you and Nikki?
PAT: It's not at all like me and Nikki. What are you talking about? We're in love and we're married. It's completely different.
TIFFANY: How are you in love? Tell me about that. The big Nikki love. Tell me about it, I wanna understand it.
PAT: We have a very unconventional chemistry, it makes people feel awkward, but not me. She's the most beautiful woman I've ever been with.
TIFFANY: Wow.
PAT: It's electric between us, okay? Yeah, we wanna change each other, but that's normal, couples wanna do that, I want her to stop dressing like she dresses, I want her to stop acting so superior to me, okay? And she wanted me to lose weight and stop my mood swings, both of which I've done. I mean, people fight. Couples fight. We would fight, we wouldn't talk for a couple weeks. That's normal. She always wanted the best for me. Tiffany listens.
PAT (CONT'D): She wanted me to be passionate and compassionate. And that's a good thing. You know? I just, look, I'm my best self today, and I think she's her best self today, and our love's gonna be fucking amazing.
TIFFANY: It's gonna be amazing, and you're gonna be amazing, and she's gonna be amazing, and you're not gonna be that guy that's gonna take advantage of a situation without offering to do something back. So think about the dance thing.
DANNY: I'm out.
DANNY (CONT'D): It's official, man. They didn't convert me to my Mental Hygiene Law admission status within two thirds of the maximum length of my felony sentence, so I'm out. They had to let me go.
PAT: I never understand what he's saying.
(LAUGHS): What a treat!
PAT: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Dad's got you sitting here?
DANNY: He calls me "Jailhouse Lawyer."
DANNY: Okay.
PAT: And now you're holding the remote?
DANNY: And it's working. Your dad's a genius. PAT SR. URGES DANNY TO SIT UP STRAIGHTER with remote.
PAT: And Danny's the good luck charm?
DANNY: Yeah, you're the one, Pat.
PAT: Superstition, Danny. I don't know.
PAT: Dad, Dad, Dad. She's my friend. Why would you say that?
RONNIE: Oh, she's a mess. You gotta be careful. She goes to a lot of therapy.
PAT: I go to a lot of therapy, Ronnie. What are you trying to say?
RONNIE: I'm just saying--
(INTERRUPTING) ): Am I messed up?
PAT (CONT'D): Why don't you stop judging people? You judge everybody. You're the one who has a messed up marriage.
RONNIE: I'm just looking out for you, I'm just looking out for you. She's unstable.
(ALARMED): What's wrong with your marriage? What's wrong with your marriage?
RONNIE: Nothing's wrong!
PAT: You should have seen when I was at his house. It's like a circus over there.
RONNIE: Shh, shh.
PAT: What are you talking about? I'm not gonna hide this. You need to deal with it.
RONNIE: Stop breaking my balls.
PAT: Oh!!!!
RONNIE: I got you an iPod.
PAT: Whoa! Is this for me?
RONNIE: Yeah. Well, that's my old iPod, but-
(HUGS RONNIE): Oh, buddy, thank you. That's so nice of you. Wow.
RONNIE: Thirty-two gigabytes.
PAT: How many songs is that?
RONNIE: Seven thousand.
PAT: (scrolling through iPod) Oh, yeah, you got The Stranglers. You love The Stranglers. Oh, the Sex Pistols. The Clash.
RONNIE: Got some Clash.
PAT: Oh, "West Side Story."
RONNIE: Yeah, "West Side Story." It makes me peaceful.
(SINGING): "Maria, I just met a girl named Maria..."
PAT: Right, right, right.
RONNIE: And then when I'm angry, which is a lot these days, I go to the garage...Metallica...Megadeth. I start fucking smashing shit.
PAT: You gotta get your marriage together.
(WHISPERING): I start breaking shit, and I hurt my hand. And --
PAT: Ronnie, that's fucked up.
RONNIE: Yeah, but it makes me feel better. It's like my therapy, you know?
PAT: When I'm with Nikki, I'm never gonna do stuff like that...
JAKE (CONT'D): A restraining order is nothing to fool with, bro. [Walks down to Pat]. Holy shit, look at you! You are fit! You look absolutely amazing. You feel good?
PAT: How you doing, Jake?
JAKE: Good. You look like Schwarzenegger in his prime.
DOLORES: Didn't I say you wouldn't recognize him?
JAKE: So, listen, I'm sorry that I didn't come see you down at the hospital. You know how those places creep me out, and the firm's been expanding. I've been helping Pop with the restaurant `cause he needs to have a legitimate business. He needs a tax return. With all the money that he's making with his bookmaking, they're gonna come after him. And then it looks like I'm making, I'm gonna make partner at the firm. Pat just stares at Jake. The room is silent.
JAKE (CONT'D): Well, I don't even know what to say to you anymore. You lost your wife, I'm getting engaged, and I wanna be able to tell you about those kind of things. You lost your house, I'm getting a new house. You lost your job, things are going great for me at the firm.
JAKE: You know what, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna stop talking. I'm gonna shut my mouth. Pat stares down Jake. Tense.
PAT: As my friend Danny would say 00 The room hangs on Pat's words.
PAT (CONT'D): I got nothing but love for you, brother.
DANNY: That's right. That's right.
PAT: DeSean Jackson.
JAKE: Yeah. Did it fit?
PAT: I wore it to Ronnie's for dinner.
RONNIE: Beautiful jersey. I love that jersey.
PAT: Veronica didn't like it.
RONNIE: Veronica hates the jersey.
JAKE: Whatever you do, watch out for that restraining order, okay?
PAT: I'm not doing anything!
RONNIE: Don't let Tiffany get you in trouble.
DOLORES: Pat, you're up to something, I know.
PAT: People like Tiffany, or Danny, or me, maybe we know something that you guys don't know, okay? Did you ever think about that? Maybe we understand something because we're
DANNY: We have a sixth sense. I mean, everybody's got it. Everybody's just not in touch with it.
DOLORES: Oh, no.
OFFICER KEOGH: How you doing, Pat?
PAT: Jesus.
(RE: DANNY): I'm taking him back to the hospital.
PAT: What? No, no, he passed his thing, right?
DANNY: First of all, check with the latest legal development.
OFFICER KEOGH: Well, we got a call that they did convert you to a Mental Hygiene Law admission status by the deadline of your sentence, so....
(TO KEOGH): Wait a minute. Are you an Eagles fan or are you not an Eagles fan?
OFFICER KEOGH: I'm an Eagles fan.
OFFICER KEOGH: I don't know what the hell you're talking about "the handkerchief". And I'm glad that the Seahawks are losing and we're winning, but I gotta take Danny McDaniels back to Baltimore, alright? He can contest his case from Baltimore.
DANNY: Not correct about the Mental Hygiene Law. You're not correct.
OFFICER KEOGH: Come on.
DANNY: You guys oughta be ashamed of yourselves.
TIFFANY: I used the insurance money to build this. I designed it. All the floors are hard oak. It has good bounce for dancers.
PAT: Wow.
TIFFANY: I'm not that great of a dancer, but who cares? It's therapy and it's fun. And the walls are good `cause I can play music really loud without anybody hearing.
PAT: Where do you sleep?
TIFFANY: Upstairs. It's a garage, I just renovated it. You know, I was thinking about putting a ballet barre here.
PAT: When are you gonna give it to her?
TIFFANY: What?
PAT: The letter to Nikki.
TIFFANY: Probably tonight.
PAT: Really?
TIFFANY: Ronnie and Veronica and I are gonna see her tonight.
PAT: Oh, I actually changed the first paragraph. I did this thing about Shakespeare and how it's very
TIFFANY: Mm-hmm.
PAT: -and that maybe in the future if she wanted to go dancing, I can be able to do that because of all the
(INTERRUPTING): No, that's good, that's really good.
PAT: I assume you're a good teacher.
TIFFANY: Yeah. I mean, I hope so.
PAT: Maybe you can teach us both, you know what I mean?
PAT (CONT'D): And I also mentioned how generous it is, what I'm doing for you.
TIFFANY: Yeah. Mm-hmm. It's really generous.
PAT: You know, being of service.
TIFFANY: Yeah.
PAT: To your need.
TIFFANY: Uh-huh.
TIFFANY (CONT'D): All right, let's start simple. Start at that corner, walk towards me. Walk across the room. Pat stands in the corner, doesn't move.
PAT: Can we do something else besides the dance deal?
TIFFANY: Are you fucking kidding me?
PAT: I'm good with a hammer. You want me to fix something?
TIFFANY: A deal is a deal.
PAT: I know. Okay. I was just suggesting that maybe there's a better scenario.
TIFFANY: Why don't you walk towards me like I'm Nikki. And the only way to convey how much you've missed me is by your walk. By your slow walk. You can't talk.
PAT: I'm not doing it.
TIFFANY: Only walk. Do it.
PAT: No. That's stupid.
TIFFANY: No walk, no letter. Walk to me like I'm Nikki, come on. Do it. I'm Nikki. Come on.
PAT: (under his breath) You're not Nikki.
TIFFANY: Don't look up until you're halfway here.
TIFFANY (CONT'D): That's right.
TIFFANY (CONT'D): Not yet.
TIFFANY (CONT'D): Yes. Do you feel that? That's emotion.
PAT: I don't feel anything.
TIFFANY: Has anybody ever told you how Tommy died?
PAT: No.
TIFFANY: We were married for three years and five days, and I loved him. But for the last couple months, I just wasn't into sex at all. It just felt like we were so different and I was depressed. Some of that is just me, some of it was he wanted me to have kids and I have a hard enough time taking care of myself. I don't think that makes me a criminal. Anyway one night after dinner, he drove to Victoria's Secret at King of Prussia Mall and got some lingerie to get something going. And on the way back, he stopped on 76 to help a guy with a flat tire and he got hit by a car and killed. And the Victoria's Secret box was still in the front seat. (pause) That's a feeling.
TIFFANY (CONT'D): Okay, this is the waltz. I'm gonna teach you the waltz step.
DOLORES: Whoa! Slow down.
PAT: What?
DOLORES: Your father wanted you to have this.
PAT: He wants me to have-
PAT (CONT'D): -all this Eagles information.
DOLORES: It's his living.
PAT: Um, tell Dad thanks.
DOLORES: Your father expects to spend time with you, Pat.
TIFFANY: Football stays out of this place, so does "Lord of the Flies."
PAT: Wait, wait, no, no, no, what are you doing? I'm behind on my syllabus.
TIFFANY: I don't give a fuck.
PAT: What the hell are you doing?
PAT: Did you just throw that outside?
TIFFANY: What? You're not gonna read that shit on my time. I can tell you all about the "Lord of the Flies." It's a bunch of boys on an island and they have a conch -- they have a shell -- and whoever has the conch has the power and they can talk. And if you don't have the conch, then you don't have the power. And then there's a little chubby boy, and they call him Piggy and they're really mean, and then there's a murder. I mean, humanity is just nasty and there's no silver lining.
PAT: Wow. That was a great synopsis. I still need to read it, though.
PAT (CONT'D): Who's that?
PAT (CONT'D): What the....? (laughing) What are you doing here, man?
DANNY: If one of your two supervising physicians loses their license, then your whole ajudication is thrown out.
PAT: How'd you know we were here?
DANNY: I went by your parents' house looking for you and they told me you was over here.
PAT: Danny, this is Tiffany. (to Tiffany) Tiffany, this is Danny.
TIFFANY: Hello. Pat told me about you.
DANNY: So is the girl, that you wrote about?
PAT: Yeah.
TIFFANY: What? He wrote about me? I'm "the girl"?
DANNY: He wrote about you, all right.
TIFFANY: What'd he say?
DANNY: He said you guys was helping each other out and you were nice and had a mouth on you, that you were mouthy, but--
PAT: Whoa, whoa, that's enough.
TIFFANY: No, please, tell me more about what he said in the letter.
PAT: Yeah, anything you wanna know, I'll just tell you. It was nothing. It was just a very general letter.
TIFFANY: Cool.
DANNY: (looks at Tiffany) She's fine.
PAT: She is my friend with an "F."
DANNY: A capital "F."
PAT: For "friend." The three stand there awkwardly for a beat.
DANNY: Hey, can I see what you guys are doing?
PAT: Yeah.
TIFFANY: Okay.
TIFFANY (CONT'D): And then this goes into something else.
DANNY: That's it?
PAT: Why? What is it, what is it, what is it.
DANNY: Can I say something? Do you mind?
TIFFANY: No.
DANNY: You sure?
PAT: Just say it. Say it.
TIFFANY: No, please.
DANNY: I think Pat, you should be facing Tiffany.
DANNY (CONT'D): Let me show you, Pat, let me show you what I mean. You gotta come at her with a little bit more soul, man.
(TO TIFFANY): You should move more hips.
(TO PAT): Just, just sort of come in, Pat, come in like this. And....
PAT: Okay.
DANNY: Yeah. Can you move `em a little bit more? Yeah, that's it. Move `em a bit more.
DANNY (CONT'D): You could turn around, too, there's nothing wrong with that. Yeah. You're pretty good.
(HUMS): Mm, yeah.
PAT: Okay, we got it, we got it.
DANNY: Okay. Okay.
DANNY (CONT'D): Come on, Pat, come on. A little bit more soul. Black it up, Pat.
PAT: "Black it up"?
DANNY: You know damn well what it means.
DANNY (CONT'D): Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Oh, man! I got an idea.
DANNY (CONT'D): Come get some, Pat. Come get some.
DANNY (CONT'D): Shuffle back, shuffle back. Shuffle back, shuffle back. Girl, you gotta move your junk.
DANNY (CONT'D): I gotta get out of here. I gotta go see this girl, Tanya. She lives on this side of town.
PAT: Yeah, go see Tanya. Good idea.
DANNY: Okay, man, hey. I'm gonna be there, man. I want you guys to win!
TIFFANY: Bye!
DANNY: Excelsior, Pat!
PAT: Excelsior!
DANNY: That's my man.
PAT: I didn't realize that.
PAT: Okay.
PAT: Right.
RANDY: He's betting everything on the Giant game. Everything.
RANDY (CONT'D): All the money that he needs for the restaurant, he's betting on the Giant game.
RANDY: Because he believes in you.
PAT: Is that true?
PAT: Yeah.
PAT: You want me to go to the game with Jake?
JAKE: Does he want me to go?
PAT: He told you that?
PAT: Even with all his friends?
PAT: He's not embarrassed?
RANDY: Listen, personally, I think it's a stupid bet. As a matter of fact, I think it's ridiculous to bet all that dough for the restaurant on a game.
PAT: I made a commitment to Tiffany about a project, and we have a very important part of it that we have to go over on Sunday, and it's good for me, Dad. It's making me disciplined and focused, and it's, it's--, I never would've thought this, but it's a good thing.
DOLORES: Yeah, what is it? What is this project, hon?
PAT: It's a dance thing, okay? There's nothing more to it, Dad. I swear.
PAT: Listen, I need to ask you something.
PAT (CONT'D): Tomorrow can I spend half the day with you and half the day at the Eagles game?
TIFFANY: I'm gonna pretend that you didn't just ask me that.
PAT: Why?
TIFFANY: These are the two days that you have promised me and that we have prepared to nail the big move. It's not ready yet. And we don't have a move yet.
PAT: I know, but my dad opened up to me and it was really beautiful and I wanna be of service to him, okay? And he's worried that the juju from the Eagles is being fucked up and he's concerned that it's because I'm spending time with you.
TIFFANY: Oh, I messed up the Eagles' juju?
PAT: No, you're not messing up the juju, but the juju is messed up because I'm not with him during the games.
TIFFANY: Guess what?
PAT: What?
TIFFANY: Nikki replied to your letter.
(INTERRUPTING): But you can't read it until after you nail the big move. Go.
PAT: Tiff, I'm sorry. I can't do anything else without reading Nikki's letter, okay? It's just--, it's in the back of my head. We don't almost have it, all right?
TIFFANY: I just hope you can handle it.
PAT: Thank you.
PAT (CONT'D): What was her energy when she gave it to you?
TIFFANY: She was intrigued, excited, and a little scared.
PAT: She was scared? About what? Did she tell you?
TIFFANY: Try to stay positive.
PAT: I'm just gonna read it out loud, okay? Because if she says anything that's, you know, is that too much to ask?
TIFFANY: No.
TIFFANY (CONT'D): I thought you were gonna read it out loud.
PAT: Okay. Sorry.
PAT (CONT'D): "Dear Pat, It was very emotional for me to get your letter, as I'm sure you can imagine, but I'm glad you took the risk of discreetly getting it to me through Tiffany. This gives us a chance to communicate while I keep the restraining order until I feel safe. I must admit you sound terrific and I'm happy that you are feeling so positive and becoming a more loving and caring man, which I always knew you were. I was moved to read about `Excelsior' and your belief in happy endings. I am also moved by your act of love to read the books I have taught at the high school. I'm sorry you find them so negative, but I disagree. I think they are great works of art that reflect how hard life can be and they can also help kids prepare themselves for the hardness of life. In spite of all these positive developments, Pat, I have to say if it's me reading the signs, I need to see something to prove you are ready to resume our marriage. Otherwise I find myself thinking that we might both be better off moving on with our lives separately. Please don't react quickly to this, but take time to think about it. I'm glad you're doing so well. Love, Nikki." PAT FOLDS UP THE LETTER AGAIN. He is kind of crying.
PAT (CONT'D): I think I'm done for today, okay?
TIFFANY: (follows him to door) She said to show her something, Pat. This dance can be that something. You would have never done something like this in a million years. It shows all kinds of skills on so many different levels: focus, collaboration, discipline. It's romantic, like I said it would be. It's for her.
PAT: (over his shoulder) Thanks for the letter. I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
PAT: Can I use your phone?
PAT: Yeah, kind of.
PAT: Well, I'm just doing this project with Tiffany and I wanted to tell her I'm not gonna be on time.
PAT: She's not crazy -- I'll just borrow Jake's phone. It's too bad you can't come in to the stadium, but I know you were kicked out, you know, for beating everybody up. Guess we're not that different, huh, Dad?
PAT: No, I think, it's a good thing.
PAT: Yeah. I'm solid.
JAKE: This is my little brother Pat.
PAT: Hey, how you doing?
GUY #1: So, Pat, what's this I hear about you just gettin' out?
GUY #2: (laughs) Yeah, from the looney bin!
JAKE: What the fuck?! I talked to you about that already!
JAKE (CONT'D): I told you guys--
(INTERRUPTING): It's all right.
JAKE: Huh? No.
PAT: It's alright.
GUY #2: He's a good dude! He's a good dude.
JAKE: Oh, shit! The Asian invasion!
JAKE (CONT'D): They're here every week!
PAT: (can't believe his eyes) No!
GUY #1: Uh, Jake you better get your brother.
GUY #2: Cuckoo bird's takin' off.
PAT: Doctor Patel!
PAT: Hey! What are you doing here?
PAT: I'm not supposed to be seeing you, right? Outside the office?
PAT: That's illegal!
PAT: Hey, Jake this is Cliff. This is my doctor, Cliff.
JAKE: Look, two things. We gotta watch that bubble screen for fuckin' Manning in the backfield and we gotta make sure we knock the receivers on their ass on the line of scrimmage.
RONNIE: Okay, you know what? I don't have her phone number. If you want, if you really want, you can call Veronica `cause she does, but I don't want to talk to Veronica.
PAT: Why don't you wanna talk to Veronica?
RONNIE: Because she brings me down, man! She just brings me down.
PAT: You have to change. You're not gonna throw the marriage away. There's some kind of love there. I know, I used to see it.
PAT (CONT'D): You guys have a beautiful thing that got broken somewhere along the line and you gotta fix it like a chiropractor. You gotta give it a chiropractic adjustment.
PAT (CONT'D): Enough with awkwardness! I don't wanna walk in your house and not be able to say what I wanna say.
RONNIE: You're right, man. You're right, you're right, you're right, you're right, man.
FAN #1: Eagles, baby! Yeah! Let's go!
FAN #1 (CONT'D): What the fuck? What's that smell?
FAN #1 (CONT'D): Nasty Indian curry! This is America, baby! Go back to your country!
PAT: What, what's wrong?
INDIAN MAN: Hey!
RONNIE: Whoa, whoa, what's going on?
JAKE: Stay back, Pat. Stay back.
JAKE (CONT'D): Leave the fucking Indians alone.
RONNIE: Stay here, stay here!
PAT: I'm not gonna go anywhere.
RONNIE: Don't get in a fight!
PAT: I'm not gonna fight. I'm not gonna fight.
(YELLING): Hey, not my brother! Hey, hey, hey!
(OVER BULLHORN): Break it up or you'll be arrested!
(INTERRUPTING): What the fuck happened?
PAT: Dad.
PAT: I am solid. I was solid at the game, Dad. I'm solid, I'm solid now.
PAT: No, Dad!
(YELLING): It's all fucking ruined now! It's all fucking ruined!
PAT: No, Dad, Dad, Dad, don't!
(YELLING): It's all ruined, you little fucking shit!
PAT: No, Dad! I didn't do a fucking thing! Come on, Dad!
(YELLING): You loser! You loser!
(EMOTIONAL): I'm not a loser.
TIFFANY: We need to talk right now! When you make a serious commitment to somebody, it is not cool to not show up!
PAT: Wait a second, I tried to call, my God, what's happening, I called--, but I tried to call you, Tiffany,
TIFFANY: Oh, really?
PAT: Yes.
PAT (CONT'D): I told you I was gonna split my time with my dad and you, and my dad was pulling me in one direction. Doctor Patel, Ronnie--
TIFFANY: Well, that sounds great, Pat. That's great for all of them, but all of them didn't make a commitment to me in return for my help. I'm Tiffany, by the way.
PAT: There's no craziness. I told you who she was, I was doing this thing with her. We had a conversation!
TIFFANY: You think I fucked up the Eagles' juju, don't you?
(INTERRUPTING): You think that I'm why today's happened?
TIFFANY: I'm the reason why today happened?
TIFFANY: Let's talk about that.
TIFFANY: The first night that Pat and I met at my sister's, the Eagles beat the Forty Niners handily, forty to twenty-six. The second time we got together we went for a run and the Phillies beat the Dodgers seven to five in the NLCS.
JAKE: She's right, Dad.
TIFFANY: The next time we went for a run the Eagles beat the Falcons, twenty- seven to fourteen.
PAT: Wow.
TIFFANY: The third time we got together we had Raisin Bran in the diner and the Phillies dominated Tampa Bay in the fourth game of the World Series, ten to two.
PAT: Oh, wow.
TIFFANY: Well, why don't you think about when the Eagles beat the Seahawks, fourteen to seven.
TIFFANY: He was with me. We went for a run.
RONNIE: Really? That's crazy.
TIFFANY: There have been no games since Pat and I have been rehearsing every day and if Pat had been with me like he was supposed to, he wouldn't have gotten in a fight, he wouldn't be in trouble, maybe the Eagles beat the New York Giants.
JAKE: She's making a lot of sense, Pop. That's all right on all counts.
TIFFANY: Does anybody here happen to know what the official motto of the state of New York is on the official seal of the State of New York? Huh? Anybody? (to Pat Sr.) Do you? Do you know? "Excelsior." Look it up. Yeah, "Excelsior."
DOLORES: Oh Pat.
TIFFANY: Not that I give a fuck about football or about your superstitions, but if it's me reading the signs, I don't send the Eagles guy whose personal motto is "Excelsior," to a fucking Giants game, especially when he's already in a legal situation.
RONNIE: Unbelievable.
PAT: Wow. How did you know all that stuff?
TIFFANY: I did my research.
TIFFANY: Thank you.
PAT: Oh, now you like her, Dad?
RANDY: Patrizio, I feel terrible, you know? You made the bet, I won a lot of money, and now look, your whole family is in turmoil.
TIFFANY: Oh, fuck off, Randy. You love it. You live for this shit. You've been betting against my father for years.
PAT: Is that right?
TIFFANY: You're twisting the knife right now. You get off on it!
RANDY: That's bullshit! That's not true! Don't say that!
TIFFANY: You get off on it! If not, then prove it. Prove it.
RANDY: How do you want me to prove it?
TIFFANY: By giving them the chance to win back everything, double or nothing.
PAT: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
RANDY: Double or nothing on the Bengals, next week? Is that what you're saying?
TIFFANY: No.
TIFFANY (CONT'D): Against the Cowboys.
TIFFANY (CONT'D): That's your team isn't it, Randy?
PAT: That's his team!
TIFFANY: I know who his team is.
RANDY: When is the game?
TIFFANY: December twenty-eight, last game of the season.
PAT: Oh, my God.
TIFFANY: Same day as the Benjamin Franklin Pairs Open Freestyle Dance Competition.
DOLORES: Oh God.
TIFFANY: Yeah, Randy, don't you believe in America's Team?
RANDY: Yeah, I believe in America's Team but if I win that bet, I win your book, you're out of action, you get no restaurant, no nothing.
DOLORES: No. No, Patrizio--
PAT: Dad!
DOLORES: Patrizio, don't! It's toxic!
PAT: Dad, listen to me. I didn't know that "Excelsior" was the state motto of New York, okay?
PAT: I know, but listen to me, this is toxic. Dad, Dad, Dad, this is toxic, you shouldn't be doing this, you shouldn't be doing--
DOLORES: Patrizio, stop it! And Randy, don't you take the bet!
PAT: No, Dad! Dad!
JAKE: Dad!
RANDY: Dolores, would you stop him?
JAKE: Jesus!
PAT: What? No, no, no, no.
RANDY: You're crazy to give away that many points. That's ridiculous! I won't take that! However, wait a second. I do like the idea of a parlay.
DOLORES: What? No parlay! No!
PAT: No, don't do it. Don't do it.
RANDY: Pat, how do they run this dance competition? I mean, how do they score it and everything?
PAT: I don't know, I don't know how they fucking score! We're participating. We're not, we're not a part of it. There are people, this is a high- end dance contest. I don't know. Do not put it as part of the parlay, Randy. Don't--
TIFFANY: They go by the Philadelphia rules. Each dancer is scored on a scale of one to ten, ten being the highest. You have to average the four judges' scores.
RANDY: Okay, score is from one to ten, right? And you guys are how good?
PAT: We suck.
TIFFANY: We don't suck. Pat's a beginner, I'm okay, we're happy just to be going there.
RANDY: And how are the people you're competing against?
TIFFANY: They're good. Some of them are professionals.
RANDY: They're good? Better than you? Pause. Tiffany says nothing.
PAT: A lot better.
RANDY: A lot better. So if I was to say you only have to score five, I would be really very generous, right?
PAT: No, no, that would be amazing if we got five. Let's not get away--
TIFFANY: Oh, come on, we can get a five out of ten! Gimme a break! Gimme me a break!
PAT: We can't get five!
TIFFANY: We can do a five.
PAT: What are you talking about, Dad? You haven't even seen us dance!
RANDY: That's the parlay.
RONNIE: You gotta win two bets or you lose the whole thing. For Pat Sr. to win, the birds gotta beat the Cowboys plus Pat and Tiffany gotta get at least a five at the dance.
RONNIE: That's the parlay.
RANDY: Shake on it.
PAT: You know what? I'm not gonna be a part of this. (to Randy) Randy, Randy, you're a sickness. You're a fucking sickness, Randy. I'm out.
TIFFANY: Pat, you can't quit.
PAT: I'm not doing the dance. I'm out.
TIFFANY: Pat, calm down. Thank about it.
PAT: See you later.
TIFFANY: Pat, no.
TIFFANY: Pat.
(WALKING OUT): I'm out.
(FOLLOWS HIM): Here we are again at the one yard line. DeSean, snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. There you go.
PAT: What does that even mean, Dad? I'm not gonna make that, that, that connection that you're making with DeSean Jackson. It doesn't matter anymore okay? Just because I have the fucking jersey on...I'm not gonna do it. I'm sorry.
TIFFANY: You are not a stand up guy right now. If it's me reading the signs...if it's me reading the
PAT: If it's you reading the signs? You're reading the signs? Oh, okay.
DOLORES: Pat!
TIFFANY: You are not a stand up guy!
DOLORES: Pat!
DOLORES: I told you not to push it.
(SIGHS): You took that stupid parlay thing, and now he won't do the dance and it was very constructive for him, and you ruined it.
TIFFANY: There's only one way to get him to show.
DOLORES: Oh, what's that?
TIFFANY: We have to tell him Nikki's gonna be there. They stare at her.
DOLORES: She won't come. She can't come.
TIFFANY: We have to tell him that she's coming.
DOLORES: But that's a lie!
TIFFANY: It's a white lie.
TIFFANY: There's no other way.
DOLORES: No. I don't approve. You can't do it.
TIFFANY: We're gonna tell him Nikki'll be there.
(TO DOLORES): You gotta be part of it.
TIFFANY: We have to do it.
DOLORES: Aren't you nervous to be lying?
TIFFANY: Yeah. A little bit. But it's for the best.
(READING): "...but if it was me reading the signs...."
DOLORES: Okay.
TIFFANY: Hey.
PAT: Hey, what's up? Sorry I'm late.
TIFFANY: It's fine.
TIFFANY'S MOTHER: Is everything all right?
TIFFANY: This isn't working!
TIFFANY (CONT'D): Stupid!
TIFFANY (CONT'D): This just isn't working!
PAT: Come on, it's gonna be great. Nikki's gonna be there. You know? Everything's gonna come together. It's what's meant to be. You okay?
PAT (CONT'D): Don't get wobbly on me.
TIFFANY: I'm not.
PAT: We have a dance to do. We have a parlay. You gotta stay focused.
TIFFANY: I'm focused.
PAT: Okay, let's go.
PAT: Look at the dancers. You see them?
TIFFANY: Shit.
JAKE: Dallas just tied with another field goal, three-three. I'm worried about the bet.
JAKE: I'm worried about the bet.
DOLORES: Well, you knew that. Maybe you should've scouted `em.
(LAUGHING): Look at those fucking dancers! You can give me the money now, you know?
(TO PAT): Patty, Patty, all we have to do is we have to make a five. That's all. You stay here and watch the game with me.
TIFFANY: The birds are better when Pat is with me. We settled that.
PAT: Relax, we're gonna do fine, okay? I'll see you in a little bit. I'll see you up there, okay?
DANNY: Hey, Pat, Tiffany!
PAT: Hey.
DANNY: What a glorious, beautiful occasion, man.
PAT: Yeah, yeah. All right, buddy, I'll see you. Alright. Wish me luck, man.
PAT: (Notices he and Tiffany are holding hands) Wait, what's this?
TIFFANY: What? I thought you were doing it.
PAT: Oh, I thought you were doing it. We're doing a dance thing anyway, for God's sake.
PAT (CONT'D): You okay?
TIFFANY: I want you to remember everything. I want you to remember all of the good stuff that we have here.
PAT: Of course I do.
TIFFANY: Just check in. I gotta go find Veronica.
PAT: Hi, good evening.
MALE OFFICIAL: Evening.
PAT: Check in? How many dancers are there?
(TO HERSELF): What?! Nikki? Nikki. Oh, Jesus. She seems devastated by Nikki actually being there for Pat.
(TEARFULLY): What the fuck?
VERONICA: Sweetie, sweetie. Honey, calm down.
TIFFANY: You're killing me. You're killing me!
VERONICA: Tiffany, please. She'll see how well he's doing, maybe she'll lift the restraining order.
TIFFANY: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
RONNIE: Pat told me. He told me you should never throw a marriage out the window.
(TEARFULLY): Pat did not say that. He didn't say that.
RONNIE: He said it several times, Tiffany, and this is his chance. You gotta give him a chance.
TIFFANY: Bartender! Bartender, can I get a vodka, please?
TIFFANY: Sure.
TIFFANY (CONT'D): So what do you do?
TIFFANY: Oh, the arguing kind.
(OVER TELEVISION): Three, two, one! Philadelphia beats Dallas! They are on their way to the playoffs.
DANNY: Randy, what the fuck is happening, man?!
(WHISPERING): Where's Tiffany?
PAT: I don't know, Mom. Have you seen her?
DOLORES: You gotta find her.
PAT: I know, Mom, I know.
PAT (CONT'D): Hey, WHAT are you doing?
PAT: She's fine?
PAT: Why don't you shut up, okay?
PAT (CONT'D): How many drinks have you had?
TIFFANY: I've had two vodkas.
PAT: Listen, I don't know what choices you've made, but you gotta deal with it right now, okay? We're in this.
TIFFANY: We're in what?
EMCEE: Next, Pat Solatano and Tiffany Maxwell.
TIFFANY: You know, I used to think that you were the best thing that ever happened to me, but now I think that you might maybe be the worst thing and I'm sorry that I ever met you.
PAT: Good for you. He pulls her out of her chair to go to the stage. TIFFANY AND
EMCEE: And the scores for Makarov and Tretiak are: six point seven, eight point one, seven point five and six point five for an average score of seven point two.
RONNIE: They were great and they only got a seven point two. This is a tough room.
TIFFANY: Got it.
EMCEE: Up next, ladies and gentlemen please welcome Pat Solatano, Jr. and Tiffany Maxwell.
DANNY: Damn.
JAKE: Let's go, Patty!
DANNY: Come on, Pat!
(YELLING): Yeah, Pat! Yeah!
(YELLING): We love you, Pat!
EMCEE: Alright, let's see the scores for Solatano and Maxwell.
EMCEE (CONT'D): We have a four point nine, four eight, a four nine...
FEMALE DANCER: That's really too bad, guys. That's a lot of fours.
EMCEE: ...and and a five point four for an average score of..five point zero.
MALE DANCER: Sorry about that, guys.
(PISSED): What?! Come on! Pat and Tiffany run to Pat Sr., Dolores, everyone. Pat and his father embrace.
PAT: Dad, Dad, did the Eagles win?
RANDY: Come on!
(PUZZLED): Why are they so excited about a five?
EMCEE (CONT'D): We'll take a ten minute break.
TIFFANY: Thank you! You're amazing!
(QUIETLY): Thank you for coming.
NIKKI: Of course.
PAT: How are you? You okay?
NIKKI: Good. How are you?
PAT: I'm really good. Yeah, thanks.
NIKKI: You looked really happy out there.
PAT: Did I?
NIKKI: Yeah.
PAT: Yeah, who'd have thought, dancing? Tiffany reacts from afar, stung.
NIKKI: You look incredible.
PAT: Thank you.
NIKKI: You lost a lot of weight.
PAT: I've been reading your books and, I have a positive attitude. I'm on medication, I'm in therapy.
PAT: Where's Tiffany?
PAT: What do you mean, she left?
PAT: Where is she?
PAT: I love you, Dad.
(YELLING): Hey!
(UPSET): Would you just leave me alone?!
PAT: Wait a second!
PAT (CONT'D): I have one more letter for you to read, okay?
(YELLING): What the fuck is the matter with you? Give it to her yourself!
PAT: Let me say something. You don't ever have to see me again if you just read it, alright?
TIFFANY: This is so fucked up.
PAT: Yeah, just read it.
(READING): "Dear Tiffany... SHE STOPS, surprised it is addressed to her.
(READING): "...I know you wrote the letter. (long pause) The only way you could meet my crazy...."
(RECITING): "...was by doing something crazy yourself. Thank you. I love you. I knew it the minute I met you. I'm sorry it took so long for me to catch up. I just got stuck. Pat." I wrote that a week ago.
TIFFANY: You wrote that a week ago?
PAT: Yes, I did.
TIFFANY: You let me lie to you for a week?
PAT: I was trying to be romantic.
TIFFANY: You love me?
PAT: Yeah, I do.
TIFFANY: Okay. SHE LEANS FORWARD AND KISSES HIM, they kiss. Camera pulls away. Score comes in.
(VOICE OVER): The world will break your heart ten ways to Sunday, that's guaranteed. And I can't begin to explain that-
(VOICE OVER): -or the craziness inside myself and everybody else, but guess what? Sunday is my favorite day again. I think of everything everyone did for me and I feel like --a very lucky guy.
RANDY: I'd like to do another parlay if we make it to the next round, that's all.
RONNIE: No, that was me that did that.
JAKE: No that was me.
RONNIE: That was me. I played the Jack.
DANNY: So you put the bread crumbs, the garlic in the steak and you roll it up with the toothpicks?
DOLORES: Yeah. For, oh, maybe three hours, plus.
(INTO TELEPHONE): Everything's good, everything's good, yeah. I got you, you're all down. (pause) No, Randy, he's complaining. You know he lost a lot of money. He's moaning and groaning. The restaurant's happening because of Randy, so everything's good. TIFFANY SITS DOWN ON PAT'S LAP AND THEY TALK (we cannot hear them) and KISS.
