SHREK: Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever gonna happen. What a load of - (toilet flush)
MAN1: Think it's in there?
MAN2: All right. Let's get it!
MAN1: Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you?
SHREK: Yes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin.
SHREK: They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast.
GUARD: (taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half)
HEAD GUARD: Twenty pieces.
LITTLE BEAR: (crying) This cage is too small.
DONKEY: Please, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance!
DONKEY: Oh!
HEAD GUARD: Next! What have you got?
GIPETTO: This little wooden puppet.
PINOCCHIO: I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows)
OLD WOMAN: Well, I've got a talking donkey.
HEAD GUARD: Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it.
HEAD GUARD: Well?
OLD WOMAN: Oh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. Talk, you boneheaded dolt...
OLD WOMAN: No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk! The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled with fairy dust and he's able to fly.
PETER PAN: He can fly!
3 LITTLE PIGS: He can fly!
HEAD GUARD: He can talk!
DONKEY: Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink to the ground.)
HEAD GUARD: Seize him! (Donkey takes of running.) After him!
SHREK: Aye?
HEAD GUARD: By the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility.
DONKEY: Man, it's good to be free.
SHREK: Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm?
DONKEY: I'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith...
SHREK: Really?
DONKEY: Really, really.
SHREK: Oh.
DONKEY: Man, I like you. What's you name?
SHREK: Uh, Shrek.
DONKEY: Shrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that?
DONKEY: Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. I guess you don't entertain much, do you?
DONKEY: You know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. (awkward silence) Can I stay with you?
DONKEY: Can I stay with you, please?
SHREK: (sarcastically) Of course!
DONKEY: Really?
SHREK: No.
DONKEY: Please! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (pause while he looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!
DONKEY: Ah! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage)
DONKEY: Where do, uh, I sleep?
SHREK: (irritated) Outside!
DONKEY: Oh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...
GORDO: Blah! Awful stuff.
BLIND MOUSE1: Is that you, Gordo?
GORDO: How did you know?
SHREK: Enough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table.
TIME LAPSE: Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging him to the front door.
SHREK: What?
PINOCCHIO: We were forced to come here.
SHREK: (flabbergasted) By who?
LITTLE PIG: Lord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice.
DONKEY: Oh, I do. I know where he is.
SHREK: Does anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all?
SHREK: Anyone?
DONKEY: Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me!
DONKEY: Can I whistle?
SHREK: No.
DONKEY: Can I hum it?
SHREK: All right, hum it. Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'.
DULOC - KITCHEN: A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in.
FARQUAAD: I'm not the monster here. You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell me! Where are the others?
GINGERBREAD MAN: The muffin man.
FARQUAAD: Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane?
GINGERBREAD MAN: The muffin man!
FARQUAAD: She's married to the muffin man. The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.
HEAD GUARD: My lord! We found it.
FARQUAAD: Then what are you waiting for? Bring it in.
FARQUAAD: Magic mirror...
GINGERBREAD MAN: Don't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No!
MIRROR: (chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are! Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows picture of Snow White) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes pina colads and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows picture of Princess Fiona) So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three?
THELONIUS: Three! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord!
MIRROR: Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona.
MIRROR: Yes, but after sunset...
FARQUAAD: Silence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)
SHREK: Do you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.)
MAN: Hurry, darling. We're late. Hurry.
SHREK: It's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody?
DONKEY: Wow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again)
FARQUAAD: Brave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...
FARQUAAD: That champion shall have the honor - - no, no - - the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? It's hideous!
SHREK: Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer)
SHREK: (holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint?
SHREK: No? All right then. (drinks the beer) Come on!
FARQUAAD: No, I have a better idea. People of DuLoc, I give you our champion!
FARQUAAD: Congratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest.
SHREK: Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures!
FARQUAAD: Down to the last slime-covered toadstool.
FARQUAAD: As good as gone.
SHREK: What kind of quest? Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion.
SHREK: For your information, there's a lot more to ogres than people think.
SHREK: Example? Okay, um, ogres are like onions. (he holds out his onion)
SHREK: Yes - - No!
DONKEY: They make you cry?
SHREK: No!
DONKEY: You leave them in the sun, they get all brown, start sproutin' little white hairs.
DONKEY: Well, I have a bit of a confession to make. Donkeys don't have layers. We wear our fear right out there on our sleeves.
SHREK: You can't tell me you're afraid of heights.
SHREK: Really, really.
DONKEY: Okay, that makes me feel so much better.
DONKEY: But I know that half is safe!
SHREK: Okay, fine. I don't have time for this. You go back.
SHREK: Just, Donkey - - Let's have a dance then, shall me? (bounces and sways the bridge)
SHREK: Oh, I'm sorry. Do what? Oh, this? (bounces the bridge again)
SHREK: Yes? Yes, do it. Okay. (continues to bounce and sway as he backs Donkey across the bridge)
SHREK: You said do it! I'm doin' it.
DONKEY: I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, I'm gonna die. (steps onto solid ground) Oh!
DONKEY: You afraid?
SHREK: No.
DONKEY: But...
SHREK: Shh.
DONKEY: Oh, good. Me neither. (sees a skeleton and gasps) 'Cause there's nothin' wrong with bein' afraid. Fear's a sensible response to an unfamiliar situation. Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I might add. With a dragon that breathes fire and eats knights and breathes fire, it sure doesn't mean you're a coward if you're a little scared. I sure as heck ain't no coward. I know that.
SHREK: Well, at least we know where the princess is, but where's the...
SHREK: Wake up!
FIONA: What?
SHREK: Are you Princess Fiona?
FIONA: I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me.
FIONA: But wait, Sir Knight. This be-ith our first meeting. Should it not be a wonderful, romantic moment?
FIONA: Can I at least know the name of my champion?
FIONA: Sir Shrek. (clears throat and holds out a handkerchief) I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude.
FIONA: (surprised)You didn't slay the dragon?
FIONA: What kind of knight are you?
SHREK: One of a kind. (opens the door into the throne room)
FIONA: It talks!
SHREK: Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's the trick.
FIONA: Why not?
SHREK: I have helmet hair.
FIONA: Please. I would'st look upon the face of my rescuer.
FIONA: But how will you kiss me?
SHREK: What? (to Donkey) That wasn't in the job description.
FIONA: No, it's destiny. Oh, you must know how it goes. A princess locked in a tower and beset by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight, and then they share true love's first kiss.
DONKEY: You think Shrek is your true love!
SHREK: Let's just say I'm not your type, okay?Fiona: Of course, you are. You're my rescuer. Now - - Now remove your helmet.
SHREK: I'm not going to.
FIONA: Take it off.
SHREK: No!
FIONA: Now!
SHREK: Okay! Easy. As you command. Your Highness. (takes off his helmet)
SHREK: Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.
SHREK: You're not making my job any easier.
SHREK: Ya comin', Donkey?
DONKEY: I'm right behind ya.
FIONA: Put me down, or you will suffer the consequences! This is not dignified! Put me down!
DONKEY: Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camp is starting to sound good.
DONKEY: Shrek, we can do better than that. I don't think this is fit for a princess.
SHREK: (laughs) I just- - You know - - Oh, come on. I was just kidding.
SHREK: No, look. There he is, and there's the group of hunters running away from his stench.
DONKEY: You know, when we're through rescuing the princess.
DONKEY: Are you hidin' something?
SHREK: Never mind, Donkey.
DONKEY: Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn't it?
DONKEY: Why are you blocking?
SHREK: I'm not blocking.
DONKEY: Oh, yes, you are.
SHREK: Donkey, I'm warning you.
DONKEY: Who you trying to keep out?
SHREK: Everyone! Okay?
DONKEY: (pause) Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere. (grins)
DONKEY: So, uh, are there any donkeys up there?
SHREK: That's the moon.
DONKEY: Oh, okay. DuLoc - Farquaad's Bedroom The camera pans over a lot of wedding stuff. Soft music plays in the background. Farquaad is in bed, watching as the Magic Mirror shows him Princess Fiona.
DONKEY: Huh? What?
SHREK: Wake up.
DONKEY: What? (stretches and yawns)
FIONA: Good morning. Hm, how do you like your eggs?
SHREK: What's all this about?
FIONA: You know, we kind of got off to a bad start yesterday. I wanted to make it up to you. I mean, after all, you did rescue me.
FIONA: Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead of us. (walks off)
SHREK: What? It's a compliment. Better out than in, I always say. (laughs)
FIONA: Thanks.
DONKEY: She's as nasty as you are.
SHREK: (chuckles) You know, you're not exactly what I expected.
SHREK: Princess!
FIONA: (to Robin Hood) What are you doing?
ROBIN HOOD: I steal from the rich and give to the needy.
ROBIN HOOD: But I'm not greedy. I rescue pretty damsels, man, I'm good.
ROBIN HOOD: Break it down. I like an honest fight and a saucy little maid...
ROBIN HOOD: When a beauty's with a beast it makes me awfully mad.
MERRY MAN: Oh, you little- - (shoots an arrow at Fiona but she ducks out of the way)
SHREK: Hold the phone. (drops Donkey and begins walking after Fiona) Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on now. Where did that come from?
SHREK: That! Back there. That was amazing! Where did you learn that?
FIONA: Shrek's hurt.
DONKEY: Shrek's hurt. Shrek's hurt? Oh, no, Shrek's gonna die.
DONKEY: You can't do this to me, Shrek. I'm too young for you to die. Keep you legs elevated. Turn your head and cough. Does anyone know the Heimlich?
DONKEY: Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns. (runs off)
FIONA: (like it's obvious) For getting rid of Donkey.
FIONA: Now you hold still, and I'll yank this thing out. (gives the arrow a little pull)
FIONA: Now, hold on.
SHREK: What you're doing is the opposite of help.
SHREK: Look, time out.
FIONA: Would you...(grunts as Shrek puts his hand over her face to stop her from getting at the arrow) Okay. What do you propose we do?
DONKEY: Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. This would be so much easier if I wasn't color-blind! Blue flower, red thorns.
DONKEY: Hold on, Shrek! I'm comin'! (rips a flower off a nearby bush that just happens to be a blue flower with red thorns)
SHREK: Ow! Not good.
FIONA: Okay. Okay. I can nearly see the head. (Shrek grunts as she pulls) It's just about...
SHREK: (throwing Fiona off of him) Nothing happend. We were just, uh - -
SHREK: There it is, Princess. Your future awaits you.
DONKEY: Yeah, I know. You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's compensating for something, which I think means he has a really...(Shrek steps on his hoof) Ow!
FIONA: I mean, look at him. He doesn't look so good.
DONKEY: Hey, where you goin'? Oh, man, I can't feel my toes! (looks down and yelps) I don't have any toes! I think I need a hug.
FIONA: No kidding. Well, this is delicious.
FIONA: I guess I'll be dining a little differently tomorrow night.
SHREK: Um, Princess?
FIONA: Yes, Shrek?
SHREK: I, um, I was wondering...are you...(sighs) Are you gonna eat that?
DONKEY: Wait a minute. I see what's goin' on here. You're afraid of the dark, aren't you?
FIONA: Good night.
SHREK: Good night. Fiona goes inside the windmill and closes the door. Donkey looks at Shrek with a new eye.
DONKEY: I don't even wanna hear it. Look, I'm an animal, and I got instincts. And I know you two were diggin' on each other. I could feel it.
- -: An ogre?
SHREK: Yeah. An ogre.
DONKEY: Hey, where you goin'?
SHREK: To get... move firewood. (sighs) Donkey looks over at the large pile of firewood there already is.
FIONA: Oh, no!
DONKEY: No, help!
FIONA: Shh!
DONKEY: Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
FIONA: No, it's okay. It's okay.
DONKEY: What did you do with the princess?
DONKEY: Aah!
FIONA: It's me, in this body.
DONKEY: Oh, my God! You ate the princess. (to her stomach) Can you hear me?
DONKEY: (still aimed at her stomach) Listen, keep breathing! I'll get you out of there!
DONKEY: Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
FIONA: Shh.
DONKEY: Shrek!
FIONA: This is me. Donkey looks into her eyes as she pets his muzzle, and he quiets down.
DONKEY: Well, yeah! Was it something you ate? 'Cause I told Shrek those rats was a bad idea. You are what you eat, I said. Now - -
OUTSIDE: Shrek is walking towards the windmill with a sunflower in his hand.
FIONA: (os) My only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love.
FIONA: Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how it has to be. It's the only way to break the spell.
DONKEY: All right, all right. I won't tell him. But you should. (goes outside) I just know before this is over, I'm gonna need a whole lot of serious therapy. Look at my eye twitchin'.
SHREK: Perfect! Never been better.
FIONA: I - - I don't - - There's something I have to tell you.
SHREK: Every word.
FIONA: I thought you'd understand.
SHREK: Oh, I understand. Like you said, "Who could love a hideous, ugly beast?"
SHREK: As promised. Now hand it over.
FARQUAAD: Very well, ogre. (holds out a piece of paper) The deed to your swamp, cleared out, as agreed. Take it and go before I change my mind. (Shrek takes the paper) Forgive me, Princess, for startling you, but you startled me, for I have never seen such a radiant beauty before. I'm Lord Farquaad.
DONKEY: Shrek, there's something about her you don't know. Look, I talked to her last night, She's - -
SHREK: I told you, didn't I? You're not coming home with me. I live alone! My swamp! Me! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody! Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys!
SHREK: Yeah. You know what? You thought wrong! (stomps off)
DONKEY: Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess. I did half the work. I get half the booty. Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks like your head.
DONKEY: No, you back off.
SHREK: This is my swamp!
DONKEY: Our swamp.
SHREK: (grabs the tree branch Donkey is working with) Let go, Donkey!
SHREK: Stubborn jackass!
DONKEY: Smelly ogre.
SHREK: Fine! (drops the tree branch and walks away)
DONKEY: Uh-uh. You know, with you it's always, "Me, me, me!" Well, guess what! Now it's my turn! So you just shut up and pay attention! You are mean to me. You insult me and you don't appreciate anything that I do! You're always pushing me around or pushing me away.
DONKEY: There you are , doing it again just like you did to Fiona. All she ever do was like you, maybe even love you.
DONKEY: No!
SHREK: Okay, look. I'm sorry, all right? (sigh) I'm sorry. I guess I am just a big, stupid, ugly ogre. Can you forgive me?
DONKEY: Friends.
SHREK: So, um, what did Fiona say about me?
DONKEY: I guess it's just my animal magnetism.
SHREK: Aw, come here, you. (gives Donkey a noogie)
DULOC - CHURCH: Fiona and Farquaad are getting married. The whole town is there. The prompter card guy holds up a card that says 'Revered Silence'.
PRIEST: ...of our new king...
FIONA: Excuse me. Could we just skip ahead to the "I do's"?
DONKEY: Hey, wait. What are you doing? Listen to me! Look, you love this woman, don't you?
DONKEY: You wanna hold her?
SHREK: Yes.
DONKEY: Please her?
SHREK: Yes!
DONKEY: (singing James Brown style) Then you got to, got to try a little tenderness. (normal) The chicks love that romantic crap!
INSIDE CHURCH: As the priest talks we see Donkey's shadow through one of the windows Shrek tosses him up so he can see.
SHREK: What do you see?
DONKEY: The whole town's in there. Inside
PRIEST: I now pronounce you husband and wife...
DONKEY: They're at the altar. Inside
PRIEST: ...king and queen. Outside
DONKEY: Mother Fletcher! He already said it.
SHREK: (running toward the alter) I object!
FARQUAAD: Oh, now what does he want?
SHREK: (to congregation as he reaches the front of the Church) Hi, everyone. Havin' a good time, are ya? I love DuLoc, first of all. Very clean.
SHREK: Really, it's rude enough being alive when no one wants you, but showing up uninvited to a wedding...
FIONA: Oh, now you wanna talk? It's a little late for that, so if you'll excuse me
- -: But you can't marry him.
FIONA: And why not?
SHREK: Because- - Because he's just marring you so he can be king.
FIONA: And what do you know about true love?
FARQUAAD: Oh, this is precious. The ogee has fallen in love with the princess! Oh, good Lord. (laughs)
FIONA: Shrek, is this true?
FARQUAAD: Who cares? It's preposterous! Fiona, my love, we're but a kiss away from our "happily ever after." Now kiss me! (puckers his lips and leans toward her, but she pulls back.)
FIONA: Shrek!
FARQUAAD: This hocus-pocus alters nothing. This marriage is binding, and that makes me king! See? See?
SHREK: No!
FARQUAAD: Don't just stand there, you morons.
FARQUAAD: I'll make you regret the day we met. I'll see you drawn and quartered! You'll beg for death to save you!
FARQUAAD: (hold a dagger to Fiona's throat) And as for you, my wife...
FARQUAAD: I'll have you locked back in that tower for the rest of your days! I'm king!
FARQUAAD: I will have order! I will have perfection! I will have - - (Donkey and the dragon show up and the dragon leans down and eats Farquaad) Aaaah! Aah!
DONKEY: Go ahead, Shrek.
SHREK: Uh, Fiona?
FIONA: Yes, Shrek?
SHREK: I - - I love you.
FIONA: Really?
SHREK: Really, really.
FIONA: (smiles) I love you too. Shrek and Fiona kiss. Thelonius takes one of the cards and writes 'Awwww' on the back and then shows it to the congregation.
DONKEY: (chuckles) I was hoping this would be a happy ending.
THE SWAMP: ...their wedding kiss. Shrek and Fiona are now married. 'I'm a Believer' by Smashmouth is played in the background. Shrek and Fiona break apart and run through the crowd to their awaiting carriage. Which is made of a giant onion. Fiona tosses her bouquet which both Cinderella and Snow White try to catch. But they end up getting into a cat fight and so the dragon catches the bouquet instead. The Gingerbread man has been mended somewhat and now has one leg and walks with a candy cane cane. Shrek and Fiona walk off as the rest of the guests party and Donkey takes over singing the song.
DONKEY: (as he's done singing and we fade to black) Oh, that's funny. Oh. Oh. I can't breathe. I can't breathe.
