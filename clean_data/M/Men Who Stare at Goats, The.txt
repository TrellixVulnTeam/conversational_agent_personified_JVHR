SUPERED TITLES READ:: More of this is true than you would believe.
(SOLEMNLY): Boone?
GENERAL PUTKIN: I'm going into the next office.
MINDS...: His audience stare at him. With a flourish he produces a BENT FORK from his briefcase.
(SADLY): Look at me. So young. "The past is a different country. They...do things there." We PAN to the next desk and Bob's over-weight colleague RON, who sits eating a hot-dog.
DETERMINATION: American troops pull down a huge statue of Saddam Hussein in central Baghdad. An American flag draped over the head is hastily replaced by an Iraqi flag.
(STUNG): Well, I think it's important people get an accurate picture of what's...
(LISTENING): ...what's, uh, happening, so...is that Dave?
(EMBARRASSED): I've been stuck here. They've only just given me the green-light. So I'll probably head over there soon. I'm just working on this story about American contractors coming over for the re-build. The Journalists look bored.
EMBEDDED: you form a bond with the soldiers. You're like one of them.
JOURNALIST): You see action?
(SHYLY): Hey.
(BEAT): Right. We make trash cans.
(SHAKING): Skip.
(SUDDENLY): Lyn Cassady...?
(BEAT): You mean, what...with your...?
(BEAT): Huh. What kind of animals?
TV): Bizarre. Right?
(SHEEPISH): Yeah well...(He gestures to his Mother) Mother said no. She said you might be a bleeding-heart liberal. She said "Don't show him the hamster dying. Show him the tape where the hamster acts bizarre instead." Bob looks to Gus' Mother who manages to look nervous and defiant at the same time. Gus stares at the blank TV, sips his coffee.
ON LYN'S NAME TAG: Bob straightens from lighting his cigarette, stares at Lyn.
DISGUST): Did he show you his "Home Study Course"?
CORRIDOR): Yeah I bet he did.
(RUEFULLY): He is an idiot...or he was...he's dead now. He was a paranormal whore. Always trying to get into the spotlight, yak, yak yaking. We took an oath. We don't divulge...
(BEAT): Uh...?
(BEAT): What's a Jedi Warrior?
(PATIENTLY): I'm Sergeant First Class Lyn Cassady, Special Forces, retired. In the eighties I was trained at Fort Bragg in a secret initiative code-named Project Jedi. The objective of the project was to create Super Soldiers.
(BEAT): You've got super powers?
(WRITING): What other powers did you practise?
(SUDDENLY): I could come.
(BEAT): What?
(BEAT): Nothing. He considers for a moment, struggling with himself, then seems to reluctantly come to a decision. He reaches into the bag on his bed and pulls out a dog-eared BOOK. He hands it to Bob. Bob examines the book - on the cover is a picture of Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man and the title Pentagon Report 92245. The New Earth Army Manual. Bob stares at the book. He opens the first page and reads...
(READING): The U.S Army doesn't really have any serious alternative than to be Wonderful! Bob looks at the DISCLAIMER at the bottom of the page.
(READING): This does not represent the official position of the United States Army at this time. Bob looks up at Lyn who nods gravely.
(READING): The New Earth Army is a banner under which the forces of good can gather. The courage and nobility of the Warrior, blended with the spirituality of the Monk.
(READING): The role of The New Earth Army is to RESOLVE CONFLICT world-wide. Jedis will parachute into war zones, utilizing sparkly eyes technique, carrying symbolic flowers and animals, playing indigenous music and words of peace... INSERT: An illustration of a SOLDIER CARRYING A LAMB and some LILIES - with what appears to be some kind of loudspeaker strapped to his shoulder.
SILENCE.: Everyone stares at the dead man. Another shot rings out - another SOLDIER DROPS. The others flinch, scan the tree- line ahead of them.
(POINTING): VC in black pyjamas! One hundred meters! It's a woman! The WOMAN is jogging across the tree-line ahead, weapon in hand.
HAND): Okay! Silence. Long pause.
TAKE HER OUT!: The Soldiers open fire - a deafening roar. The Woman keeps on running as the foliage above her head is shredded by bullets. NO SHOT COMES CLOSE. Bill watches amazed.
(SOFTLY): Their gentleness is their strength. We begin to sink back down again, faster and faster until the circle of white light has disappeared all together and we are in DARKNESS...
MILLER.: Bill senses someone staring at him and glances over to the Meditator next to him - Aviator shades, a baseball cap pulled low, empty cigarette holder clenched between his teeth. The Meditator continues to stare intently at him. Then opens his coat to reveal the Magnum .45 strapped to his chest. Bill smiles nervously. An ARROW identifies the gunman as
(BEAT): Does it direct your powers?
(LAUGHS): The Predator? (Beat) That's a plastic blob, Lyn. (Pointing at the blob) That's a... Before he can finish Lyn has slipped Bob's finger into a hole in the middle of the blob and twisted it.
(MUTTERING): Piece'a shit.
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE: ee. They finish. Bill nods, smiling, stares around at them.
(BEAT): What attempt?
(SOFTLY): Lyn?
(POINTING): That one. Bob tries to work out which cloud he means.
(CHECKING): Right. He tosses again.
(CHECKING): Right. That's pretty... He stops, listening. We hear the sound of an approaching ENGINE. The two men turn to see a WHITE PICK-UP TRUCK approaching.
FEET): Oh thank Christ. Bob scuttles into the middle of the road, waving frantically. The pick-up slows and pulls over. A YOUNG IRAQI MAN looks out at them.
(RELAXING): Thank you! Thanks so much! He grabs his case and climbs up onto the back of the truck. Lyn stares at the driver, then, with a sigh picks up his bag and follows Bob.
(LAUGHING): Don't know if we would have lasted much longer. Phew! One of the Young Men nods, smiling. He reaches casually forward and takes Lyn's BAG from him. Lyn just sits there, resigned as the Young Man roots through the contents.
(OBLIVIOUS): Yeah, it gets pretty hot out here, huh? The Young Man takes out a ROCK COMPILATION CD from Lyn's bag and inspects it.
(WEARILY): Yeah.
(MUFFLED): You're an idiot. You want to know why I'm with you? Because I got drunk. (Starting to cry a little) I got drunk and I just wanted to get into Iraq so I could prove to my wife I wasn't...just once that I...And now I'm going to die. She's right. I'm such a... He dissolves into misery. Lyn watches with sympathy.
(BEAT): What do you mean?
(SIGHS): You're missing the point. (Standing up) Here let me show you something. Stand up. Bob stands up reluctantly.
(BEAT): Well, if I choose to choke you, what are you going to do?
(PLEASED): You know why? It wasn't you. It was me. I was inside your head. Fighting with the Mind. Suddenly the door opens and one of the Young Iraqis comes in, smiling.
(SOFTLY): I'm sorry I freaked out, Lyn.
(IMPRESSED): Huh.
(BEAT): Gus Lacey said you ran a dance studio. That was just cover too, right?
(BEAT): Were you just kidding me back there - about me having some Jedi in me?
MICROPHONE): Foxtrot-117 has launched. Tracking now. Charlie-Oscar 31.8066667... Lyn (30's), in uniform, walks past and both computers
(MISERABLE): Yes sir. Beat. A SLOW GRIN steals over the General's face.
(SOFTLY): Far fucking out... Lyn blinks. This wasn't the reaction he'd expected.
(CHUCKLING): Yeah, I'm only kidding with that shit. Okay, what shall we do now? He stares around the men, expectantly.
(EMBARRASSED): Not much of a dancer sir. Bill examines Lyn's face through narrowed eyes.
(CALMLY): Okay, you're doing very well. Now feel the next bend...
(ENCOURAGING): Think cold! Think real cold!
A-9.: The three men focus on the cupboard in question.
(BLUSTERING): Oh, no, wait. See, I thought you said K, not A! Bill ignores him, smiles at Lyn.
LATER: Larry flails violently at Lyn. Lyn FLIPS him with ease. Larry gets up and CHARGES bellowing at Lyn who FLIPS him out of the frame. Bill joins Lyn.
HIM): Larry, go outside, calm down.
(CONCENTRATING): We're north of Verona. It's a little town. There's a lake nearby. I can see a Cinema. Across from the Cinema is a shop or, or...it's a cafe. He's in the apartment above. The town is called...it's something sweet. (Beat) Dolce. It's called Dolce. Bill looks proudly over to where an important looking OFFICIAL watches from the next room. The Official looks impressed.
(GENTLY): It's okay, Bob. We're not getting into that truck. The First Young Iraqi gestures more angrily at the Truck.
EDKHOL!: Lyn raises one hand towards him.
(FIRMLY): Stay where you are Bob. Bob stops.
CALMLY): We can go about our business. Apparently having had enough one the Insurgents pulls his own GUN out and aims at Lyn. The tension builds. Suddenly Bob remembers the phrase he was taught.
(BLURTING): La termi, ana sahafi!
REVERSE: SHOOTING from behind Ben to the rows of JEDI RECRUITS watching with expressions of mingled admiration and horror.
INSIDE THE TRUCK: Lyn drives. Bob is leaning out of the window, staring at the road behind them.
ENGINE): Sir? You're okay! We're Americans. We're here to help you! Terrified the Man sprints faster. Lyn tries to pass him, but the Man veers at the same time and the truck CLIPS him, sending him flying.
(BRAKING): I think I just ran him over.
LAPTOP SCREEN: We're rushing over a CGI DESERT, between the CGI rivers Tigress and Euphrates towards a GLEAMING CITY rising from the sand.
(SHAKING): Mahmud Daash.
(WEAKLY): Mahmud. What business are you in sir?
(LAUGHING): Yeah, okay...watch the wheel Phil. (To Bob) Year Zero boys. Bob nods politely.
THE BACK SEAT: Lyn prepares an INJECTION for himself. He feels the Security Guard beside him watching. He notices the name of the company on the man's badge - Krom Security.
(INTERESTED): Really? Is that Norse?
(SUDDENLY): Okay. We're in Indian Country. Check six. The SUV's are approaching a town and other cars have appeared on the road. The Security Men on either side instantly lean out of their windows with their M-16's - aiming them at the cars which swerve out of their way in fear.
THOSE: roofs. Behind him the sound of CARS BRAKING AND SWERVING continues.
(YELLING): Contact! We've got contact! He opens FIRE - IMMEDIATE CHAOS: people scream, duck down, some cars reverse desperately and collide with the cars behind. The other Security Men join in the shooting.
(SHOOTING): Where? Where's the shooter?
INSIDE THE SUV: A scowling Nixon has slid low in his seat.
(BEAT): And I apologize for that security detachment. Please don't think all Americans are like that. Mahmud nods. Beat.
(CAREFULLY): Akhir il ahzan. (May this be the last of your sorrows.) Mahmud looks at him, startled perhaps by the unexpected Arabic phrase.
(FIRMLY): Ask Angela Lansbury.
(BEAT): What's that Tim?
(GENTLY): Norm? Give me the gun, Norm. Norm starts to cry. Then he puts the gun into his mouth...
(PEEVISH): Jesus Christ. We could'a bought a map if you'd said.
(EXASPERATED): Well...use your watch.
(BEAT): What?
AN HOUR! HOW'S THAT "INSTANT?": Lyn abruptly starts the engine and takes the right turn.
(GRIMLY): Yes. It's this way.
(CROAKING): What...what happened? Lyn is staggering over the sand with Bob on his back. He is holding his backpack. Bob has a gash on his forehead which is bleeding. Under the blood his face is white. In the distance, behind them, we can see the column of black smoke rising.
(BEAT): What?
(PATIENTLY): You're going to be okay.
(BEAT): I don't know.
(SOFTLY): Oh...Oh Jesus.
SADNESS): They took this... beautiful thing we'd been building and they corrupted it. They destroyed the New Earth Army.
(MUTTERING): I bet he wasn't. He takes the report and begins to look through it. Pause. He looks up slowly at Larry.
(SOFTLY): Holy shit. Beat. The goat gets back up, shakes itself and walks off. Lyn slumps.
(SADLY): Goat didn't have a chance.
CLOSE ON LYN: ...as he stares, concentrating.
VIDEO FOOTAGE: Grainy, flickering black and white footage of the six goats in the room. Suddenly one of them goes down.
(SOLEMNLY): The goat is dead. The three men stare at him.
(HOARSELY): Goat number four?
(SURPRISED): No. Number five.
SUBTITLED): In America if I do not like my cell-phone company I change them. I am in charge. This is consumer power.
(HISSING): Lyn? Where are you going?
INSIDE THE BUILDING: The place is full of GOATS. Lyn and Bob stare at the animals. Slowly Lyn advances into the darkness, peering around him. In the shadows at the back of the building a figure STIRS. Lyn walks slowly forward until he can make out the man - old, bearded, worn and wasted by years of heavy drinking. It's BILL DJANGO. Lyn stares at him.
(CHOKED): Hello Bill. Bill smiles hesitantly.
(CHUCKLING): Psy for psychological, although the irony isn't wasted on me. Radio broadcasts, leaflets, that sort of thing. Bob picks up a LEAFLET.
(READING): "American Soldier - your wives are back home having sex with Bart Simpson and Bert Reynolds."
LYN'S P.O.V -: An IRAQI PRISONER sits huddled in the cell, illuminated in the flashes of a powerful STROBE LIGHT OVERHEAD.
(ANXIOUSLY): What? What is it?
(BEAT): It isn't real.
(ANGRILY): That isn't true. That isn't true. He looks around for inspiration - notices a LONE CLOUD floating in the sky. Bob places his fingers on his temples and STARES at the cloud, focuses, desperate, hopeful... Bill notices and watches, curious. Slowly, the cloud fades and DISAPPEARS.
(BEAT): Just tired.
(SMILING): Scotty Mercer told you, didn't he?
(BEAT): Don't make a decision now. Tell me in the morning. He pats Lyn's leg, walks out.
(BEAT): Timothy Leary's dead.
(SALUTING): Good evening sir.
(MUMBLING): Getting some ice-cream. They walk on and reach the doors to the KITCHENS. The two men hesitate, look at each other... Then Bob walks in.
(SOFTLY): Don't eat the jello. Lyn turns to Bob puzzled.
(BEAT): What?
(SUDDENLY): And in the water. Bob turns to stare at him.
(THOUGHTFULLY): Yeah. He pours himself another coffee.
ALL OVER THE BASE: Soldiers are wandering around, talking, some falling to their knees, weak with laughter. Some stand alone, staring with a beatific smile at the sky.
(CALMLY): It's okay. You missed them.
(ANGRY): Don't you think it might have been more sensible if we hadn't drunk the fucking water?
(SOFTLY): Give me the gun Larry. Larry starts to raise the gun to his mouth. Pauses. Scratches his head.
LAUGHING): Hey! More music! (muffled) Get off, will ya? Over the loud-speakers we hear the opening of a period song.
(WAVING): That's it. Keep going. Ma'assalama. The Iraqis start to hurry away over the sand. Beyond them we can the Stryker, driving in circles in the desert, a NAKED SOLDIER stands whooping on top.
(CALLING): Wait! Wait for me! Where are you going...what about the mission?
(CHUCKLING): And finally, US forces in Iraq are using what some are calling a cruel and unusual tool to break the resistance of Iraqi POWs, and many parents would agree! Some prisoners are being forced to listen to Barney the Purple Dinosaur sing the I Love You song. I think after an hour of that they'll spill the beans! Don't you? Let's go outside to Al for the weather.
