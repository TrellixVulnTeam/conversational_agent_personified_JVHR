"RED DRAGON": Screenplay By Michael Mann
SECOND DRAFT: July 20, 1984
CRAWFORD: I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here...
GRAHAM: I don't want to talk about it anywhere. (beat) If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.
CRAWFORD: How much do you know?
GRAHAM: What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.' (beat) Confessions?
CRAWFORD: Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces. (beat) None of them knew that;
GRAHAM: What else did you keep out of the papers?
CRAWFORD: Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive.
GRAHAM: Somebody hurt him?
CRAWFORD: Typed him from semen. He's a secretor.
CRAWFORD: Will... you saw this in the papers. The second one was all over TV. Did you ever think about givin' me a call?
GRAHAM: No.
CRAWFORD: Why not?
GRAHAM: The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago...
CRAWFORD: And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
GRAHAM: You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
CRAWFORD: Last two like this we had, you caught.
GRAHAM: That was three years ago. And by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing.
CRAWFORD: That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think.
GRAHAM: I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think. (beat) I came down here to get away from all that.
CRAWFORD: You look all right now.
GRAHAM: I am all right.
GRAHAM: As long as they're dead...
CRAWFORD: These are all dead, Will.
GRAHAM (O.S.): Let's talk after dinner. Stay and eat.
CRAWFORD (O.S.): I'LL come back later. I got messages at the Holiday Inn to collect
MOLLY: He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here.
GRAHAM: What did he want?
GRAHAM: And you said?
MOLLY: I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
GRAHAM: I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma? (sarcastic) I got a diploma and everything.
MOLLY: You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma. (heat) You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...
GRAHAM: We have it good, don't we?
MOLLY: All the things that happened to you before make you know that...
GRAHAM: What the hell can I do?
MOLLY: (after a pause) What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
GRAHAM: If I were?
MOLLY: (facing him) Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me. And Kevin. (heat) That's selfish, huh?
GRAHAM: (touches the side of her face) I don't care. (beat> He'll never see me or know my name. If we find him, the police will have to take him down. Not me, I'm just looking at evidence.
KEVIN: Will it keep them out?
GRAHAM: Yeah. ..
KEVIN: How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
GRAHAM: In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
KEVIN: Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?
GRAHAM: Yeah, but not now.. These will all make it... guaranteed.
MOLLY: Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?
CRAWFORD: I have to.
MOLLY: You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
CRAWFORD: Because it's his bad luck to be special.
MOLLY: He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
CRAWFORD: Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...
MOLLY: You wouldn't like it, either if you had it.
CRAWFORD: Talking about 'like,' you don't like me very much, do you?
MOLLY: No. (beat) I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
CRAWFROD: I'LL try to keep him as far away from it as I can...
GRAHAM: (distant) Thanks for the lift.
OFFICER: I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.
GRAHAM: That's right.
OFFTCER: There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for They transferred the home movies of both families once half-inch VHS.
GRAHAM: intruder entered through kitchen sliding door. Probably a glass cutter. Why didn't he care that he left AB saliva on the glass? it was hot out that night. inside, the house must' have been pleasantly cool to him. (beat) The intruder cut Charles Leeds' throat as he lay asleep beside Mrs. Leeds. He shot Mrs. Leeds as she was rising... Bullet entered the right of her navel and lodged in her lumbar spine, but she died of strangulation... increase of serotonin and free histimine levels in the gunshot wound indicates... she lived at least five minutes after she was shot... All her other injuries were post-mortem. (beat> Then he went toward the children's room. (beat) Direction and velocity of blood stains on the east wall indicate arterial spray.;. With his throat cut, Mr. Leeds still tried to fight. Because the intruder was moving to the children's room... (beat) in the children's room the intruder shot the first boy in bed. Second boy was found in bed, but dustballs indicate he was dragged out from under his bed to be shot...
GRAHAM (CONT'D): (beat) Profusion of bloodstains and matted sliding marks on hall carpet and west wall of master bedroom remain unexplained... as does superficial chest, believed to be post-mortem. What did the killer do with them after they were dead? And before he put the boys back in their beds?
GRAHAM: There's a wicker dog bed on the back porch. There's a doghouse in the back yard. Where's the dog?
CONVENTIONEER #1: ...like to rip me off a piece of that!
CONVENTIONEER #2: Fuck her 'til her nose bleeds.
CONVENTIONEER #1: What the fuck are you lookin' at? CONVENTIONEER #l (being pulled out of elevator) What are you, a faggot?
GRAHAM: (into the tape recorder) When they were dead -- except possibly Mrs. Leeds -- he smashed the mirrors and began selecting shards that he used later on Mrs. Leeds... What did he do in the interval? Struggling with Mr. Leeds and killing the others would take less than a minute. What else? (beat) Three bloodstains on the east wall, not from Mr. Leed's arterial spray. What did killer do after they were dead?
GRAHAM: (into phone) Molly?
MOLLY (V.O.): (asleep) Huh? (beat) Will? Is that you?
GRAHAM: It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep. (beat) I love you...
MOLLY (V.O.): Mmmmh... I love you, too, Will. Good night.
GRAHAM: (into tape recorder) You moved the kids after you killed them, didn't you? Did you arrange them for your performance with Mrs. Leeds on their bed? Did you tie Mr. Leeds sitting up in bed? That's the postmortem ligature on his chest. Did you make them your audience? Did you open their eyes? There is something you can't afford for me to know about. Isn't there? Mrs. Leeds was lovely, wasn't she? It was maddening to have to wear gloves when you touched her, wasn't it? (beat) There was talcum powder on her leg. There was no talcum powder in the bathroom. (beat) The powder they found came out of a rubber glove as you pulled it off to touch her. You took off your glove to touch her. DIDN'T YOU, YOU SON-OF-A-BITCH?! You touched her with your bare hands! And then you put the gloves back an. And you wiped her down! While your gloves were off? (shouts)
GRAHAM: Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints?
CRAWFORD (V.O.): He's working on the single print index. What time is it? Get him to Atlanta.
CRAWFORD (V.O.): You said the guy down here is good.
GRAHAM: He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
CRAWFORD (V.O.): What do you want to do?
GRAHAM: Mrs. Leeds' fingernails and toenails. I think he took off his gloves, Jack. (heat) And dust all the corneas of all their eyes.
SPRINGFIELD: Our people swear he wore surgeons' gloves the whole time. They dusted everything.
GRAHAM: The report didn't mention nails and eyes.
SPRINGFIELD: Why do you think he took his gloves off?
GRAHAM: Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?
SPRINGFIELD: (sudden distaste) 'Intimate? !"
GRAHAM: Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy. (beat) Everybody else was dead.
SPRINGFIELD: All right. House to house interviews will be extended four additional blocks. R & I has loaned us two clerks to help cross-matching airline reservations between Birmingham last month and between Atlanta now. (beat) Dr. Princi.
DR. PRINCI: This is what the subject's teeth look like. The Smithsonian in Washington reconstructed them from the impressions we took of bite marks off the Leeds woman here and off the Jacobi woman last month in Birmingham. (beat) incisors -- the teeth here and here.
SPRINGFIELD: Investigator Graham has worked this kind of thing before. Can you add anything?
SPRINGFIELD: Can't hear you. Can you come up to the front?
GRAHAM: He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse.
SPRINGFIELD: He only bit women so far, right?
GRAHAM: That's all we know about.
GRAHAM (CONT'D): (beat) Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior. (beat) You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin... (beat) He bites a lot.
SPRINGFIELD: What's average?
GRAHAM: Sex murder: three. He likes to bite. Six bad ones in Mrs. Leeds. Eight in Mrs. Jacobi... (beat) ... that's all I have.
SPRINGFIELD: All right. Vice and Narcotics, take the K-Y cowboys and the leather bars. Marcus and Whitman heads up at the funeral. The rest of you, your assignments are on the sheet. Let's go.
SPRINGFIELD: One more thing: I've heard officers referring to the killer as the 'Tooth Fairy. (on laughter) Yeah, yeah, but I don't want to hear that in public or internal memoranda. That's it.
SPRINGFIELD: (to Crawford) We don't have shit, and we know it.
SPRINGFIELD: (to Graham) The Commissioner was saying you were the one that caught Dr. Lecter three years ago. (beat) He killed nine people, didn't he?
GRAHAM: Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
SPRINGFIELD: What happened to them?
GRAHAM: One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.
SPRINGFIELD: What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecter?
GRAHAM: Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
SPRINGFIELD: What would you call him?
SPRINGFIELD: To yourself...
GRAHAM: I call him a monster.
SPRINGFIELD: I understand he cut you pretty good...
GRAHAM: (cold right turn What about the dog?
SPRINGFIELD: It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl.
GRAHAM: Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?
SPRINGFIELD: No.
GRAHAM: Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog?
CRAWFORD: (alert) A cat. We found a litter box downstairs but not the cat. Neighbors are watching for it.
GRAHAM: Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard... maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
SPRINGFIELD: Yeah? (waits)
JIMMIE PRICE (V.O.): Who am I talking to?
CRAWIIORD: Jimmie, it's me, Jack Crawford, and you got Will Graham here.
JIMMIE PRICE (V.O.): I got a partial with a tented arch that's probably a thumb print and a fragment of a palm.
JIMMIE PRICE (V.O.): Came off the oldest kid's left eye. It stood out against an eight-ball hemorrhage from the gunshot wound.
CRAWFORD: Can you make an identification off it?
JIMMIE PRICE (V.O.): Don't know. The palm came off the nail of Mrs. Leeds' left big toe. I want to work these up in my own darkroom. I'll fax the prints down to you this afternoon.
LOUNDS: Will Graham! Remember me? Freddie Lounds? I covered the Lecter case for the Tattler. I did the paperback... !
LOUNDS: (running on, behind them) When did they call you in, Will? What have you got?
CRAWFORD: Lounds, give it a rest...
LOUNDS: Come on, Graham?! Talk to me!
LOUNDS: How does this guy compare with Lecter? How does he do them?
GRAHAM: (very low) Keep the fuck away from me!
CRAWFORD: (over his shoulder to Lounds) Get the hell away from here, Lounds!
GRAHAM: ...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls...
CRAWFORD: I know...
GRAHAM: (back to business) Atlanta and Birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders. Five will get you ten they don't come up with an identification. Jimmie may in the Finder program... if he's ever been printed and in his Index.

LECKTOR: I'll study it, Will. When you get more files, I'd like to see them, too. You can call me. When I have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone. Would you like to give me your home number?
GRAHAM: No.
LECKTOR: Do you know how you caught me, Will?
GRAHAM: Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can leave messages for me at the number on the file.
LECKTOR: Do you know how you caught me?
LECKTOR (O.S.): The reason you caught me, Will, is: we're just alike. You want the scent? Smell yourself.
